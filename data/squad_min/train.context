Initially , officials were unable to contact the Wolong National Nature Reserve , home to around 280 giant pandas . However , the Foreign Ministry later said that a group of 31 British tourists visiting the Wolong Panda Reserve in the quake-hit area returned safe and uninjured to Chengdu . Nonetheless , the well-being of an even greater number of pandas in the neighbouring panda reserves remained unknown . Five security guards at the reserve were killed by the earthquake . Six pandas escaped after their enclosures were damaged . By May 20 , two pandas at the reserve were found to be injured , while the search continued for another two adult pandas that went missing after the quake . By May 28 , 2008 , one panda was still missing . The missing panda was later found dead under the rubble of an enclosure . Nine-year-old Mao Mao , a mother of five at the breeding center , was discovered on Monday , her body crushed by a wall in her enclosure . Panda keepers and other workers placed her remains in a small wooden crate and buried her outside the breeding centre .
The map of earthquake intensity published by CEA after surveying 500,000 km2 of the affected area shows a maximum liedu of XI on the China Seismic Intensity Scale ( CSIS ) , described as " very destructive " on the European Macroseismic Scale ( EMS ) from which CSIS drew reference . ( USGS , using the Modified Mercalli intensity scale ( CC ) , also placed maximum intensity at XI , " very disastrous " . ) Two south-west-north-east stripes of liedu XI are centered around Yingxiu , Wenchuan ( the town closest to the epicenter of the main quake ) and Beichuan ( the town repeatedly struck by strong aftershocks including one registering MS 6.1 on Aug 1 , 2008 ) , both in Sichuan Province , occupying a total of 2,419 km2 . The Yingxiu liedu-XI zone is about 66 km long and 20 km wide along Wenchuan–Dujiangyan–Pengzhou ; the Beichuan liedu-XI zone is about 82 km long and 15 km wide along An County–Beichuan–Pingwu . The area with liedu X ( comparable to X on EMS , " destructive " and X on MM , " disastrous " ) spans 3,144 km2 . The area affected by earthquakes exceeding liedu VI totals 440,442 km2 , occupying an oval 936 km long and 596 km wide , spanning three provinces and one autonomous region .
In breeding circles , a male canine is referred to as a dog , while a female is called a bitch ( Middle English bicche , from Old English bicce , ultimately from Old Norse bikkja ) . A group of offspring is a litter . The father of a litter is called the sire , and the mother is called the dam . Offspring are , in general , called pups or puppies , from French poupée , until they are about a year old . The process of birth is whelping , from the Old English word hwelp .
The Edwardian era in the United Kingdom is the period spanning the reign of King Edward VII up to the end of the First World War , including the years surrounding the sinking of the RMS Titanic . In the early years of the period , the Second Boer War in South Africa split the country into anti- and pro-war factions . The imperial policies of the Conservatives eventually proved unpopular and in the general election of 1906 the Liberals won a huge landslide . The Liberal government was unable to proceed with all of its radical programme without the support of the House of Lords , which was largely Conservative . Conflict between the two Houses of Parliament over the People 's Budget led to a reduction in the power of the peers in 1910 . The general election in January that year returned a hung parliament with the balance of power held by Labour and Irish Nationalist members .
In 1629 , the Massachusetts Bay Colony 's first governor , John Winthrop , led the signing of the Cambridge Agreement , a key founding document of the city . Puritan ethics and their focus on education influenced its early history ; America 's first public school was founded in Boston in 1635 . Over the next 130 years , the city participated in four French and Indian Wars , until the British defeated the French and their native allies in North America . Boston was the largest town in British North America until Philadelphia grew larger in the mid 18th century .
Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of Paris in 1848 . His successor , Napoleon III , and the newly appointed prefect of the Seine , Georges-Eugène Haussmann , launched a gigantic public works project to build wide new boulevards , a new opera house , a central market , new aqueducts , sewers , and parks , including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes . In 1860 , Napoleon III also annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements , expanding Paris to its current limits .
Institutes of technology with different origins are Asian Institute of Technology , which developed from SEATO Graduate School of Engineering , and Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology , an engineering school of Thammasat University . Suranaree University of Technology is the only government-owned technological university in Thailand that was established ( 1989 ) as such ; while Mahanakorn University of Technology is the most well known private technological institute . Technology/Technical colleges in Thailand is associated with bitter rivalries which erupts into frequent off-campus brawls and assassinations of students in public locations that has been going on for nearly a decade , with innocent bystanders also commonly among the injured and the military under martial law still unable to stop them from occurring .
New York is a global hub of international business and commerce . In 2012 , New York City topped the first Global Economic Power Index , published by The Atlantic ( to be differentiated from a namesake list published by the Martin Prosperity Institute ) , with cities ranked according to criteria reflecting their presence on similar lists as published by other entities . The city is a major center for banking and finance , retailing , world trade , transportation , tourism , real estate , new media as well as traditional media , advertising , legal services , accountancy , insurance , theater , fashion , and the arts in the United States ; while Silicon Alley , metonymous for New York 's broad-spectrum high technology sphere , continues to expand . The Port of New York and New Jersey is also a major economic engine , handling record cargo volume in the first half of 2014 .
Temperatures below 0 °C ( 32 °F ) or above 25 °C ( 77 °F ) are rare . Cork Airport records an average of 1,227.9 millimetres ( 4.029 ft ) of precipitation annually , most of which is rain . The airport records an average of 7 days of hail and 11 days of snow or sleet a year ; though it only records lying snow for 2 days of the year . The low altitude of the city , and moderating influences of the harbour , mean that lying snow very rarely occurs in the city itself . There are on average 204 " rainy " days a year ( over 0.2 millimetres ( 0.0079 in ) of rainfall ) , of which there are 73 days with " heavy rain " ( over 5 millimetres ( 0.20 in ) ) . Cork is also a generally foggy city , with an average of 97 days of fog a year , most common during mornings and during winter . Despite this , however , Cork is also one of Ireland 's sunniest cities , with an average of 3.9 hours of sunshine every day and only having 67 days where there is no " recordable sunshine " , mostly during and around winter .
Roman government was headed by two consuls , elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate composed of appointed magistrates . As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards , the evolution of the Roman government was heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians , Rome 's land-holding aristocracy , who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome , and the plebeians , the far more numerous citizen-commoners . Over time , the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome 's highest offices were repealed or weakened , and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy . The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war , making military and political success inextricably linked . Many of Rome 's legal and legislative structures ( later codified into the Justinian Code , and again into the Napoleonic Code ) can still be observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern nation states and international organizations .
The Marshall Islands , officially the Republic of the Marshall Islands ( Marshallese : Aolepān Aorōkin M̧ajeļ ) , [ note 1 ] is an island country located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean , slightly west of the International Date Line . Geographically , the country is part of the larger island group of Micronesia . The country 's population of 53,158 people ( at the 2011 Census ) is spread out over 29 coral atolls , comprising 1,156 individual islands and islets . The islands share maritime boundaries with the Federated States of Micronesia to the west , Wake Island to the north , [ note 2 ] Kiribati to the south-east , and Nauru to the south . About 27,797 of the islanders ( at the 2011 Census ) live on Majuro , which contains the capital .
Season 11 premiered on January 18 , 2012 . On February 23 , it was announced that one more finalist would join the Top 24 making it the Top 25 , and that was Jermaine Jones . However , on March 14 , Jones was disqualified in 12th place for concealing arrests and outstanding warrants . Jones denied the accusation that he concealed his arrests .
Hazards to aircraft include debris , nesting birds , and reduced friction levels due to environmental conditions such as ice , snow , or rain . Part of runway maintenance is airfield rubber removal which helps maintain friction levels . The fields must be kept clear of debris using cleaning equipment so that loose material does not become a projectile and enter an engine duct ( see foreign object damage ) . In adverse weather conditions , ice and snow clearing equipment can be used to improve traction on the landing strip . For waiting aircraft , equipment is used to spray special deicing fluids on the wings .
By the late 1960s , many of the resort 's once great hotels were suffering from embarrassing vacancy rates . Most of them were either shut down , converted to cheap apartments , or converted to nursing home facilities by the end of the decade . Prior to and during the advent of legalized gaming , many of these hotels were demolished . The Breakers , the Chelsea , the Brighton , the Shelburne , the Mayflower , the Traymore , and the Marlborough-Blenheim were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s . Of the many pre-casino resorts that bordered the boardwalk , only the Claridge , the Dennis , the Ritz-Carlton , and the Haddon Hall survive to this day as parts of Bally 's Atlantic City , a condo complex , and Resorts Atlantic City . The old Ambassador Hotel was purchased by Ramada in 1978 and was gutted to become the Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City , only reusing the steelwork of the original building . Smaller hotels off the boardwalk , such as the Madison also survived .
Players may only be transferred during transfer windows that are set by the Football Association . The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January . Player registrations can not be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA , usually on an emergency basis . As of the 2010–11 season , the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21 , with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances . This was to enable the 'home grown ' rule to be enacted , whereby the League would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to be made up of 'home-grown players ' .
In ancient China , early literature was primarily focused on philosophy , historiography , military science , agriculture , and poetry . China , the origin of modern paper making and woodblock printing , produced one of the world 's first print cultures . Much of Chinese literature originates with the Hundred Schools of Thought period that occurred during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty ( 769-269 BCE ) . The most important of these include the Classics of Confucianism , of Daoism , of Mohism , of Legalism , as well as works of military science ( e.g . Sun Tzu 's The Art of War ) and Chinese history ( e.g . Sima Qian 's Records of the Grand Historian ) . Ancient Chinese literature had a heavy emphasis on historiography , with often very detailed court records . An exemplary piece of narrative history of ancient China was the Zuo Zhuan , which was compiled no later than 389 BCE , and attributed to the blind 5th century BCE historian Zuo Qiuming .
Genocide has become an official term used in international relations . The word genocide was not in use before 1944 . Before this , in 1941 , Winston Churchill described the mass killing of Russian prisoners of war and civilians as " a crime without a name " . In that year , a Polish-Jewish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin , described the policies of systematic murder founded by the Nazis as genocide . The word genocide is the combination of the Greek prefix geno- ( meaning tribe or race ) and caedere ( the Latin word for to kill ) . The word is defined as a specific set of violent crimes that are committed against a certain group with the attempt to remove the entire group from existence or to destroy them .
After Austerlitz , Napoleon established the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 . A collection of German states intended to serve as a buffer zone between France and Central Europe , the creation of the Confederation spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire and significantly alarmed the Prussians . The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region , if not eliminating it outright . War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806 . At the insistence of his court , especially his wife Queen Louise , Frederick William III decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war .
There are several technologies aimed to provide better experience to passengers suffering from claustrophobia , anthropophobia or social anxiety . Israeli startup DigiGage uses motion sensors to scroll the pre-rendered images , building and floor-specific content on a screen embedded into the wall as the cab moves up and down . British company LiftEye provides a virtual window technology to turn common elevator into panoramic . It creates 3d video panorama using live feed from cameras placed vertically along the facade and synchronizes it with cab movement . The video is projected on a wall-sized screens making it look like the walls are made of glass .
Among the largest non-state-run research institutions in Portugal are the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência and the Champalimaud Foundation , a neuroscience and oncology research centre , which in addition awards every year one of the highest monetary prizes of any science prize in the world . A number of both national and multinational high-tech and industrial companies , are also responsible for research and development projects . One of the oldest learned societies of Portugal is the Sciences Academy of Lisbon , founded in 1779 .
The years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the " Big Four " with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City both breaking into the top four . In the 2009–10 season , Tottenham finished fourth and became the first team to break the top four since Everton in 2005 . Criticism of the gap between an elite group of " super clubs " and the majority of the Premier League has continued , nevertheless , due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs . Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season , becoming the first club outside the " Big Four " to win since 1994–95 . That season also saw two of the Big Four ( Chelsea and Liverpool ) finish outside the top four places for the first time since 1994–95 .
In physics , Whitehead 's thought has had some influence . He articulated a view that might perhaps be regarded as dual to Einstein 's general relativity , see Whitehead 's theory of gravitation . It has been severely criticized . Yutaka Tanaka , who suggests that the gravitational constant disagrees with experimental findings , proposes that Einstein 's work does not actually refute Whitehead 's formulation . Whitehead 's view has now been rendered obsolete , with the discovery of gravitational waves . They are phenonena observed locally that largely violate the kind of local flatness of space that Whitehead assumes . Consequently , Whitehead 's cosmology must be regarded as a local approximation , and his assumption of a uniform spatio-temporal geometry , Minkowskian in particular , as an often-locally-adequate approximation . An exact replacement of Whitehead 's cosmology would need to admit a Riemannian geometry . Also , although Whitehead himself gave only secondary consideration to quantum theory , his metaphysics of processes has proved attractive to some physicists in that field . Henry Stapp and David Bohm are among those whose work has been influenced by Whitehead .
Another aspect of anti-aircraft defence was the use of barrage balloons to act as physical obstacle initially to bomber aircraft over cities and later for ground attack aircraft over the Normandy invasion fleets . The balloon , a simple blimp tethered to the ground , worked in two ways . Firstly , it and the steel cable were a danger to any aircraft that tried to fly among them . Secondly , to avoid the balloons , bombers had to fly at a higher altitude , which was more favorable for the guns . Barrage balloons were limited in application , and had minimal success at bringing down aircraft , being largely immobile and passive defences .
The Bovington signal course 's director reported that Gaddafi successfully overcame problems learning English , displaying a firm command of voice procedure . Noting that Gaddafi 's favourite hobbies were reading and playing football , he thought him an " amusing officer , always cheerful , hard-working , and conscientious . " Gaddafi disliked England , claiming British Army officers racially insulted him and finding it difficult adjusting to the country 's culture ; asserting his Arab identity in London , he walked around Piccadilly wearing traditional Libyan robes . He later related that while he travelled to England believing it more advanced than Libya , he returned home " more confident and proud of our values , ideals and social character . "
Ephesus is a cultic centre of Mary , the site of the first Church dedicated to her and the rumoured place of her death . Ephesus was previously a centre for worship of Artemis a virgin goddess . The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus being regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World The cult of Mary was furthered by Queen Theodora in the 6th Century . According to William E. Phipps , in the book Survivals of Roman Religion " Gordon Laing argues convincingly that the worship of Artemis as both virgin and mother at the grand Ephesian temple contributed to the veneration of Mary . "
Since the 2010 election , the government has embarked on a series of reforms to direct the country towards liberal democracy , a mixed economy , and reconciliation , although doubts persist about the motives that underpin such reforms . The series of reforms includes the release of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest , the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission , the granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners , new labour laws that permit labour unions and strikes , a relaxation of press censorship , and the regulation of currency practices .
Paris ' manufacturing is mostly focused in its suburbs , and the city itself has only around 75,000 manufacturing workers , most of which are in the textile , clothing , leather goods and shoe trades . Paris region manufacturing specialises in transportation , mainly automobiles , aircraft and trains , but this is in a sharp decline : Paris proper manufacturing jobs dropped by 64 percent between 1990 and 2010 , and the Paris region lost 48 percent during the same period . Most of this is due to companies relocating outside the Paris region . The Paris region 's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000 . Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers : many of these are centred in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citroen plants ( this department alone employs 33,000 ) , but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citroen assembly plant .
Animals are also involved in the distribution of seeds . Fruit , which is formed by the enlargement of flower parts , is frequently a seed-dispersal tool that attracts animals to eat or otherwise disturb it , incidentally scattering the seeds it contains ( see frugivory ) . Although many such mutualistic relationships remain too fragile to survive competition and to spread widely , flowering proved to be an unusually effective means of reproduction , spreading ( whatever its origin ) to become the dominant form of land plant life .
Dallin H. Oaks replaced Wilkinson as president in 1971 . Oaks continued the expansion of his predecessor , adding a law school and proposing plans for a new School of Management . During his administration , a new library was also added , doubling the library space on campus . Jeffrey R. Holland followed as president in 1980 , encouraging a combination of educational excellence and religious faith at the university . He believed that one of the school 's greatest strengths was its religious nature and that this should be taken advantage of rather than hidden . During his administration , the university added a campus in Jerusalem , now called the BYU Jerusalem Center . In 1989 , Holland was replaced by Rex E. Lee . Lee was responsible for the Benson Science Building and the Museum of Art on campus . A cancer victim , Lee is memorialized annually at BYU during a cancer fundraiser called the Rex Lee Run . Shortly before his death , Lee was replaced in 1995 by Merrill J. Bateman .
The title of " world 's oldest airport " is disputed , but College Park Airport in Maryland , US , established in 1909 by Wilbur Wright , is generally agreed to be the world 's oldest continually operating airfield , although it serves only general aviation traffic . Bisbee-Douglas International Airport in Arizona was declared " the first international airport of the Americas " by US president Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1943 . Pearson Field Airport in Vancouver , Washington had a dirigible land in 1905 and planes in 1911 and is still in use . Bremen Airport opened in 1913 and remains in use , although it served as an American military field between 1945 and 1949 . Amsterdam Airport Schiphol opened on September 16 , 1916 as a military airfield , but only accepted civil aircraft from December 17 , 1920 , allowing Sydney Airport in Sydney , Australia—which started operations in January 1920—to claim to be one of the world 's oldest continually operating commercial airports . Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport in Minneapolis-Saint Paul , Minnesota , opened in 1920 and has been in continuous commercial service since . It serves about 35,000,000 passengers each year and continues to expand , recently opening a new 11,000 foot ( 3,355 meter ) runway . Of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation , it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating . Rome Ciampino Airport , opened 1916 , is also a contender , as well as the Don Mueang International Airport near Bangkok , Thailand , which opened in 1914 . Increased aircraft traffic during World War I led to the construction of landing fields . Aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope .
In the Papal States , which existed until 1870 , Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called ghettos . In the 19th and ( before the end of World War II ) 20th centuries , the Roman Catholic Church adhered to a distinction between " good antisemitism " and " bad antisemitism " . The " bad " kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent . This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity ; anyone could become a Christian . The " good " kind criticized alleged Jewish conspiracies to control newspapers , banks , and other institutions , to care only about accumulation of wealth , etc .
The value judgement definition of literature considers it to exclusively include writing that possesses high quality or distinction , forming part of the so-called belles-lettres ( 'fine writing ' ) tradition . This is the definition used in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition ( 1910–11 ) when it classifies literature as " the best expression of the best thought reduced to writing . " However , this has the result that there is no objective definition of what constitutes " literature " ; anything can be literature , and anything which is universally regarded as literature has the potential to be excluded , since value-judgements can change over time .
The oldest rocks in the group are in the north west of Scotland , Ireland and North Wales and are 2,700 million years old . During the Silurian period the north-western regions collided with the south-east , which had been part of a separate continental landmass . The topography of the islands is modest in scale by global standards . Ben Nevis rises to an elevation of only 1,344 metres ( 4,409 ft ) , and Lough Neagh , which is notably larger than other lakes on the isles , covers 390 square kilometres ( 151 sq mi ) . The climate is temperate marine , with mild winters and warm summers . The North Atlantic Drift brings significant moisture and raises temperatures 11 °C ( 20 °F ) above the global average for the latitude . This led to a landscape which was long dominated by temperate rainforest , although human activity has since cleared the vast majority of forest cover . The region was re-inhabited after the last glacial period of Quaternary glaciation , by 12,000 BC when Great Britain was still a peninsula of the European continent . Ireland , which became an island by 12,000 BC , was not inhabited until after 8000 BC . Great Britain became an island by 5600 BC .
The term Hokkien ( 福建 ; hɔk˥˥kɪɛn˨˩ ) is itself a term not used in Chinese to refer to the dialect , as it simply means Fujian province . In Chinese linguistics , these dialects are known by their classification under the Quanzhang Division ( Chinese : 泉漳片 ; pinyin : Quánzhāng piàn ) of Min Nan , which comes from the first characters of the two main Hokkien urban centers Quanzhou and Zhangzhou . The variety is also known by other terms such as the more general Min Nan ( traditional Chinese : 閩南語 , 閩南話 ; simplified Chinese : 闽南语 , 闽南话 ; pinyin : Mǐnnányǔ , Mǐnnánhuà ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : Bân-lâm-gí , Bân-lâm-oē ) or Southern Min , and Fulaohua ( traditional Chinese : 福佬話 ; simplified Chinese : 福佬话 ; pinyin : Fúlǎohuà ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : Hō-ló-oē ) . The term Hokkien ( Chinese : 福建話 ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : hok-kiàn oē ; Tâi-lô : Hok-kiàn-uē ) , on the other hand , is used commonly in South East Asia to refer to Min-nan dialects .
The CD was planned to be the successor of the gramophone record for playing music , rather than primarily as a data storage medium . From its origins as a musical format , CDs have grown to encompass other applications . In 1983 , following the CD 's introduction , Immink and Braat presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd AES Convention . In June 1985 , the computer-readable CD-ROM ( read-only memory ) and , in 1990 , CD-Recordable were introduced , also developed by both Sony and Philips . Recordable CDs were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods . Other newer video formats such as DVD and Blu-ray use the same physical geometry as CD , and most DVD and Blu-ray players are backward compatible with audio CD .
Victoria wrote to her uncle Leopold , whom Victoria considered her " best and kindest adviser " , to thank him " for the prospect of great happiness you have contributed to give me , in the person of dear Albert ... He possesses every quality that could be desired to render me perfectly happy . He is so sensible , so kind , and so good , and so amiable too . He has besides the most pleasing and delightful exterior and appearance you can possibly see . " However at 17 , Victoria , though interested in Albert , was not yet ready to marry . The parties did not undertake a formal engagement , but assumed that the match would take place in due time .
Though the iPod was released in 2001 , its price and Mac-only compatibility caused sales to be relatively slow until 2004 . The iPod line came from Apple 's " digital hub " category , when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices . Digital cameras , camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets , but the company found existing digital music players " big and clunky or small and useless " with user interfaces that were " unbelievably awful , " so Apple decided to develop its own . As ordered by CEO Steve Jobs , Apple 's hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line , including hardware engineers Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey , and design engineer Sir Jonathan Ive . Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba disk drive when meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan , and purchased the rights to it for Apple , and had also already worked out how the screen , battery , and other key elements would work . The aesthetic was inspired by the 1958 Braun T3 transistor radio designed by Dieter Rams , while the wheel based user interface was prompted by Bang & Olufsen 's BeoCom 6000 telephone . The product ( " the Walkman of the twenty-first century " ) was developed in less than one year and unveiled on October 23 , 2001 . Jobs announced it as a Mac-compatible product with a 5 GB hard drive that put " 1,000 songs in your pocket . "
On 25 January 1952 , a confrontation between British forces and police at Ismailia resulted in the deaths of 40 Egyptian policemen , provoking riots in Cairo the next day which left 76 people dead . Afterwards , Nasser published a simple six-point program in Rose al-Yūsuf to dismantle feudalism and British influence in Egypt . In May , Nasser received word that Farouk knew the names of the Free Officers and intended to arrest them ; he immediately entrusted Free Officer Zakaria Mohieddin with the task of planning the government takeover by army units loyal to the association .
Electricity in the Richmond Metro area is provided by Dominion Virginia Power . The company , based in Richmond , is one of the nation 's largest producers of energy , serving retail energy customers in nine states . Electricity is provided in the Richmond area primarily by the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station and Surry Nuclear Generating Station , as well as a coal-fired station in Chester , Virginia . These three plants provide a total of 4,453 megawatts of power . Several other natural gas plants provide extra power during times of peak demand . These include facilities in Chester , and Surry , and two plants in Richmond ( Gravel Neck and Darbytown ) .
Season three premiered on January 19 , 2004 . One of the most talked-about contestants during the audition process was William Hung whose off-key rendition of Ricky Martin 's " She Bangs " received widespread attention . His exposure on Idol landed him a record deal and surprisingly he became the third best-selling singer from that season .
Insects ( from Latin insectum , a calque of Greek ἔντομον [ éntomon ] , " cut into sections " ) are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton , a three-part body ( head , thorax and abdomen ) , three pairs of jointed legs , compound eyes and one pair of antennae . They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet , including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms . The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million , and potentially represent over 90 % of the differing animal life forms on Earth . Insects may be found in nearly all environments , although only a small number of species reside in the oceans , a habitat dominated by another arthropod group , crustaceans .
UNFPA works in partnership with governments , along with other United Nations agencies , communities , NGOs , foundations and the private sector , to raise awareness and mobilize the support and resources needed to achieve its mission to promote the rights and health of women and young people .
Located in the American South , Houston is a diverse city with a large and growing international community . The metropolitan area is home to an estimated 1.1 million ( 21.4 percent ) residents who were born outside the United States , with nearly two-thirds of the area 's foreign-born population from south of the United States–Mexico border . Additionally , more than one in five foreign-born residents are from Asia . The city is home to the nation 's third-largest concentration of consular offices , representing 86 countries .
Originally based on the English alphabet , ASCII encodes 128 specified characters into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart on the right . The characters encoded are numbers 0 to 9 , lowercase letters a to z , uppercase letters A to Z , basic punctuation symbols , control codes that originated with Teletype machines , and a space . For example , lowercase j would become binary 1101010 and decimal 106 . ASCII includes definitions for 128 characters : 33 are non-printing control characters ( many now obsolete ) that affect how text and space are processed and 95 printable characters , including the space ( which is considered an invisible graphic:223 ) .
At 36,125 square kilometres ( 13,948 sq mi ) , the country is larger in size than Taiwan or Belgium . It lies at a low altitude ; its highest point is 300 metres ( 984 ft ) . The terrain of is mostly low coastal plain with swamps of Guinean mangroves rising to Guinean forest-savanna mosaic in the east . Its monsoon-like rainy season alternates with periods of hot , dry harmattan winds blowing from the Sahara . The Bijagos Archipelago lies off of the mainland .
In the 1980s , mixed tag team matches began to take place , with a male and female on each team and a rule stating that each wrestler could only attack the opponent of the same gender . If a tag was made , the other team had to automatically switch their legal wrestler as well . Despite these restrictions , many mixed tag matches do feature some physical interaction between participants of different genders . For example , a heel may take a cheap shot at the female wrestler of the opposing team to draw a negative crowd reaction . In lucha libre , cheap-shots and male-female attacks are not uncommon .
The cantons have a permanent constitutional status and , in comparison with the situation in other countries , a high degree of independence . Under the Federal Constitution , all 26 cantons are equal in status . Each canton has its own constitution , and its own parliament , government and courts . However , there are considerable differences between the individual cantons , most particularly in terms of population and geographical area . Their populations vary between 15,000 ( Appenzell Innerrhoden ) and 1,253,500 ( Zürich ) , and their area between 37 km2 ( 14 sq mi ) ( Basel-Stadt ) and 7,105 km2 ( 2,743 sq mi ) ( Graubünden ) . The Cantons comprise a total of 2,485 municipalities . Within Switzerland there are two enclaves : Büsingen belongs to Germany , Campione d'Italia belongs to Italy .
Thomas J. Watson , Sr. , fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson , called on Flint and , in 1914 , was offered CTR . Watson joined CTR as General Manager then , 11 months later , was made President when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved . Having learned Patterson 's pioneering business practices , Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR 's companies . He implemented sales conventions , " generous sales incentives , a focus on customer service , an insistence on well-groomed , dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker " . His favorite slogan , " THINK " , became a mantra for each company 's employees . During Watson 's first four years , revenues more than doubled to $ 9 million and the company 's operations expanded to Europe , South America , Asia and Australia . " Watson had never liked the clumsy hyphenated title of the CTR " and chose to replace it with the more expansive title " International Business Machines " . First as a name for a 1917 Canadian subsidiary , then as a line in advertisements . For example , the McClures magazine , v53 , May 1921 , has a full page ad with , at the bottom :
In the midst of the European sovereign-debt crisis , Radek Sikorski , Poland 's Foreign Minister , stated in November 2011 , " I will probably be the first Polish foreign minister in history to say so , but here it is : I fear German power less than I am beginning to fear German inactivity . You have become Europe 's indispensable nation . " According to Jacob Heilbrunn , a senior editor at The National Interest , such a statement is unprecedented when taking into consideration Germany 's history . " This was an extraordinary statement from a top official of a nation that was ravaged by Germany during World War II . And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin 's position at the center of the Continent . " Heilbrunn believes that the adage , " what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union " has been supplanted by a new mentality—what is in the interest of Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors . The evolution in Germany 's national identity stems from focusing less on its Nazi past and more on its Prussian history , which many Germans believe was betrayed—and not represented—by Nazism . The evolution is further precipitated by Germany 's conspicuous position as Europe 's strongest economy . Indeed , this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it , as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski 's effusive praise for his country 's western neighbor . This shift in thinking is boosted by a newer generation of Germans who see World War II as a distant memory .
The constraints of constructing a flight deck affect the role of a given carrier strongly , as they influence the weight , type , and configuration of the aircraft that may be launched . For example , assisted launch mechanisms are used primarily for heavy aircraft , especially those loaded with air-to-ground weapons . CATOBAR is most commonly used on USN supercarriers as it allows the deployment of heavy jets with full loadouts , especially on ground-attack missions . STOVL is used by other navies because it is cheaper to operate and still provides good deployment capability for fighter aircraft .
In the early 21st century , Republican voters control most of the state , especially in the more rural and suburban areas outside of the cities ; Democratic strength is mostly confined to the urban cores of the four major cities , and is particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis . The latter area includes a large African-American population . Historically , Republicans had their greatest strength in East Tennessee before the 1960s . Tennessee 's 1st and 2nd congressional districts , based in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville , respectively , are among the few historically Republican districts in the South . Those districts ' residents supported the Union over the Confederacy during the Civil War ; they identified with the GOP after the war and have stayed with that party ever since . The 1st has been in Republican hands continuously since 1881 , and Republicans ( or their antecedents ) have held it for all but four years since 1859 . The 2nd has been held continuously by Republicans or their antecedents since 1859 .
Islam is the most widely practised religion in Southeast Asia , numbering approximately 240 million adherents which translate to about 40 % of the entire population , with majorities in Indonesia , Brunei , Malaysia and in Southern Philippines with Indonesia as the largest and most populated Muslim country around the world . Countries in Southeast Asia practice many different religions . Buddhism is predominant in Thailand , Cambodia , Laos , Burma , Vietnam and Singapore . Ancestor worship and Confucianism are also widely practised in Vietnam and Singapore . Christianity is predominant in the Philippines , eastern Indonesia , East Malaysia and East Timor . The Philippines has the largest Roman Catholic population in Asia . East Timor is also predominantly Roman Catholic due to a history of Portuguese rule .
Anthropology is the study of humans and their societies in the past and present . Its main subdivisions are social anthropology and cultural anthropology , which describes the workings of societies around the world , linguistic anthropology , which investigates the influence of language in social life , and biological or physical anthropology , which concerns long-term development of the human organism . Archaeology , which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence , is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States , while in Europe , it is viewed as a discipline in its own right , or grouped under other related disciplines such as history .
One of the characteristics of BYU most often pointed out is its reputation for emphasizing a " marriage culture " . Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints highly value marriage and family , especially marriage within the faith . Approximately 51 percent of the graduates in BYU 's class of 2005 were married . This is compared to a national marriage average among college graduates of 11 percent . BYU students on average marry at the age of 22 , according to a 2005 study , while the national average age is 25 years for men and 27 years for women .
Common energy forms include the kinetic energy of a moving object , the potential energy stored by an object 's position in a force field ( gravitational , electric or magnetic ) , the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects , the chemical energy released when a fuel burns , the radiant energy carried by light , and the thermal energy due to an object 's temperature . All of the many forms of energy are convertible to other kinds of energy . In Newtonian physics , there is a universal law of conservation of energy which says that energy can be neither created nor be destroyed ; however , it can change from one form to another .
Defining exactly what section of a DNA sequence comprises a gene is difficult . Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have to be close to the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity . Similarly , a gene 's introns can be much larger than its exons . Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome .
Between 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941 , 16 British cities suffered aerial raids with at least 100 long tons of high explosives . Over a period of 267 days , London was attacked 71 times , Birmingham , Liverpool and Plymouth eight times , Bristol six , Glasgow five , Southampton four , Portsmouth and Hull three and a minimum of one large raid on eight other cities . This was a result of a rapid escalation starting on 24 August 1940 , when night bombers aiming for RAF airfields drifted off course and accidentally destroyed several London homes , killing civilians , combined with the UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill 's retaliatory bombing of Berlin on the following night . [ clarification needed ]
Mexico city primarily rests on what was Lake Texcoco . Seismic activity is frequent here . Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century . Although none of the lake waters remain , the city rests on the lake bed 's heavily saturated clay . This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater , called groundwater-related subsidence . Since the beginning of the 20th century the city has sunk as much as nine metres ( 30 feet ) in some areas . This sinking is causing problems with runoff and wastewater management , leading to flooding problems , especially during the rainy season . The entire lake bed is now paved over and most of the city 's remaining forested areas lie in the southern boroughs of Milpa Alta , Tlalpan and Xochimilco .
The Śātavāhana Empire was a royal Indian dynasty based from Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh as well as Junnar ( Pune ) and Prathisthan ( Paithan ) in Maharashtra . The territory of the empire covered much of India from 230 BCE onward . Sātavāhanas started out as feudatories to the Mauryan dynasty , but declared independence with its decline . They are known for their patronage of Hinduism and Buddhism which resulted in Buddhist monuments from Ellora ( a UNESCO World Heritage Site ) to Amaravati . The Sātavāhanas were one of the first Indian states to issue coins struck with their rulers embossed . They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade as well as the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the southern tip of India . They had to compete with the Shunga Empire and then the Kanva dynasty of Magadha to establish their rule . Later , they played a crucial role to protect a huge part of India against foreign invaders like the Sakas , Yavanas and Pahlavas . In particular their struggles with the Western Kshatrapas went on for a long time . The notable rulers of the Satavahana Dynasty Gautamiputra Satakarni and Sri Yajna Sātakarni were able to defeat the foreign invaders like the Western Kshatrapas and to stop their expansion . In the 3rd century CE the empire was split into smaller states .
Commercial CSP plants were first developed in the 1980s . Since 1985 the eventually 354 MW SEGS CSP installation , in the Mojave Desert of California , is the largest solar power plant in the world . Other large CSP plants include the 150 MW Solnova Solar Power Station and the 100 MW Andasol solar power station , both in Spain . The 250 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project , in the United States , and the 221 MW Charanka Solar Park in India , are the world’s largest photovoltaic plants . Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed , but most of the deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5 kW , which are grid connected using net metering and/or a feed-in tariff . In 2013 solar generated less than 1 % of the worlds total grid electricity .
Ajahn Sucitto describes the path as " a mandala of interconnected factors that support and moderate each other . " The eight factors of the path are not to be understood as stages , in which each stage is completed before moving on to the next . Rather , they are understood as eight significant dimensions of one 's behaviour—mental , spoken , and bodily—that operate in dependence on one another ; taken together , they define a complete path , or way of living .
In response to organized crime , on August 25 , 1953 , the FBI created the Top Hoodlum Program . The national office directed field offices to gather information on mobsters in their territories and to report it regularly to Washington for a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers . After the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act , or RICO Act , took effect , the FBI began investigating the former Prohibition-organized groups , which had become fronts for crime in major cities and small towns . All of the FBI work was done undercover and from within these organizations , using the provisions provided in the RICO Act . Gradually the agency dismantled many of the groups . Although Hoover initially denied the existence of a National Crime Syndicate in the United States , the Bureau later conducted operations against known organized crime syndicates and families , including those headed by Sam Giancana and John Gotti . The RICO Act is still used today for all organized crime and any individuals who might fall under the Act .
The monogram theme was developed into an Art Deco-style badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F , the whole set within a hexagonal border . This early example of a corporate logo , introduced as part of Herbert Chapman 's rebranding of the club in the 1930s , was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium , including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors . From 1967 , a white cannon was regularly worn on the shirts , until replaced by the club crest , sometimes with the addition of the nickname " The Gunners " , in the 1990s .
Despite the initial negative press , several websites have given the system very good reviews mostly regarding its hardware . CNET United Kingdom praised the system saying , " the PS3 is a versatile and impressive piece of home-entertainment equipment that lives up to the hype [ ... ] the PS3 is well worth its hefty price tag . " CNET awarded it a score of 8.8 out of 10 and voted it as its number one " must-have " gadget , praising its robust graphical capabilities and stylish exterior design while criticizing its limited selection of available games . In addition , both Home Theater Magazine and Ultimate AV have given the system 's Blu-ray playback very favorable reviews , stating that the quality of playback exceeds that of many current standalone Blu-ray Disc players .
Twins ( 1988 ) , a comedy with Danny DeVito , also proved successful . Total Recall ( 1990 ) netted Schwarzenegger $ 10 million and 15 % of the film 's gross . A science fiction script , the film was based on the Philip K. Dick short story " We Can Remember It for You Wholesale " . Kindergarten Cop ( 1990 ) reunited him with director Ivan Reitman , who directed him in Twins . Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing , first with a 1990 episode of the TV series Tales from the Crypt , entitled " The Switch " , and then with the 1992 telemovie Christmas in Connecticut . He has not directed since .
A climbing elevator is a self-ascending elevator with its own propulsion . The propulsion can be done by an electric or a combustion engine . Climbing elevators are used in guyed masts or towers , in order to make easy access to parts of these constructions , such as flight safety lamps for maintenance . An example would be the Moonlight towers in Austin , Texas , where the elevator holds only one person and equipment for maintenance . The Glasgow Tower — an observation tower in Glasgow , Scotland — also makes use of two climbing elevators .
In 2004 , SME and Bertelsmann Music Group merged as Sony BMG Music Entertainment . When Sony acquired BMG 's half of the conglomerate in 2008 , Sony BMG reverted to the SME name . The buyout led to the dissolution of BMG , which then relaunched as BMG Rights Management . Out of the " Big Three " record companies , with Universal Music Group being the largest and Warner Music Group , SME is middle-sized .
In 1870 , following the stunning defeat of the French Army by the Germans in the Franco-Prussian War , French workers and socialist revolutionaries seized Paris and created the Paris Commune . The Commune lasted for two months before it was crushed by the French Army , with much bloodshed . The original red banners of the Commune became icons of the socialist revolution ; in 1921 members of the French Communist Party came to Moscow and presented the new Soviet government with one of the original Commune banners ; it was placed ( and is still in place ) in the tomb of Vladimir Lenin , next to his open coffin .
The oldest method of studying the brain is anatomical , and until the middle of the 20th century , much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes . Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components , especially synapses . Among other tools , they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure , chemistry , and connectivity . In recent years , the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes . Also , functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior .
Specification-based testing aims to test the functionality of software according to the applicable requirements . This level of testing usually requires thorough test cases to be provided to the tester , who then can simply verify that for a given input , the output value ( or behavior ) , either " is " or " is not " the same as the expected value specified in the test case . Test cases are built around specifications and requirements , i.e. , what the application is supposed to do . It uses external descriptions of the software , including specifications , requirements , and designs to derive test cases . These tests can be functional or non-functional , though usually functional .
Pope John XXIII offered to mediate between US President John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 . Both men applauded the pope for his deep commitment to peace . Khrushchev would later send a message via Norman Cousins and the letter expressed his best wishes for the pontiff 's ailing health . John XXIII personally typed and sent a message back to him , thanking him for his letter . Cousins , meanwhile , travelled to New York City and ensured that John would become Time magazine 's 'Man of the Year ' . John XXIII became the first Pope to receive the title , followed by John Paul II in 1994 and Francis in 2013 .
Darwin continued to research and extensively revise his theory while focusing on his main work of publishing the scientific results of the Beagle voyage . He tentatively wrote of his ideas to Lyell in January 1842 ; then in June he roughed out a 35-page " Pencil Sketch " of his theory . Darwin began correspondence about his theorising with the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker in January 1844 , and by July had rounded out his " sketch " into a 230-page " Essay " , to be expanded with his research results and published if he died prematurely .
The work of children was important in pre-industrial societies , as children needed to provide their labour for their survival and that of their group . Pre-industrial societies were characterised by low productivity and short life expectancy , preventing children from participating in productive work would be more harmful to their welfare and that of their group in the long run . In pre-industrial societies , there was little need for children to attend school . This is especially the case in non literate societies . Most pre-industrial skill and knowledge were amenable to being passed down through direct mentoring or apprenticing by competent adults .
In mid 2011 , the Foundation announced in its new " Water , Sanitation , Hygiene Strategy Overview " that its funding now focuses primarily on sanitation , particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia , because access to improved sanitation is lowest in those regions . Their grant-making focus has been since 2011 on sanitation science and technology ( " transformative technologies " ) , delivery models at scale , urban sanitation markets , building demand for sanitation , measurement and evaluation as well as policy , advocacy and communications .
Although the Spanish Empire had a residual claim on the Marshalls in 1874 , when she began asserting her sovereignty over the Carolines , she made no effort to prevent the German Empire from gaining a foothold there . Britain also raised no objection to a German protectorate over the Marshalls in exchange for German recognition of Britain 's rights in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands . On October 13 , 1885 , SMS Nautilus under Captain Rötger brought German emissaries to Jaluit . They signed a treaty with Kabua , whom the Germans had earlier recognized as " King of the Ralik Islands , " on October 15 .
On December 8 , the leaders of Russia , Ukraine , and Belarus secretly met in Belavezhskaya Pushcha , in western Belarus , and signed the Belavezha Accords , which proclaimed the Soviet Union had ceased to exist and announced formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) as a looser association to take its place . They also invited other republics to join the CIS . Gorbachev called it an unconstitutional coup . However , by this time there was no longer any reasonable doubt that , as the preamble of the Accords put it , " the USSR , as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality , is ceasing its existence . "
In May 1985 , Gorbachev delivered a speech in Leningrad advocating reforms and an anti-alcohol campaign to tackle widespread alcoholism . Prices on vodka , wine , and beer were raised in order to make these drinks more expensive and a disincentive to consumers , and the introduction of rationing . Unlike most forms of rationing intended to conserve scarce goods , this was done to restrict sales with the overt goal of curtailing drunkenness . Gorbachev 's plan also included billboards promoting sobriety , increased penalties for public drunkenness , and to censor drinking scenes from old movies . Although this program was not a direct copycat of Tsar Nicholas II 's outright prohibition during World War I , Gorbachev faced the same adverse economic reaction as did the last Tsar . The disincentivization of alcohol consumption was a serious blow to the state budget according to Alexander Yakovlev , who noted annual collections of alcohol taxes decreased by 100 billion rubles . Alcohol production migrated to the black market , or through moonshining as some made " bathtub vodka " with homegrown potatoes . Poorer , less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes such as nail polish , rubbing alcohol or men 's cologne , which only served to be an additional burden on Russia 's healthcare sector due to the subsequent poisoning cases . The purpose of these reforms , however , was to prop up the existing centrally planned economy , unlike later reforms , which tended toward market socialism .
Spielberg 's next film , Schindler 's List , was based on the true story of Oskar Schindler , a man who risked his life to save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust . Schindler 's List earned Spielberg his first Academy Award for Best Director ( it also won Best Picture ) . With the film a huge success at the box office , Spielberg used the profits to set up the Shoah Foundation , a non-profit organization that archives filmed testimony of Holocaust survivors . In 1997 , the American Film Institute listed it among the 10 Greatest American Films ever Made ( # 9 ) which moved up to ( # 8 ) when the list was remade in 2007 .
Since the Spanish transition to democracy ( 1975–1982 ) , Catalan has been recognized as an official language , language of education , and language of mass media , all of which have contributed to its increased prestige . There is no parallel in Europe of such a large , bilingual , non-state speech community .
The restoration of power to the patriciate was only temporary . After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes such as the Züriputsch of 1839 , civil war ( the Sonderbundskrieg ) broke out in 1847 when some Catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance ( the Sonderbund ) . The war lasted for less than a month , causing fewer than 100 casualties , most of which were through friendly fire . Yet however minor the Sonderbundskrieg appears compared with other European riots and wars in the 19th century , it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the Swiss and of Switzerland .
In response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players , in 1999 , the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union . A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive 'A ' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years , and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years . If a player does not meet those criteria , the club wishing to sign him may appeal .
The rising population has resulted in an increased demand on fish stocks , which are under stress ; although the creation of the Funafuti Conservation Area has provided a fishing exclusion area to help sustain the fish population across the Funafuti lagoon . Population pressure on the resources of Funafuti and inadequate sanitation systems have resulted in pollution . The Waste Operations and Services Act of 2009 provides the legal framework for waste management and pollution control projects funded by the European Union directed at organic waste composting in eco-sanitation systems . The Environment Protection ( Litter and Waste Control ) Regulation 2013 is intended to improve the management of the importation of non-biodegradable materials . In Tuvalu plastic waste is a problem as much imported food and other commodities are supplied in plastic containers or packaging .
On Thursday , September 15 , 2011 , more than 500 people from Hongxiao Village protested over the large-scale death of fish in a nearby river . Angry protesters stormed the Zhejiang Jinko Solar Company factory compound , overturned eight company vehicles , and destroyed the offices before police came to disperse the crowd . Protests continued on the two following nights with reports of scuffles , officials said . Chen Hongming , a deputy head of Haining 's environmental protection bureau , said the factory 's waste disposal had failed pollution tests since April . The environmental watchdog had warned the factory , but it had not effectively controlled the pollution , Chen added .
After the setback at Aspern-Essling , Napoleon took more than six weeks in planning and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt at crossing the Danube . From 30 June to the early days of July , the French recrossed the Danube in strength , with more than 180,000 troops marching across the Marchfeld towards the Austrians . Charles received the French with 150,000 of his own men . In the ensuing Battle of Wagram , which also lasted two days , Napoleon commanded his forces in what was the largest battle of his career up until then . Neither side made much progress on 5 July , but the 6th produced a definitive outcome . Both sides launched major assaults on their flanks . Austrian attacks against the French left wing looked dangerous initially , but they were all beaten back . Meanwhile , a steady French attack against the Austrian left wing eventually compromised the entire position for Charles . Napoleon finished off the battle with a concentrated central thrust that punctured a hole in the Austrian army and forced Charles to retreat . Austrian losses were very heavy , reaching well over 40,000 casualties . The French were too exhausted to pursue the Austrians immediately , but Napoleon eventually caught up with Charles at Znaim and the latter signed an armistice on 12 July .
On the Indian subcontinent , the Mughal Empire ruled most of India in the early 18th century . The " classic period " ended with the death and defeat of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707 by the rising Hindu Maratha Empire , although the dynasty continued for another 150 years . During this period , the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions . All the significant monuments of the Mughals , their most visible legacy , date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent , with brilliant literary , artistic , and architectural results . The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the Peshwas , the prime ministers of the Maratha empire . In 1761 , the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states .
Most wrestling matches last for a set number of falls , with the first side to achieve the majority number of pinfalls , submissions , or countouts being the winner . Historically , matches were wrestled to 3 falls ( " best 2 out of 3 " ) or 5 falls ( " best 3 out of 5 " ) . The standard for modern matches is one fall . However , even though it is now standard , many announcers will explicitly state this ( e.g . " The following contest is set for one fall with a 20-minute time limit " ) . These matches are given a time limit ; if not enough falls are scored by the end of the time limit , the match is declared a draw . Modern matches are generally given a 10- to 30-minute time limit for standard matches ; title matches can go for up to one hour . British wrestling matches held under Admiral-Lord Mountevans rules are 2 out of 3 falls .
A red dye called Kermes was made beginning in the Neolithic Period by drying and then crushing the bodies of the females of a tiny scale insect in the genus Kermes , primarily Kermes vermilio . The insects live on the sap of certain trees , especially Kermes oak trees near the Mediterranean region . Jars of kermes have been found in a Neolithic cave-burial at Adaoutse , Bouches-du-Rhône . Kermes from oak trees was later used by Romans , who imported it from Spain . A different variety of dye was made from Porphyrophora hamelii ( Armenian cochineal ) scale insects that lived on the roots and stems of certain herbs . It was mentioned in texts as early as the 8th century BC , and it was used by the ancient Assyrians and Persians .
The final decades of the 20th century have seen the rise of a new interdisciplinary approach to studying human psychology , known collectively as cognitive science . Cognitive science again considers the mind as a subject for investigation , using the tools of psychology , linguistics , computer science , philosophy , and neurobiology . New methods of visualizing the activity of the brain , such as PET scans and CAT scans , began to exert their influence as well , leading some researchers to investigate the mind by investigating the brain , rather than cognition . These new forms of investigation assume that a wide understanding of the human mind is possible , and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains , such as artificial intelligence .
It is the third language of South Africa in terms of native speakers ( ~13.5 % ) , of whom 53 percent are Coloureds and 42.4 percent Whites . In 1996 , 40 percent of South Africans reported to know Afrikaans at least at a very basic level of communication . It is the lingua franca in Namibia , where it is spoken natively in 11 percent of households . In total , Afrikaans is the first language in South Africa alone of about 6.8 million people and is estimated to be a second language for at least 10 million people worldwide , compared to over 23 million and 5 million respectively , for Dutch .
Rapid decompression can be much more dangerous than vacuum exposure itself . Even if the victim does not hold his or her breath , venting through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the fatal rupture of the delicate alveoli of the lungs . Eardrums and sinuses may be ruptured by rapid decompression , soft tissues may bruise and seep blood , and the stress of shock will accelerate oxygen consumption leading to hypoxia . Injuries caused by rapid decompression are called barotrauma . A pressure drop of 13 kPa ( 100 Torr ) , which produces no symptoms if it is gradual , may be fatal if it occurs suddenly .
Almost 60 years later , 80 year old career criminal Henry ( Harry ) James Burge claimed to have committed the theft , confessing to a newspaper , with the story being published in the Sunday Pictorial newspaper on 23 February 1958 . He claimed to have carried out the robbery with two other men , although when discrepancies with a contemporaneous report in the Birmingham Post newspaper ( the crime pre-dated written police reports ) in his account of the means of entry and other items stolen , detectives decided there was no realistic possibility of a conviction and the case was closed . Burge claimed the cup had been melted down to make counterfeit half-crown coins , which matched known intelligence of the time , in which stolen silver was being used to forge coins which were then laundered through betting shops at a local racecourse , although Burge had no past history of forgery in a record of 42 previous convictions for which he had spent 42 years in prison . He had been further imprisoned in 1957 for seven years for theft from cars . Released in 1961 , he died in 1964 .
Plymouth is the regional television centre of BBC South West . A team of journalists are headquartered at Plymouth for the ITV West Country regional station , after a merger with ITV West forced ITV Westcountry to close on 16 February 2009 . The main local newspapers serving Plymouth are The Herald and Western Morning News with Radio Plymouth , BBC Radio Devon , Heart South West , and Pirate FM being the main local radio stations .
Most Venezuelans have some indigenous heritage , but the indigenous population make up only around 2 % of the total population . They speak around 29 different languages and many more dialects , but some of the ethnic groups are very small and their languages are in danger of becoming extinct in the next decades . The most important indigenous groups are the Ye'kuana , the Wayuu , the Pemon and the Warao . The most advanced native people to have lived in present-day Venezuela is thought to have been the Timoto-cuicas , who mainly lived in the Venezuelan Andes . In total it is estimated that there were between 350 thousand and 500 thousand inhabitants , the most densely populated area being the Andean region ( Timoto-cuicas ) , thanks to the advanced agricultural techniques used .
Gautama first went to study with famous religious teachers of the day , and mastered the meditative attainments they taught . But he found that they did not provide a permanent end to suffering , so he continued his quest . He next attempted an extreme asceticism , which was a religious pursuit common among the śramaṇas , a religious culture distinct from the Vedic one . Gautama underwent prolonged fasting , breath-holding , and exposure to pain . He almost starved himself to death in the process . He realized that he had taken this kind of practice to its limit , and had not put an end to suffering . So in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach . He devoted himself to anapanasati meditation , through which he discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way ( Skt . madhyamā-pratipad ) : a path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification .

The slowing sales growth has been attributed to the maturing PC market , which constituted 66 % of Dell 's sales , and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage , services and servers . Dell 's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs , but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company 's supply chain , and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell , weakening Dell 's traditional price differentiation . Throughout the entire PC industry , declines in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers ( a lucrative strategy of encouraging buyers to upgrade the processor or memory ) . As a result , the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before , which eroded profit margins . The laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the PC market , but Dell produced low-cost notebooks in China like other PC manufacturers which eliminated Dell 's manufacturing cost advantages , plus Dell 's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores . CNET has suggested that Dell was getting trapped in the increasing commoditization of high volume low margin computers , which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded .
The main party leaders , David Cameron , Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband , were all depicted holding a copy of the special issue in publicity material . Miliband 's decision to pose with a copy of The Sun received a strong response . Organisations representing the relatives of Hillsborough victims described Miliband 's action as an " absolute disgrace " and he faced criticism too from Liverpool Labour MPs and the city 's Labour Mayor , Joe Anderson . A statement was issued on 13 June explaining that Miliband " was promoting England 's bid to win the World Cup " , although " he understands the anger that is felt towards the Sun over Hillsborough by many people in Merseyside and he is sorry to those who feel offended . "
The Late Triassic spans from 237 million to 200 million years ago . Following the bloom of the Middle Triassic , the Late Triassic featured frequent heat spells , as well as moderate precipitation ( 10-20 inches per year ) . The recent warming led to a boom of reptilian evolution on land as the first true dinosaurs evolve , as well as pterosaurs . All this climatic change , however , resulted in a large die-out known as the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event , in which all archosaurs ( excluding ancient crocodiles ) , most synapsids , and almost all large amphibians went extinct , as well as 34 % of marine life in the fourth mass extinction event of the world . The cause is debatable .
Hidalgo is hailed as the Father of the Nation even though it was Agustin de Iturbide and not Hidalgo who achieved Mexican Independence in 1821 . Shortly after gaining independence , the day to celebrate it varied between September 16 , the day of Hidalgo 's Grito , and September 27 , the day Iturbide rode into Mexico City to end the war . Later , political movements would favor the more liberal Hidalgo over the conservative Iturbide , so that eventually September 16 , 1810 became the officially recognized day of Mexican independence . The reason for this is that Hidalgo is considered to be " precursor and creator of the rest of the heroes of the ( Mexican War of ) Independence . " Hidalgo has become an icon for Mexicans who resist tyranny in the country . Diego Rivera painted Hidalgo 's image in half a dozen murals . José Clemente Orozco depicted him with a flaming torch of liberty and considered the painting among his best work . David Alfaro Siqueiros was commissioned by San Nicolas University in Morelia to paint a mural for a celebration commemorating the 200th anniversary of Hidalgo 's birth . The town of his parish was renamed Dolores Hidalgo in his honor and the state of Hidalgo was created in 1869 . Every year on the night of 15–16 September , the president of Mexico re-enacts the Grito from the balcony of the National Palace . This scene is repeated by the heads of cities and towns all over Mexico . The remains of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla lie in the column of the Angel of Independence in Mexico City . Next to it is a lamp lit to represent the sacrifice of those who gave their lives for Mexican Independence .
The term samurai originally meant " those who serve in close attendance to nobility " , and was written with a Chinese character ( or kanji ) that had the same meaning . In Japanese , it was originally recorded in the Nara Period as a verb *samorapu ( " to watch , to keep watch , to observe , to be on the lookout for something ; to serve , to attend " ) , which is believed to be derived from the frequentative form ( *morapu 守らふ ) of the verb moru ( 守る , " to watch , to guard , to be on the lookout ; to keep , to protect , to take care of , to be in charge of , to have as one 's ward " ) . By the Heian period , this word had developed into the verb saburahu ( さぶらふ , " to serve , to attend " ) , from which a deverbal noun saburahi ( さぶらひ , " servant , attendant " ) was later derived , and this noun then yielded samurahi ( さむらひ ) in the Edo period . In Japanese literature , there is an early reference to samurai in the Kokinshū ( 古今集 , early 10th century ) :
St. Patrick 's Street , the main street of the city which was remodelled in the mid-2000s , is known for the architecture of the buildings along its pedestrian-friendly route and is the main shopping thoroughfare . The reason for its curved shape is that it originally was a channel of the River Lee that was built over on arches . The General Post Office , with its limestone façade , is on Oliver Plunkett Street , on the site of the Theatre Royal which was built in 1760 and burned down in 1840 . The English circus proprietor Pablo Fanque rebuilt an amphitheatre on the spot in 1850 , which was subsequently transformed into a theatre and then into the present General Post Office in 1877 . The Grand Parade is a tree-lined avenue , home to offices , shops and financial institutions . The old financial centre is the South Mall , with several banks whose interior derive from the 19th century , such as the Allied Irish Bank 's which was once an exchange .
Integral to the story of the origin of the name " Antarctica " is how it was not named Terra Australis—this name was given to Australia instead , and it was because of a mistake made by people who decided that a significant landmass would not be found farther south than Australia . Explorer Matthew Flinders , in particular , has been credited with popularizing the transfer of the name Terra Australis to Australia . He justified the titling of his book A Voyage to Terra Australis ( 1814 ) by writing in the introduction :
While Old Czech had a basic alphabet from which a general set of orthographical correspondences was drawn , it did not have a standard orthography . It also contained a number of sound clusters which no longer exist ; allowing ě ( /jɛ/ ) after soft consonants , which has since shifted to e ( /ɛ/ ) , and allowing complex consonant clusters to be pronounced all at once rather than syllabically . A phonological phenomenon , Havlik 's law ( which began in Proto-Slavic and took various forms in other Slavic languages ) , appeared in Old Czech ; counting backwards from the end of a clause , every odd-numbered yer was vocalized as a vowel , while the other yers disappeared .
Studies of nutritional status must take into account the state of the body before and after experiments , as well as the chemical composition of the whole diet and of all material excreted and eliminated from the body ( in urine and feces ) . Comparing the food to the waste can help determine the specific compounds and elements absorbed and metabolized in the body . The effects of nutrients may only be discernible over an extended period , during which all food and waste must be analyzed . The number of variables involved in such experiments is high , making nutritional studies time-consuming and expensive , which explains why the science of animal nutrition is still slowly evolving .
In European history , the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : Antiquity , Medieval period , and Modern period . The Medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , the High , and the Late Middle Ages .
It is widely assumed that architectural success was the product of a process of trial and error , with progressively less trial and more replication as the results of the process proved increasingly satisfactory . What is termed vernacular architecture continues to be produced in many parts of the world . Indeed , vernacular buildings make up most of the built world that people experience every day . Early human settlements were mostly rural . Due to a surplus in production the economy began to expand resulting in urbanization thus creating urban areas which grew and evolved very rapidly in some cases , such as that of Çatal Höyük in Anatolia and Mohenjo Daro of the Indus Valley Civilization in modern-day Pakistan .
In 2002 , IBM acquired PwC consulting . In 2003 it initiated a project to redefine company values . Using its Jam technology , it hosted a three-day Internet-based online discussion of key business issues with 50,000 employees . Results were data mined with sophisticated text analysis software ( eClassifier ) for common themes . Three emerged , expressed as : " Dedication to every client 's success " , " Innovation that matters—for our company and for the world " , and " Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships " . Another three-day Jam took place in 2004 , with 52,000 employees discussing ways to implement company values in practice .
In the classical music domain , Portugal is represented by names as the pianists Artur Pizarro , Maria João Pires , Sequeira Costa , the violinists Carlos Damas , Gerardo Ribeiro and in the past by the great cellist Guilhermina Suggia . Notable composers include José Vianna da Motta , Carlos Seixas , João Domingos Bomtempo , João de Sousa Carvalho , Luís de Freitas Branco and his student Joly Braga Santos , Fernando Lopes-Graça , Emmanuel Nunes and Sérgio Azevedo . Similarly , contemporary composers such as Nuno Malo and Miguel d'Oliveira have achieved some international success writing original music for film and television .
By mid-November 1940 , when the Germans adopted a changed plan , more than 13,000 short tons ( 12,000 t ) of high explosive and nearly 1,000,000 incendiaries had fallen on London . Outside the capital , there had been widespread harassing activity by single aircraft , as well as fairly strong diversionary attacks on Birmingham , Coventry and Liverpool , but no major raids . The London docks and railways communications had taken a heavy pounding , and much damage had been done to the railway system outside . In September , there had been no less than 667 hits on railways in Great Britain , and at one period , between 5,000 and 6,000 wagons were standing idle from the effect of delayed action bombs . But the great bulk of the traffic went on ; and Londoners—though they glanced apprehensively each morning at the list of closed stretches of line displayed at their local station , or made strange detours round back streets in the buses—still got to work . For all the destruction of life and property , the observers sent out by the Ministry of Home Security failed to discover the slightest sign of a break in morale . More than 13,000 civilians had been killed , and almost 20,000 injured , in September and October alone , but the death toll was much less than expected . In late 1940 , Churchill credited the shelters :
In Dutch itself , Diets went out of common use - although Platdiets is still used for the transitional Limburgish-Ripuarian dialects in the north-east of Belgium . Nederlands , the official Dutch word for " Dutch " , did not become firmly established until the 19th century . This designation had been in use as far back as the end of the 15th century , but received competition from the more popular terminology Nederduits , " Low Dutch " , for several reasons . One of them was it reflected a distinction with Hoogduits , " High Dutch " , meaning the language spoken in Germany . The Hoog was later dropped , and thus , Duits narrowed down in meaning to refer to the German language .
1 STOBAR carrier : Admiral Flota Sovetskovo Soyuza Kuznetsov : 55,000 tonne Admiral Kuznetsov-class STOBAR aircraft carrier . Launched in 1985 as Tbilisi , renamed and operational from 1995 . Without catapults she can launch and recover lightly fueled naval fighters for air defense or anti-ship missions but not heavy conventional bombing strikes . [ citation needed ] Officially designated an aircraft carrying cruiser , she is unique in carrying a heavy cruiser 's complement of defensive weapons and large P-700 Granit offensive missiles . The P-700 systems will be removed in the coming refit to enlarge her below decks aviation facilities as well as upgrading her defensive systems .
In 1838 the situation was slightly the same as in 1831 . Muhammad Ali of Egypt was not happy about lack of his control and power in Syria , he resumed military actions . The Ottoman army lost to Egyptians at the Battle of Nezib on June 24 , 1839 . The Ottoman Empire was saved by Great Britain , Austria , Prussia and Russia by signing a convention in London in July 15 , 1840 to grant Muhammad Ali and his descendants the right to inherit power in Egypt in exchange for removal of Egyptian military forces from Syria and Lebanon . Moreover , Muhammad Ali had to admit a formal dependence from the Ottoman sultan . After Muhammad Ali refused to obey the requirements of the London convention , the allied Anglo-Austrian fleet blocked the Delta , bombarded Beirut and captured Acre . Muhammad Ali accepted the conditions of the London convention in 1840 .
By 1 October 1950 , the UN Command repelled the KPA northwards past the 38th parallel ; the ROK Army crossed after them , into North Korea . MacArthur made a statement demanding the KPA 's unconditional surrender . Six days later , on 7 October , with UN authorization , the UN Command forces followed the ROK forces northwards . The X Corps landed at Wonsan ( in southeastern North Korea ) and Riwon ( in northeastern North Korea ) , already captured by ROK forces . The Eighth U.S. Army and the ROK Army drove up western Korea and captured Pyongyang city , the North Korean capital , on 19 October 1950 . The 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team ( " Rakkasans " ) made their first of two combat jumps during the Korean War on 20 October 1950 at Sunchon and Sukchon . The missions of the 187th were to cut the road north going to China , preventing North Korean leaders from escaping from Pyongyang ; and to rescue American prisoners of war . At month 's end , UN forces held 135,000 KPA prisoners of war . As they neared the Sino-Korean border , the UN forces in the west were divided from those in the east by 50–100 miles of mountainous terrain .
Hong Kong : The event was held in Hong Kong on May 2 . In the ceremony held at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui , Chief Executive Donald Tsang handed the torch to the first torchbearer , Olympic medalist Lee Lai Shan . The torch relay then traveled through Nathan Road , Lantau Link , Sha Tin ( crossed Shing Mun River via a dragon boat , which had been never used before in the history of Olympic torch relays ) , Victoria Harbour ( crossed by Tin Hau , a VIP vessel managed by the Marine Department ) before ending in Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai . A total of 120 torchbearers were selected to participate in the event consisting of celebrities , athletes and pro-Beijing camp politicians . No politicians from the pro-democracy camp were selected as torchbearers . One torchbearer could not participate due to flight delay . It was estimated that more than 200,000 spectators came out and watched the relay . Many enthusiastic supporters wore red shirts and waved large Chinese flags . According to Hong Kong Chief Secretary for Administration Henry Tang , 3,000 police were deployed to ensure order .
In February 20 , 1988 , after a week of growing demonstrations in Stepanakert , capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast ( the Armenian majority area within Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic ) , the Regional Soviet voted to secede and join with the Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia . This local vote in a small , remote part of the Soviet Union made headlines around the world ; it was an unprecedented defiance of republic and national authorities . On February 22 , 1988 , in what became known as the " Askeran clash " , two Azerbaijanis were killed by Karabakh police . These deaths , announced on state radio , led to the Sumgait Pogrom . Between February 26 and March 1 , the city of Sumgait ( Azerbaijan ) saw violent anti-Armenian rioting during which 32 people were killed . The authorities totally lost control and occupied the city with paratroopers and tanks ; nearly all of the 14,000 Armenian residents of Sumgait fled .
According to Forbes magazine , Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy Corporation , Chesapeake Energy Corporation , and SandRidge Energy Corporation are the largest private oil-related companies in the nation , and all of Oklahoma 's Fortune 500 companies are energy-related . Tulsa 's ONEOK and Williams Companies are the state 's largest and second-largest companies respectively , also ranking as the nation 's second and third-largest companies in the field of energy , according to Fortune magazine . The magazine also placed Devon Energy as the second-largest company in the mining and crude oil-producing industry in the nation , while Chesapeake Energy ranks seventh respectively in that sector and Oklahoma Gas & Electric ranks as the 25th-largest gas and electric utility company .
Despite the position of the official organizations , an opinion poll carried out between 2001 and 2004 showed that the majority of the Valencian people consider Valencian different from Catalan . This position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly . Furthermore , the data indicates that younger generations educated in Valencian are much less likely to hold these views . A minority of Valencian scholars active in fields other than linguistics defends the position of the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture ( Acadèmia de Cultura Valenciana , RACV ) , which uses for Valencian a standard independent from Catalan .
I Love New York ( stylized I ❤ NY ) is both a logo and a song that are the basis of an advertising campaign and have been used since 1977 to promote tourism in New York City , and later to promote New York State as well . The trademarked logo , owned by New York State Empire State Development , appears in souvenir shops and brochures throughout the city and state , some licensed , many not . The song is the state song of New York .
Some bacteria produce intracellular nutrient storage granules for later use , such as glycogen , polyphosphate , sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates . Certain bacterial species , such as the photosynthetic Cyanobacteria , produce internal gas vesicles , which they use to regulate their buoyancy – allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels . Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria . Used primarily for photosynthesis , they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids . An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes , but these were later shown to be artifacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy . Inclusions are considered to be nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes . The most common inclusions are glycogen , lipid droplets , crystals , and pigments . Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate . These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect ; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or toluidine blue . Gas vacuoles , which are freely permeable to gas , are membrane-bound vesicles present in some species of Cyanobacteria . They allow the bacteria to control their buoyancy . Microcompartments are widespread , membrane-bound organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes . Carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments that contain enzymes involved in carbon fixation . Magnetosomes are bacterial microcompartments , present in magnetotactic bacteria , that contain magnetic crystals .
Additionally , Somalia has several private television networks , including Horn Cable Television and Universal TV . Two such TV stations re-broadcast Al-Jazeera and CNN . Eastern Television Network and SBC TV air from Bosaso , the commercial capital of Puntland . The Puntland and Somaliland regions also each have one government-run TV channel , Puntland TV and Radio and Somaliland National TV , respectively .
The iPod has also been credited with accelerating shifts within the music industry . The iPod 's popularization of digital music storage allows users to abandon listening to entire albums and instead be able to choose specific singles which hastened the end of the Album Era in popular music .
The rulers of the expansionist Qin dynasty , based in present-day Gansu and Shaanxi , were only the first strategists to realize that the area 's military importance matched its commercial and agricultural significance . The Sichuan basin is surrounded by the Himalayas to the west , the Qin Mountains to the north , and mountainous areas of Yunnan to the south . Since the Yangtze flows through the basin and then through the perilous Yangzi Gorges to eastern and southern China , Sichuan was a staging area for amphibious military forces and a refuge for political refugees .

Several Americans , especially Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson , played a major role in bringing Enlightenment ideas to the New World and in influencing British and French thinkers . Franklin was influential for his political activism and for his advances in physics . The cultural exchange during the Age of Enlightenment ran in both directions across the Atlantic . Thinkers such as Paine , Locke , and Rousseau all take Native American cultural practices as examples of natural freedom . The Americans closely followed English and Scottish political ideas , as well as some French thinkers such as Montesquieu . As deists , they were influenced by ideas of John Toland ( 1670–1722 ) and Matthew Tindal ( 1656–1733 ) . During the Enlightenment there was a great emphasis upon liberty , democracy , republicanism and religious tolerance . Attempts to reconcile science and religion resulted in a widespread rejection of prophecy , miracle and revealed religion in preference for Deism – especially by Thomas Paine in The Age of Reason and by Thomas Jefferson in his short Jefferson Bible – from which all supernatural aspects were removed .
During the period from 2000–2005 it is estimated that 49,722 people left the state for the United States . Some 82,000 people are thought to have immigrated to the state from 2000–2005 mainly coming from Veracruz ( 17.6 % ) , United States ( 16.2 % ) , Durango ( 13.2 % ) , Coahuila ( 8.0 % ) and Chiapas ( 4.5 % ) . It is believed that there is a large number of undocumented immigrants in that state the come from Central and South America which mainly settle in Ciudad Juárez . According to the 2005 census , the population grew 1.06 % from 2000 to 2005 . The state has an uneven settlement of people and the lowest population density of any Mexican state ; according to the 2005 census there were 12 people per km2 . Of all the 3,241,444 people in the state , two-thirds ( 2,072,129 ) live in the cities of Ciudad Juárez and Chihuahua . Only three other cities have populations over 100,000 : Parral 101,147 , Cuauhtémoc 105,725 , and Delicias 108,187 .
The site of Richmond had been an important village of the Powhatan Confederacy , and was briefly settled by English colonists from Jamestown in 1609 , and in 1610–1611 . The present city of Richmond was founded in 1737 . It became the capital of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia in 1780 . During the Revolutionary War period , several notable events occurred in the city , including Patrick Henry 's " Give me liberty or give me death " speech in 1775 at St. John 's Church , and the passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom written by Thomas Jefferson . During the American Civil War , Richmond served as the capital of the Confederate States of America . The city entered the 20th century with one of the world 's first successful electric streetcar systems , as well as a national hub of African-American commerce and culture , the Jackson Ward neighborhood .
GE is a multinational conglomerate headquartered in Fairfield , Connecticut . Its main offices are located at 30 Rockefeller Plaza at Rockefeller Center in New York City , known now as the Comcast Building . It was formerly known as the GE Building for the prominent GE logo on the roof ; NBC 's headquarters and main studios are also located in the building . Through its RCA subsidiary , it has been associated with the center since its construction in the 1930s . GE moved its corporate headquarters from the GE Building on Lexington Avenue to Fairfield in 1974 .
Philadelphia 's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for America 's revolutionaries . By the 1750s , Philadelphia had surpassed Boston to become the largest city and busiest port in British America , and second in the British Empire , behind London . The city hosted the First Continental Congress before the American Revolutionary War ; the Second Continental Congress , which signed the United States Declaration of Independence , during the war ; and the Constitutional Convention ( 1787 ) after the war . Several battles were fought in and near Philadelphia as well .
In 1976 , contemporaneously with Woodson and Roberts , the Court decided Gregg v. Georgia and upheld a procedure in which the trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases . At the first proceeding , the jury decides the defendant 's guilt ; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first-degree murder , the death penalty will not be imposed . At the second hearing , the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist , whether any mitigating factors exist , and , in many jurisdictions , weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty – either death or life in prison , either with or without parole .
Burdened with debt , in 2004 Vivendi Universal sold 80 % of Vivendi Universal Entertainment ( including the studio and theme parks ) to General Electric , parent of NBC . The resulting media super-conglomerate was renamed NBCUniversal , while Universal Studios Inc. remained the name of the production subsidiary . After that deal , GE owned 80 % of NBC Universal ; Vivendi held the remaining 20 % , with an option to sell its share in 2006 . GE purchased Vivendi 's share in NBCU in 2011 and in turn sold 51 % of the company to cable provider Comcast . Comcast merged the former GE subsidiary with its own cable-television programming assets , creating the current NBCUniversal . Following Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) approval , the Comcast-GE deal was closed on Jan 29 , 2011 . In March 2013 , Comcast bought the remaining 49 % of NBCUniversal for $ 16.7 billion .
In the months before the attack on Pearl Harbor , Kwajalein Atoll was the administrative center of the Japanese 6th Fleet Forces Service , whose task was the defense of the Marshall Islands .
The original services of an inn are now also available at other establishments , such as hotels , lodges , and motels , which focus more on lodging customers than on other services , although they usually provide meals ; pubs , which are primarily alcohol-serving establishments ; and restaurants and taverns , which serve food and drink . In North America , the lodging aspect of the word " inn " lives on in hotel brand names like Holiday Inn , and in some state laws that refer to lodging operators as innkeepers .
Kadamba ( 345 – 525 CE ) was an ancient royal dynasty of Karnataka , India that ruled northern Karnataka and the Konkan from Banavasi in present-day Uttara Kannada district . At the peak of their power under King Kakushtavarma , the Kadambas of Banavasi ruled large parts of modern Karnataka state . The dynasty was founded by Mayurasharma in 345 CE which at later times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions , an indication to which is provided by the titles and epithets assumed by its rulers . King Mayurasharma defeated the armies of Pallavas of Kanchi possibly with help of some native tribes . The Kadamba fame reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma , a notable ruler with whom even the kings of Gupta Dynasty of northern India cultivated marital alliances . The Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with absolute autonomy . The dynasty later continued to rule as a feudatory of larger Kannada empires , the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires , for over five hundred years during which time they branched into minor dynasties known as the Kadambas of Goa , Kadambas of Halasi and Kadambas of Hangal .
Meanwhile , the Tumed Mongols began moving into the Kokonor region ( modern Qinghai ) , raiding the Ming Chinese frontier and even as far as the suburbs of Beijing under Altan Khan ( 1507–1582 ) . Klieger writes that Altan Khan 's presence in the west effectively reduced Ming influence and contact with Tibet . After Altan Khan made peace with the Ming dynasty in 1571 , he invited the third hierarch of the Gelug—Sönam Gyatso ( 1543–1588 ) —to meet him in Amdo ( modern Qinghai ) in 1578 , where he accidentally bestowed him and his two predecessors with the title of Dalai Lama— " Ocean Teacher " . The full title was " Dalai Lama Vajradhara " , " Vajradhara " meaning " Holder of the Thunderbolt " in Sanskrit . Victoria Huckenpahler notes that Vajradhara is considered by Buddhists to be the primordial Buddha of limitless and all-pervasive beneficial qualities , a being that " represents the ultimate aspect of enlightenment . " Goldstein writes that Sönam Gyatso also enhanced Altan Khan 's standing by granting him the title " king of religion , majestic purity " . Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama officially recognized Altan Khan as the " Protector of the Faith " .
In the early days of association football , known simply as football or soccer , friendly matches ( or " friendlies " ) were the most common type of match . However , since the development of The Football League in England in 1888 , league tournaments became established , in addition to lengthy derby and cup tournaments . By the year 2000 , national leagues were established in almost every country throughout the world , as well as local or regional leagues for lower level teams , thus the significance of friendlies has seriously declined since the 19th century .
By the mid-18th century , Charles Town had become a bustling trade center , the hub of the Atlantic trade for the southern colonies . Charles Towne was also the wealthiest and largest city south of Philadelphia , in part because of the lucrative slave trade . By 1770 , it was the fourth-largest port in the colonies , after Boston , New York , and Philadelphia , with a population of 11,000—slightly more than half of them slaves . By 1708 , the majority of the colony 's population was slaves , and the future state would continue to be a majority of African descent until after the Great Migration of the early 20th century .
Czech ( /ˈtʃɛk/ ; čeština Czech pronunciation : [ ˈt͡ʃɛʃcɪna ] ) , formerly known as Bohemian ( /boʊˈhiːmiən , bə-/ ; lingua Bohemica in Latin ) , is a West Slavic language strongly influenced by Latin and German language , spoken by over 10 million people and it is the official language of the Czech Republic . Czech 's closest relative is Slovak , with which it is mutually intelligible . It is closely related to other West Slavic languages , such as Silesian and Polish . Although most Czech vocabulary is based on shared roots with Slavic , Romance , and Germanic languages , many loanwords ( most associated with high culture ) have been adopted in recent years .
Because of his ability to motivate nationalistic passions , " men , women , and children wept and wailed in the streets " after hearing of his death , according to Nutting . The general Arab reaction was one of mourning , with thousands of people pouring onto the streets of major cities throughout the Arab world . Over a dozen people were killed in Beirut as a result of the chaos , and in Jerusalem , roughly 75,000 Arabs marched through the Old City chanting , " Nasser will never die . " As a testament to his unchallenged leadership of the Arab people , following his death , the headline of the Lebanese Le Jour read , " One hundred million human beings—the Arabs—are orphans . " Sherif Hetata , a former political prisoner and later member Nasser 's ASU , said that " Nasser 's greatest achievement was his funeral . The world will never again see five million people crying together . "
In January 1938 , Milt Gabler started recording for his new label , Commodore Records , and to allow for longer continuous performances , he recorded some 12-inch records . Eddie Condon explained : " Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development . " The first two 12-inch recordings did not take advantage of the extra length : " Carnegie Drag " was 3:15 ; " Carnegie Jump " , 2:41 . But at the second session , on April 30 , the two 12-inch recordings were longer : " Embraceable You " was 4:05 ; " Serenade to a Shylock " , 4:32 . Another way around the time limitation was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record . Vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded " Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean " , written by Irving and Jack Kaufman , as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Cameo . An obvious workaround for longer recordings was to release a set of records . An early multi-record release was in 1903 , when HMV in England made the first complete recording of an opera , Verdi 's Ernani , on 40 single-sided discs . In 1940 , Commodore released Eddie Condon and his Band 's recording of " A Good Man Is Hard to Find " in four parts , issued on both sides of two 12-inch 78s . This limitation on the duration of recordings persisted from 1910 until the invention of the LP record , in 1948 . In popular music , this time limitation of about 3:30 on a 10-inch 78 rpm record meant that singers usually did not release long pieces on record . One exception is Frank Sinatra 's recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein 's " Soliloquy " , from Carousel , made on May 28 , 1946 . Because it ran 7:57 , longer than both sides of a standard 78 rpm 10-inch record , it was released on Columbia 's Masterwork label ( the classical division ) as two sides of a 12-inch record . The same was true of John Raitt 's performance of the song on the original cast album of Carousel , which had been issued on a 78-rpm album set by American Decca in 1945 .
Madonna 's look and style of dressing , her performances , and her music videos influenced young girls and women . Her style became one of the female fashion trends of the 1980s . Created by stylist and jewelry designer Maripol , the look consisted of lace tops , skirts over capri pants , fishnet stockings , jewelry bearing the crucifix , bracelets , and bleached hair . Madonna achieved global recognition after the release of her second studio album , Like a Virgin , in November 1984 . It topped the charts in several countries and became her first number one album on the Billboard 200 . The title track , " Like a Virgin " , topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six consecutive weeks . It attracted the attention of organizations who complained that the song and its accompanying video promoted premarital sex and undermined family values , and moralists sought to have the song and video banned .
In 2001 , Comcast announced it would acquire the assets of the largest cable television operator at the time , AT & T Broadband , for US $ 44.5 billion . The proposed name for the merged company was " AT & T Comcast " , but the companies ultimately decided to keep only the Comcast name . In 2002 , Comcast acquired all assets of AT & T Broadband , thus making Comcast the largest cable television company in the United States with over 22 million subscribers . This also spurred the start of Comcast Advertising Sales ( using AT & T 's groundwork ) which would later be renamed Comcast Spotlight . As part of this acquisition , Comcast also acquired the National Digital Television Center in Centennial , Colorado as a wholly owned subsidiary , which is today known as the Comcast Media Center .
Birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes . Colourful birds , such as parrots and mynas , are bred in captivity or kept as pets , a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered species . Falcons and cormorants have long been used for hunting and fishing , respectively . Messenger pigeons , used since at least 1 AD , remained important as recently as World War II . Today , such activities are more common either as hobbies , for entertainment and tourism , or for sports such as pigeon racing .
Drying produces a decided increase in the strength of wood , particularly in small specimens . An extreme example is the case of a completely dry spruce block 5 cm in section , which will sustain a permanent load four times as great as a green ( undried ) block of the same size will .
Further work on MPEG audio was finalized in 1994 as part of the second suite of MPEG standards , MPEG-2 , more formally known as international standard ISO/IEC 13818-3 ( a.k.a . MPEG-2 Part 3 or backwards compatible MPEG-2 Audio or MPEG-2 Audio BC ) , originally published in 1995 . MPEG-2 Part 3 ( ISO/IEC 13818-3 ) defined additional bit rates and sample rates for MPEG-1 Audio Layer I , II and III . The new sampling rates are exactly half that of those originally defined in MPEG-1 Audio . This reduction in sampling rate serves to cut the available frequency fidelity in half while likewise cutting the bitrate by 50 % . MPEG-2 Part 3 also enhanced MPEG-1 's audio by allowing the coding of audio programs with more than two channels , up to 5.1 multichannel .
Sociological attention to emotion has varied over time . Emilé Durkheim ( 1915/1965 ) wrote about the collective effervescence or emotional energy that was experienced by members of totemic rituals in Australian aborigine society . He explained how the heightened state of emotional energy achieved during totemic rituals transported individuals above themselves giving them the sense that they were in the presence of a higher power , a force , that was embedded in the sacred objects that were worshipped . These feelings of exaltation , he argued , ultimately lead people to believe that there were forces that governed sacred objects .
Von Neumann 's results have been viewed as a special case of linear programming , where von Neumann 's model uses only nonnegative matrices . The study of von Neumann 's model of an expanding economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics . This paper has been called the greatest paper in mathematical economics by several authors , who recognized its introduction of fixed-point theorems , linear inequalities , complementary slackness , and saddlepoint duality . In the proceedings of a conference on von Neumann 's growth model , Paul Samuelson said that many mathematicians had developed methods useful to economists , but that von Neumann was unique in having made significant contributions to economic theory itself .
The Royal Navy is constructing two new larger STOVL aircraft carriers , the Queen Elizabeth class , to replace the three now retired Invincible-class carriers . The ships are HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales . They will be able to operate up to 40 aircraft on peace time operations with a tailored group of up to 50 , and will have a displacement of 70,600 tonnes . HMS Queen Elizabeth is projected to commission in 2017 followed by Prince of Wales in about 2020 . The ships are due to become operational starting in 2020 . Their primary aircraft complement will be made up of F-35B Lightning IIs , and their ship 's company will number around 680 with the total complement rising to about 1600 when the air group is embarked . The two ships will be the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy .
In 2010 , the literacy rate of Liberia was estimated at 60.8 % ( 64.8 % for males and 56.8 % for females ) . In some areas primary and secondary education is free and compulsory from the ages of 6 to 16 , though enforcement of attendance is lax . In other areas children are required to pay a tuition fee to attend school . On average , children attain 10 years of education ( 11 for boys and 8 for girls ) . The country 's education sector is hampered by inadequate schools and supplies , as well as a lack of qualified teachers .
Gautama first went to study with famous religious teachers of the day , and mastered the meditative attainments they taught . But he found that they did not provide a permanent end to suffering , so he continued his quest . He next attempted an extreme asceticism , which was a religious pursuit common among the śramaṇas , a religious culture distinct from the Vedic one . Gautama underwent prolonged fasting , breath-holding , and exposure to pain . He almost starved himself to death in the process . He realized that he had taken this kind of practice to its limit , and had not put an end to suffering . So in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach . He devoted himself to anapanasati meditation , through which he discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way ( Skt . madhyamā-pratipad ) : a path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification .

Peer groups are essential to social and general development . Communication with peers increases significantly during adolescence and peer relationships become more intense than in other stages and more influential to the teen , affecting both the decisions and choices being made . High quality friendships may enhance children 's development regardless of the characteristics of those friends . As children begin to bond with various people and create friendships , it later helps them when they are adolescent and sets up the framework for adolescence and peer groups . Peer groups are especially important during adolescence , a period of development characterized by a dramatic increase in time spent with peers and a decrease in adult supervision . Adolescents also associate with friends of the opposite sex much more than in childhood and tend to identify with larger groups of peers based on shared characteristics . It is also common for adolescents to use friends as coping devices in different situations . A three-factor structure of dealing with friends including avoidance , mastery , and nonchalance has shown that adolescents use friends as coping devices with social stresses .
The Uniform Crime Reports ( UCR ) compile data from over 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the country . They provide detailed data regarding the volume of crimes to include arrest , clearance ( or closing a case ) , and law enforcement officer information . The UCR focuses its data collection on violent crimes , hate crimes , and property crimes . Created in the 1920s , the UCR system has not proven to be as uniform as its name implies . The UCR data only reflect the most serious offense in the case of connected crimes and has a very restrictive definition of rape . Since about 93 % of the data submitted to the FBI is in this format , the UCR stands out as the publication of choice as most states require law enforcement agencies to submit this data .
After the decline of the Teutonic Order following its defeat in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 , and the defeat of the Livonian Order in the Battle of Swienta on 1 September 1435 , the Livonian Confederation Agreement was signed on 4 December 1435 . The Livonian Confederation ceased to exist during the Livonian War ( 1558–82 ) . The wars had reduced the Estonian population from about 250–300,000 people before the Livonian War to 120–140,000 in the 1620s . The Grand Duchy of Moscow and Tsardom of Russia also attempted invasions in 1481 and 1558 , both of which were unsuccessful .
Between the 1992–93 season and the 2012–13 season , Premier League clubs had won the UEFA Champions League four times ( as well as supplying five of the runners-up ) , behind Spain 's La Liga with six wins , and Italy 's Serie A with five wins , and ahead of , among others , Germany 's Bundesliga with three wins ( see table here ) . The FIFA Club World Cup ( or the FIFA Club World Championship , as it was originally called ) has been won by Premier league clubs once ( Manchester United in 2008 ) , and they have also been runners-up twice , behind Brazil 's Brasileirão with four wins , and Spain 's La Liga and Italy 's Serie A with two wins each ( see table here ) .
Insects are the only group of invertebrates to have developed flight . The evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate . Some entomologists suggest that the wings are from paranotal lobes , or extensions from the insect 's exoskeleton called the nota , called the paranotal theory . Other theories are based on a pleural origin . These theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills , spiracular flaps or as from an appendage of the epicoxa . The epicoxal theory suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites , a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa . In the Carboniferous age , some of the Meganeura dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm ( 20 in ) wide wingspan . The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen . The respiratory system of insects constrains their size , however the high oxygen in the atmosphere allowed larger sizes . The largest flying insects today are much smaller and include several moth species such as the Atlas moth and the White Witch ( Thysania agrippina ) .
The German Empire conquered Ukraine during World War I and was planning on either annexing it or installing a puppet king , but was defeated by the Entente , with major involvement by the Ukrainian Bolsheviks . After conquering the rest of Ukraine from the Whites , Ukraine joined the USSR and was enlarged ( gaining Crimea and then Eastern Galicia ) , whence a process of Ukrainization was begun , with encouragement from Moscow .
Jones comments that " Chopin 's unique position as a composer , despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano , has rarely been questioned . " He also notes that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in Paris in 1831— " the artistic environment , the publishers who were willing to print his music , the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what Chopin asked for their lessons " —and these factors , as well as his musical genius , also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation . While his illness and his love-affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of romanticism , the rarity of his public recitals ( as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soirées ) led Arthur Hutchings to suggest that " his lack of Byronic flamboyance [ and ] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional " among his romantic contemporaries , such as Liszt and Henri Herz .
Von Neumann was born Neumann János Lajos ( in Hungarian the family name comes first ) , Hebrew name Yonah , in Budapest , Kingdom of Hungary , which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , to wealthy Jewish parents of the Haskalah . He was the eldest of three children . He had two younger brothers : Michael , born in 1907 , and Nicholas , who was born in 1911 . His father , Neumann Miksa ( Max Neumann ) was a banker , who held a doctorate in law . He had moved to Budapest from Pécs at the end of the 1880s . Miksa 's father and grandfather were both born in Ond ( now part of the town of Szerencs ) , Zemplén County , northern Hungary . John 's mother was Kann Margit ( Margaret Kann ) ; her parents were Jakab Kann and Katalin Meisels . Three generations of the Kann family lived in spacious apartments above the Kann-Heller offices in Budapest ; von Neumann 's family occupied an 18-room apartment on the top floor .
The city slopes gently from the northwest to southeast on a till plain composed largely of glacial and lake clay . The most notable topographical feature in the city is the Detroit Moraine , a broad clay ridge on which the older portions of Detroit and Windsor sit atop , rising approximately 62 feet ( 19 m ) above the river at its highest point . The highest elevation in the city is located directly north of Gorham Playground on the northwest side approximately three blocks south of 8 Mile Road , at a height of 675 to 680 feet ( 206 to 207 m ) . Detroit 's lowest elevation is along the Detroit River , at a surface height of 572 feet ( 174 m ) .
Many television shows and films have been produced which portray in-character professional wrestlers as protagonists , such as Ready to Rumble , ¡Mucha Lucha ! , Nacho Libre , and the Santo film series . In the wildly popular Rocky series of films about the fictional boxer Rocky Balboa , Rocky III saw its hero fighting a " boxer vs. wrestler " exhibition match against the enormous and villainous wrestler " Thunderlips " , portrayed by real-life soon-to-be wrestling icon Hulk Hogan . At least two stage plays set in the world of pro wrestling have been produced : The Baron is a comedy that retells the life of an actual performer known as Baron von Raschke . From Parts Unknown ... is an award-nominated Canadian drama about the rise and fall of a fictional wrestler . The 2009 South Park episode " W.T.F . " played on the soap operatic elements of professional wrestling . One of the lead characters on the Disney Channel series Kim Possible was a huge fan of pro wrestling and actually featured it on an episode ( with two former WWE wrestlers voicing the two fictitious wrestlers featured in the episode ) . The 2008 film The Wrestler , about a washed-up professional wrestler , garnered several Oscar nominations .
In 1840 , St Helena became a provisioning station for the British West Africa Squadron , preventing slavery to Brazil ( mainly ) , and many thousands of slaves were freed on the island . These were all African , and about 500 stayed while the rest were sent on to the West Indies and Cape Town , and eventually to Sierra Leone .
Von Neumann is credited with the equilibrium strategy of mutual assured destruction , providing the deliberately humorous acronym , MAD . ( Other humorous acronyms coined by von Neumann include his computer , the Mathematical Analyzer , Numerical Integrator , and Computer—or MANIAC ) . He also " moved heaven and earth " to bring MAD about . His goal was to quickly develop ICBMs and the compact hydrogen bombs that they could deliver to the USSR , and he knew the Soviets were doing similar work because the CIA interviewed German rocket scientists who were allowed to return to Germany , and von Neumann had planted a dozen technical people in the CIA . The Russians believed that bombers would soon be vulnerable , and they shared von Neumann 's view that an H-bomb in an ICBM was the ne plus ultra of weapons , and they believed that whoever had superiority in these weapons would take over the world , without necessarily using them . He was afraid of a " missile gap " and took several more steps to achieve his goal of keeping up with the Soviets :
On 27 June , Rhee evacuated from Seoul with some of the government . On 28 June , at 2 am , the South Korean Army blew up the highway bridge across the Han River in an attempt to stop the North Korean army . The bridge was detonated while 4,000 refugees were crossing the bridge , and hundreds were killed . Destroying the bridge also trapped many South Korean military units north of the Han River . In spite of such desperate measures , Seoul fell that same day . A number of South Korean National Assemblymen remained in Seoul when it fell , and forty-eight subsequently pledged allegiance to the North .
Season six premiered with the series ' highest-rated debut episode and a few of its succeeding episodes rank among the most watched episodes of American Idol . During this time , many television executives begun to regard the show as a programming force unlike any seen before , as its consistent dominance of up to two hours two or three nights a week exceeded the 30- or 60-minute reach of previous hits such as NBC 's The Cosby Show . The show was dubbed " the Death Star " , and competing networks often rearranged their schedules in order to minimize losses . However , season six also showed a steady decline in viewership over the course of the season . The season finale saw a drop in ratings of 16 % from the previous year . Season six was the first season wherein the average results show rated higher than the competition stages ( unlike in the previous seasons ) , and became the second highest-rated of the series after the preceding season .
Currently , the rapid influx of northerners and immigrants from Latin America is steadily increasing ethnic and religious diversity : the number of Roman Catholics and Jews in the state has increased , as well as general religious diversity . The second-largest Protestant denomination in North Carolina after Baptist traditions is Methodism , which is strong in the northern Piedmont , especially in populous Guilford County . There are also a substantial number of Quakers in Guilford County and northeastern North Carolina . Many universities and colleges in the state have been founded on religious traditions , and some currently maintain that affiliation , including :
The city of Bern or Berne ( German : Bern , pronounced [ bɛrn ] ( listen ) ; French : Berne [ bɛʁn ] ; Italian : Berna [ ˈbɛrna ] ; Romansh : Berna [ ˈbɛrnɐ ] ( help·info ) ; Bernese German : Bärn [ b̥æːrn ] ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland , referred to by the Swiss as their ( e.g . in German ) Bundesstadt , or " federal city " . [ note 1 ] With a population of 140,634 ( November 2015 ) , Bern is the fifth most populous city in Switzerland . The Bern agglomeration , which includes 36 municipalities , had a population of 406,900 in 2014 . The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000 . Bern is also the capital of the Canton of Bern , the second most populous of Switzerland 's cantons .
Over the course of adolescence , the amount of white matter in the brain increases linearly , while the amount of grey matter in the brain follows an inverted-U pattern . Through a process called synaptic pruning , unnecessary neuronal connections in the brain are eliminated and the amount of grey matter is pared down . However , this does not mean that the brain loses functionality ; rather , it becomes more efficient due to increased myelination ( insulation of axons ) and the reduction of unused pathways .
Datta ( 2005 ) shows that , following the collapse of militaristic Boulangism in the late 1880s , the Napoleonic legend was divorced from party politics and revived in popular culture . Concentrating on two plays and two novels from the period—Victorien Sardou 's Madame Sans-Gêne ( 1893 ) , Maurice Barrès 's Les Déracinés ( 1897 ) , Edmond Rostand 's L'Aiglon ( 1900 ) , and André de Lorde and Gyp 's Napoléonette ( 1913 ) Datta examines how writers and critics of the Belle Époque exploited the Napoleonic legend for diverse political and cultural ends .
Subsequently , seven other chiefs on seven other islands signed a treaty in German and Marshallese and a final copy witnessed by Rötger on November 1 was sent to the German Foreign Office . The Germans erected a sign declaring a " Imperial German Protectorate " at Jaluit . It has been speculated that the crisis over the Carolines with Spain , which almost provoked a war , was in fact " a feint to cover the acquisition of the Marshall Islands " , which went almost unnoticed at the time , despite the islands being the largest source of copra in Micronesia . Spain sold the islands to Germany in 1884 through papal mediation .
In addition , the Paris region is served by a light rail network of nine lines , the tramway : Line T1 runs from Asnières-Gennevilliers to Noisy-le-Sec , line T2 runs from Pont de Bezons to Porte de Versailles , line T3a runs from Pont du Garigliano to Porte de Vincennes , line T3b runs from Porte de Vincennes to Porte de la Chapelle , line T5 runs from Saint-Denis to Garges-Sarcelles , line T6 runs from Châtillon to Velizy , line T7 runs from Villejuif to Athis-Mons , line T8 runs from Saint-Denis to Épinay-sur-Seine and Villetaneuse , all of which are operated by the Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens , and line T4 runs from Bondy RER to Aulnay-sous-Bois , which is operated by the state rail carrier SNCF . Five new light rail lines are currently in various stages of development .
Protein digestion occurs in the stomach and duodenum in which 3 main enzymes , pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin secreted by the pancreas , break down food proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids . The digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors , the zymogens . For example , trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen , which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin . Trypsin then cleaves proteins to smaller polypeptides .
Though traditionally a moderate newspaper and sometimes a supporter of the Conservative Party , it supported the Labour Party in the 2001 and 2005 general elections . In 2004 , according to MORI , the voting intentions of its readership were 40 % for the Conservative Party , 29 % for the Liberal Democrats , and 26 % for Labour . The Times had an average daily circulation of 394,448 in March 2014 ; in the same period , The Sunday Times had an average daily circulation of 839,077 . An American edition of The Times has been published since 6 June 2006 . It has been heavily used by scholars and researchers because of its widespread availability in libraries and its detailed index . A complete historical file of the digitized paper is online from Gage Cengage publisher .
The development of flattop vessels produced the first large fleet ships . In 1918 , HMS Argus became the world 's first carrier capable of launching and recovering naval aircraft . As a result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 , which limited the construction of new heavy surface combat ships , most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down ( or had served ) as different ship types : cargo ships , cruisers , battlecruisers , or battleships . These conversions gave rise to the Lexington-class aircraft carriers ( 1927 ) , Akagi and Courageous class . Specialist carrier evolution was well underway , with several navies ordering and building warships that were purposefully designed to function as aircraft carriers by the mid-1920s , resulting in the commissioning of ships such as Hōshō ( 1922 ) , HMS Hermes ( 1924 ) , and Béarn ( 1927 ) . During World War II , these ships would become known as fleet carriers . [ citation needed ]
The Canadian Rangers , who provide surveillance and patrol services in Canada 's arctic and other remote areas , are an essential reserve force component used for Canada 's exercise of sovereignty over its northern territory .
The increased consumption of reading materials of all sorts was one of the key features of the " social " Enlightenment . Developments in the Industrial Revolution allowed consumer goods to be produced in greater quantities at lower prices , encouraging the spread of books , pamphlets , newspapers and journals – " media of the transmission of ideas and attitudes " . Commercial development likewise increased the demand for information , along with rising populations and increased urbanisation . However , demand for reading material extended outside of the realm of the commercial , and outside the realm of the upper and middle classes , as evidenced by the Bibliothèque Bleue . Literacy rates are difficult to gauge , but in France at least , the rates doubled over the course of the 18th century . Reflecting the decreasing influence of religion , the number of books about science and art published in Paris doubled from 1720 to 1780 , while the number of books about religion dropped to just one-tenth of the total .
The birthplace of IBM , Endicott , suffered pollution for decades , however . IBM used liquid cleaning agents in circuit board assembly operation for more than two decades , and six spills and leaks were recorded , including one leak in 1979 of 4,100 gallons from an underground tank . These left behind volatile organic compounds in the town 's soil and aquifer . Traces of volatile organic compounds have been identified in Endicott’s drinking water , but the levels are within regulatory limits . Also , from 1980 , IBM has pumped out 78,000 gallons of chemicals , including trichloroethane , freon , benzene and perchloroethene to the air and allegedly caused several cancer cases among the townspeople . IBM Endicott has been identified by the Department of Environmental Conservation as the major source of pollution , though traces of contaminants from a local dry cleaner and other polluters were also found . Remediation and testing are ongoing , however according to city officials , tests show that the water is safe to drink .
AFL Global and Ganlan Media were created in 2012 by businessman Martin E. Judge , founder and owner of the Judge Group . The company , called AFL Global , LLC , looks to introduce and launch professional Arena Football teams and franchises in various locations throughout the world ( like NFL Europe ) . After their successful trip to China to help promote the game , they formally announced plans to further develop AFL China by the fall of 2014 by starting a comprehensive training program in May 2013 with exhibition games planned for the cities of Beijing and Guangzhou in October . This is the first time professional football of any kind will be played in China with the support of the Chinese government and the CRFA ( Chinese Rugby Football Association ) . Key persons involved include founder and CEO . Martin E. Judge , partner Ron Jaworski , CAFL CEO Gary Morris and president David Niu . Ganlan Media has since dropped this name and will carry the league 's name as its corporate identity .
On August 9 , 2015 , ESPN reported that the New Orleans VooDoo and Las Vegas Outlaws had ceased operations , effective immediately , a claim which was subsequently validated on the AFL website . On September 1 , 2015 , the Spokane Shock officially left the AFL and joined the IFL under the new name Spokane Empire , becoming the fifth active AFL/af2 franchise to leave for the IFL since bankruptcy ( Iowa Barnstormers , Tri-Cities Fever , Green Bay Blizzard and Arkansas Twisters—now the Texas Revolution—left previously ) .
The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis . This is in contrast to some other European Leagues , including La Liga , in which each club sells its rights individually , leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs . The money is divided into three parts : half is divided equally between the clubs ; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position , the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club , and equal steps all the way down the table ; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television , with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this . The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs .
Houston is the seat of the internationally renowned Texas Medical Center , which contains the world 's largest concentration of research and healthcare institutions . All 49 member institutions of the Texas Medical Center are non-profit organizations . They provide patient and preventive care , research , education , and local , national , and international community well-being . Employing more than 73,600 people , institutions at the medical center include 13 hospitals and two specialty institutions , two medical schools , four nursing schools , and schools of dentistry , public health , pharmacy , and virtually all health-related careers . It is where one of the first—and still the largest—air emergency service , Life Flight , was created , and a very successful inter-institutional transplant program was developed . More heart surgeries are performed at the Texas Medical Center than anywhere else in the world .
After a difficult winter , most of the Denny Party relocated across Elliott Bay and claimed land a second time at the site of present-day Pioneer Square . Charles Terry and John Low remained at the original landing location and reestablished their old land claim and called it " New York " , but renamed " New York Alki " in April 1853 , from a Chinook word meaning , roughly , " by and by " or " someday " . For the next few years , New York Alki and Duwamps competed for dominance , but in time Alki was abandoned and its residents moved across the bay to join the rest of the settlers .
Gaddafi organized demonstrations and distributed posters criticizing the monarchy . In October 1961 , he led a demonstration protesting Syria 's secession from the United Arab Republic . During this they broke windows of a local hotel accused of serving alcohol . Catching the authorities ' attention , they expelled his family from Sabha . Gaddafi moved to Misrata , there attending Misrata Secondary School . Maintaining his interest in Arab nationalist activism , he refused to join any of the banned political parties active in the city – including the Arab Nationalist Movement , the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party , and the Muslim Brotherhood – claiming he rejected factionalism . He read voraciously on the subjects of Nasser and the French Revolution of 1789 , as well as the works of Syrian political theorist Michel Aflaq and biographies of Abraham Lincoln , Sun Yat-sen , and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk .
Until the 1990s further replays would be played until one team was victorious . Some ties took as many as six matches to settle ; in their 1975 campaign , Fulham played a total of 12 games over six rounds , which remains the most games played by a team to reach a final . Replays were traditionally played three or four days after the original game , but from 1991–92 they were staged at least 10 days later on police advice . This led to penalty shoot-outs being introduced , the first of which came on 26 November 1991 when Rotherham United eliminated Scunthorpe United .
Strasbourg 's historic city centre , the Grande Île ( Grand Island ) , was classified a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1988 , the first time such an honour was placed on an entire city centre . Strasbourg is immersed in the Franco-German culture and although violently disputed throughout history , has been a bridge of unity between France and Germany for centuries , especially through the University of Strasbourg , currently the second largest in France , and the coexistence of Catholic and Protestant culture . The largest Islamic place of worship in France , the Strasbourg Grand Mosque , was inaugurated by French Interior Minister Manuel Valls on 27 September 2012 .
However , all of these facets of medieval university life are considered by standard scholarship to be independent medieval European developments with no tracable Islamic influence . Generally , some reviewers have pointed out the strong inclination of Makdisi of overstating his case by simply resting on " the accumulation of close parallels " , but all the while failing to point to convincing channels of transmission between the Muslim and Christian world . Norman Daniel points out that the Arab equivalent of the Latin disputation , the taliqa , was reserved for the ruler 's court , not the madrasa , and that the actual differences between Islamic fiqh and medieval European civil law were profound . The taliqa only reached Islamic Spain , the only likely point of transmission , after the establishment of the first medieval universities . In fact , there is no Latin translation of the taliqa and , most importantly , no evidence of Latin scholars ever showing awareness of Arab influence on the Latin method of disputation , something they would have certainly found noteworthy . Rather , it was the medieval reception of the Greek Organon which set the scholastic sic et non in motion . Daniel concludes that resemblances in method had more to with the two religions having " common problems : to reconcile the conflicting statements of their own authorities , and to safeguard the data of revelation from the impact of Greek philosophy " ; thus Christian scholasticism and similar Arab concepts should be viewed in terms of a parallel occurrence , not of the transmission of ideas from one to the other , a view shared by Hugh Kennedy .
Horizontal gene transfer refers to the transfer of genetic material through a mechanism other than reproduction . This mechanism is a common source of new genes in prokaryotes , sometimes thought to contribute more to genetic variation than gene duplication . It is a common means of spreading antibiotic resistance , virulence , and adaptive metabolic functions . Although horizontal gene transfer is rare in eukaryotes , likely examples have been identified of protist and alga genomes containing genes of bacterial origin .
In February 1853 , the British government of Lord Aberdeen , the prime minister , re-appointed Stratford Canning as British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire . :110 Having resigned the ambassadorship in January , he had been replaced by Colonel Rose as chargé d'affaires . Lord Stratford then turned around and sailed back to Constantinople , arriving there on 5 April 1853 . There he convinced the Sultan to reject the Russian treaty proposal , as compromising the independence of the Turks . The Leader of the Opposition in the British House of Commons , Benjamin Disraeli , blamed Aberdeen and Stratford 's actions for making war inevitable , thus starting the process which would eventually force the Aberdeen government to resign in January 1855 , over the war .
In Asia , various Chinese dynasties and Japanese shogunates controlled the Asian sphere . In Japan , the Edo period from 1600 to 1868 is also referred to as the early modern period . And in Korea , from the rising of Joseon Dynasty to the enthronement of King Gojong is referred to as the early modern period . In the Americas , Native Americans had built a large and varied civilization , including the Aztec Empire and alliance , the Inca civilization , the Mayan Empire and cities , and the Chibcha Confederation . In the west , the European kingdoms and movements were in a movement of reformation and expansion . Russia reached the Pacific coast in 1647 and consolidated its control over the Russian Far East in the 19th century .
City and Guilds College was founded in 1876 from a meeting of 16 of the City of London 's livery companies for the Advancement of Technical Education ( CGLI ) , which aimed to improve the training of craftsmen , technicians , technologists , and engineers . The two main objectives were to create a Central Institution in London and to conduct a system of qualifying examinations in technical subjects . Faced with their continuing inability to find a substantial site , the Companies were eventually persuaded by the Secretary of the Science and Art Department , General Sir John Donnelly ( who was also a Royal Engineer ) to found their institution on the eighty-seven acre ( 350,000 m² ) site at South Kensington bought by the 1851 Exhibition Commissioners ( for GBP 342,500 ) for 'purposes of art and science ' in perpetuity . The latter two colleges were incorporated by Royal Charter into the Imperial College of Science and Technology and the CGLI Central Technical College was renamed the City and Guilds College in 1907 , but not incorporated into Imperial College until 1910 .
Christianity came to Tuvalu in 1861 when Elekana , a deacon of a Congregational church in Manihiki , Cook Islands became caught in a storm and drifted for 8 weeks before landing at Nukulaelae on 10 May 1861 . Elekana began proselytising Christianity . He was trained at Malua Theological College , a London Missionary Society ( LMS ) school in Samoa , before beginning his work in establishing the Church of Tuvalu . In 1865 the Rev . A. W. Murray of the LMS – a Protestant congregationalist missionary society – arrived as the first European missionary where he too proselytised among the inhabitants of Tuvalu . By 1878 Protestantism was well established with preachers on each island . In the later 19th and early 20th centuries the ministers of what became the Church of Tuvalu ( Te Ekalesia Kelisiano Tuvalu ) were predominantly Samoans , who influenced the development of the Tuvaluan language and the music of Tuvalu .
Scotland 's and Northern Ireland 's licensing laws have long been more flexible , allowing local authorities to set pub opening and closing times . In Scotland , this stemmed out of [ clarification needed ] a late repeal of the wartime licensing laws , which stayed in force until 1976 .
Many of NARA 's most requested records are frequently used for genealogy research . This includes census records from 1790 to 1930 , ships ' passenger lists , and naturalization records .
The hydraulic crane was invented by Sir William Armstrong in 1846 , primarily for use at the Tyneside docks for loading cargo . These quickly supplanted the earlier steam driven elevators : exploiting Pascal 's law , they provided a much greater force . A water pump supplied a variable level of water pressure to a plunger encased inside a vertical cylinder , allowing the level of the platform ( carrying a heavy load ) to be raised and lowered . Counterweights and balances were also used to increase the lifting power of the apparatus .
Plymouth Council is currently undertaking a project of urban redevelopment called the " Vision for Plymouth " launched by the architect David Mackay and backed by both Plymouth City Council and the Plymouth Chamber of Commerce ( PCC ) . Its projects range from shopping centres , a cruise terminal , a boulevard and to increase the population to 300,000 and build 33,000 dwellings .

Morality plays emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished until 1550 . The most interesting morality play is The Castle of Perseverance which depicts mankind 's progress from birth to death . However , the most famous morality play and perhaps best known medieval drama is Everyman . Everyman receives Death 's summons , struggles to escape and finally resigns himself to necessity . Along the way , he is deserted by Kindred , Goods , and Fellowship - only Good Deeds goes with him to the grave .
While technically referring to the era before Christopher Columbus ' voyages of 1492 to 1504 , in practice the term usually includes the history of American indigenous cultures until Europeans either conquered or significantly influenced them , even if this happened decades or even centuries after Columbus ' initial landing . " Pre-Columbian " is used especially often in the context of discussing the great indigenous civilizations of the Americas , such as those of Mesoamerica ( the Olmec , the Toltec , the Teotihuacano , the Zapotec , the Mixtec , the Aztec , and the Maya civilizations ) and those of the Andes ( Inca Empire , Moche culture , Muisca Confederation , Cañaris ) .
Social insects , such as termites , ants and many bees and wasps , are the most familiar species of eusocial animal . They live together in large well-organized colonies that may be so tightly integrated and genetically similar that the colonies of some species are sometimes considered superorganisms . It is sometimes argued that the various species of honey bee are the only invertebrates ( and indeed one of the few non-human groups ) to have evolved a system of abstract symbolic communication where a behavior is used to represent and convey specific information about something in the environment . In this communication system , called dance language , the angle at which a bee dances represents a direction relative to the sun , and the length of the dance represents the distance to be flown . :309–311 Though perhaps not as advanced as honey bees , bumblebees also potentially have some social communication behaviors . Bombus terrestris , for example , exhibit a faster learning curve for visiting unfamiliar , yet rewarding flowers , when they can see a conspecific foraging on the same species .
But in statistical mechanics things get more complicated . On one hand , statistical mechanics is far superior to classical thermodynamics , in that thermodynamic behavior , such as glass breaking , can be explained by the fundamental laws of physics paired with a statistical postulate . But statistical mechanics , unlike classical thermodynamics , is time-reversal symmetric . The second law of thermodynamics , as it arises in statistical mechanics , merely states that it is overwhelmingly likely that net entropy will increase , but it is not an absolute law .
The Lost Pubs Project listed 28,095 closed pubs on 21 April 2015 , with photographs of many . In 2015 the rate of pub closures came under the scrutiny of Parliament in the UK , with a promise of legislation to improve relations between owners and tenants .
The distinctive characteristic of Gothic cathedrals of the Iberian Peninsula is their spatial complexity , with many areas of different shapes leading from each other . They are comparatively wide , and often have very tall arcades surmounted by low clerestories , giving a similar spacious appearance to the 'Hallenkirche of Germany , as at the Church of the Batalha Monastery in Portugal . Many of the cathedrals are completely surrounded by chapels . Like English cathedrals , each is often stylistically diverse . This expresses itself both in the addition of chapels and in the application of decorative details drawn from different sources . Among the influences on both decoration and form are Islamic architecture and , towards the end of the period , Renaissance details combined with the Gothic in a distinctive manner . The West front , as at Leon Cathedral , typically resembles a French west front , but wider in proportion to height and often with greater diversity of detail and a combination of intricate ornament with broad plain surfaces . At Burgos Cathedral there are spires of German style . The roofline often has pierced parapets with comparatively few pinnacles . There are often towers and domes of a great variety of shapes and structural invention rising above the roof .
He does not argue that any such conclusions are therefore true , or that this describes the actual methods of any particular scientist . [ citation needed ] Rather , it is recommended as an essential principle of methodology that , if enacted by a system or community , will lead to slow but steady progress of a sort ( relative to how well the system or community enacts the method ) . It has been suggested that Popper 's ideas are often mistaken for a hard logical account of truth because of the historical co-incidence of their appearing at the same time as logical positivism , the followers of which mistook his aims for their own .
IBM has constantly evolved since its inception . Over the past decade , it has steadily shifted its business mix by exiting commoditizing markets such as PCs , hard disk drives and DRAMs and focusing on higher-value , more profitable markets such as business intelligence , data analytics , business continuity , security , cloud computing , virtualization and green solutions , resulting in a higher quality revenue stream and higher profit margins . IBM 's operating margin expanded from 16.8 % in 2004 to 24.3 % in 2013 , and net profit margins expanded from 9.0 % in 2004 to 16.5 % in 2013 .
President Franklin D. Roosevelt promoted a " good neighbor " policy that sought better relations with Mexico . In 1935 a federal judge ruled that three Mexican immigrants were ineligible for citizenship because they were not white , as required by federal law . Mexico protested , and Roosevelt decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated Hispanics as white . The State Department , the Census Bureau , the Labor Department , and other government agencies therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of Mexican descent as white . This policy encouraged the League of United Latin American Citizens in its quest to minimize discrimination by asserting their whiteness .
In 1981 , large sections of the SEPTA Regional Rail service to the far suburbs of Philadelphia were discontinued due to lack of funding . Several projects have been proposed to extend rail service back to these areas , but lack of funding has again been the chief obstacle to implementation . These projects include the proposed Schuylkill Valley Metro to Wyomissing , PA , and extension of the Media/Elwyn line back to Wawa , PA. SEPTA 's Airport Regional Rail Line Regional Rail offers direct service to the Philadelphia International Airport .
Modern standard Italian itself is heavily based on the Latin-derived Florentine Tuscan language . The Tuscan-based language that would eventually become modern standard Italian had been used in poetry and literature since at least the 12th century , and it first became widely known in Italy through the works of authors such as Dante Alighieri , Giovanni Boccaccio , Niccolò Machiavelli , and Petrarch . Dante 's Florentine-Tuscan literary Italian thus became the language of the literate and upper class in Italy , and it spread throughout the peninsula as the lingua franca among the Italian educated class as well as Italian traveling merchants . The economic prowess and cultural and artistic importance of Tuscany in the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance further encouraged the diffusion of the Florentine-Tuscan Italian throughout Italy and among the educated and powerful , though local and regional languages remained the main languages of the common people .
The Portuguese language is derived from the Latin spoken by the romanized Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula around 2000 years ago—particularly the Celts , Tartessians , Lusitanians and Iberians . In the 15th and 16th centuries , the language spread worldwide as Portugal established a colonial and commercial empire between 1415 and 1999 . Portuguese is now spoken as a native language in five different continents , with Brazil accounting for the largest number of native Portuguese speakers of any country ( 200 million speakers in 2012 ) .
Philadelphia is also a major hub for Greyhound Lines , which operates 24-hour service to points east of the Mississippi River . Most of Greyhound 's services in Philadelphia operate to/from the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal , located at 1001 Filbert Street in Center City Philadelphia . In 2006 , the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal was the second busiest Greyhound terminal in the United States , after the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York . Besides Greyhound , six other bus operators provide service to the Center City Greyhound terminal : Bieber Tourways , Capitol Trailways , Martz Trailways , Peter Pan Bus Lines , Susquehanna Trailways , and the bus division for New Jersey Transit . Other services include Megabus and Bolt Bus .
For several decades , peace reigned in Tibet , but in 1792 the Qing Qianlong Emperor sent a large Chinese army into Tibet to push the invading Nepalese out . This prompted yet another Qing reorganization of the Tibetan government , this time through a written plan called the " Twenty-Nine Regulations for Better Government in Tibet " . Qing military garrisons staffed with Qing troops were now also established near the Nepalese border . Tibet was dominated by the Manchus in various stages in the 18th century , and the years immediately following the 1792 regulations were the peak of the Qing imperial commissioners ' authority ; but there was no attempt to make Tibet a Chinese province .
Following the purchase of an offshore lease in 2005 , Shell initiated its US $ 4.5 billion Arctic drilling program in 2006 , after the corporation purchased the " Kulluk " oil rig and leased the Noble Discoverer drillship . At inception , the project was led by Pete Slaiby , a Shell executive who had previously worked in the North Sea . However , after the purchase of a second offshore lease in 2008 , Shell only commenced drilling work in 2012 , due to the refurbishment of rigs , permit delays from the relevant authorities and lawsuits . The plans to drill in the Arctic led to protests from environmental groups , particularly Greenpeace ; furthermore , analysts in the energy field , as well as related industries , also expressed skepticism due to perceptions that drilling in the region is " too dangerous because of harsh conditions and remote locations " .
In 2002 , Queen 's " Bohemian Rhapsody " was voted " the UK 's favourite hit of all time " in a poll conducted by the Guinness World Records British Hit Singles Book . In 2004 the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame . Many scholars consider the " Bohemian Rhapsody " music video ground-breaking , and credit it with popularising the medium . Rock historian Paul Fowles states the song is " widely credited as the first global hit single for which an accompanying video was central to the marketing strategy " . It has been hailed as launching the MTV age . Acclaimed for their stadium rock , in 2005 an industry poll ranked Queen 's performance at Live Aid in 1985 as the best live act in history . In 2007 , they were also voted the greatest British band in history by BBC Radio 2 listeners .
The Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that jñāna ( knowledge ) is a sufficient means to moksha . It suggests that systematic techniques/practice ( personal experimentation ) combined with Samkhya 's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha . Yoga shares several central ideas with Advaita Vedanta , with the difference that Yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while Advaita Vedanta is a form of monistic personalism . Like Advaita Vedanta , the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy states that liberation/freedom in this life is achievable , and this occurs when an individual fully understands and realizes the equivalence of Atman ( soul , self ) and Brahman .
Somalis for centuries have practiced a form of customary law , which they call Xeer . Xeer is a polycentric legal system where there is no monopolistic agent that determines what the law should be or how it should be interpreted .
In 1945 , Plymouth-born Michael Foot was elected Labour MP for the war-torn constituency of Plymouth Devonport and after serving as Secretary of State for Education and responsible for the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act , went on to become one of the most distinguished leaders of the Labour party .
One of Hyderabad 's earliest newspapers , The Deccan Times , was established in the 1780s . In modern times , the major Telugu dailies published in Hyderabad are Eenadu , Andhra Jyothy , Sakshi and Namaste Telangana , while the major English papers are The Times of India , The Hindu and The Deccan Chronicle . The major Urdu papers include The Siasat Daily , The Munsif Daily and Etemaad . Many coffee table magazines , professional magazines and research journals are also regularly published . The Secunderabad Cantonment Board established the first radio station in Hyderabad State around 1919 . Deccan Radio was the first radio public broadcast station in the city starting on 3 February 1935 , with FM broadcasting beginning in 2000 . The available channels in Hyderabad include All India Radio , Radio Mirchi , Radio City , Red FM and Big FM .
Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest , filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete , in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called Pumping Iron . Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition , after losing significant weight to appear in the film Stay Hungry with Jeff Bridges . Lou Ferrigno proved not to be a threat , and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia .
Germany 's strong ties with Israel include cooperation on scientific and educational endeavors and the two states remain strong economic and military partners . Under the reparations agreement , by 2007 [ update ] Germany had paid 25 billion euros in reparations to the Israeli state and individual Israeli Holocaust survivors . The UK has kept full diplomatic relations with Israel since its formation having had two visits from heads of state in 2007 . The UK is seen as having a " natural " relationship with Israel on account of the British Mandate for Palestine . Relations between the two countries were also made stronger by former prime minister Tony Blair 's efforts for a two state resolution . Israel is included in the European Union 's European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) , which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer .
Portugal has considerable resources of wind and river power , the two most cost-effective renewable sources . Since the turn of the 21st century , there has been a trend towards the development of a renewable resource industry and reduction of both consumption and use of fossil fuel resources . In 2006 , the world 's largest solar power plant at that date , the Moura Photovoltaic Power Station , began operating near Moura , in the south , while the world 's first commercial wave power farm , the Aguçadoura Wave Farm , opened in the Norte region ( 2008 ) . By the end of 2006 , 66 % of the country 's electrical production was from coal and fuel power plants , while 29 % were derived from hydroelectric dams , and 6 % by wind energy .
Unlike other data cables ( e.g. , Ethernet , HDMI ) , each end of a USB cable uses a different kind of connector ; a Type-A or a Type-B . This kind of design was chosen to prevent electrical overloads and damaged equipment , as only the Type-A socket provides power . There are cables with Type-A connectors on both ends , but they should be used carefully . Therefore , in general , each of the different " sizes " requires four different connectors ; USB cables have the Type-A and Type-B plugs , and the corresponding receptacles are on the computer or electronic device . In common practice , the Type-A connector is usually the full size , and the Type-B side can vary as needed .
With the rise of disco in the US and punk rock in the UK , hard rock 's mainstream dominance was rivalled toward the later part of the decade . Disco appealed to a more diverse group of people and punk seemed to take over the rebellious role that hard rock once held . Early punk bands like The Ramones explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock , with almost all of their songs clocking in around two minutes with no guitar solos . However , new rock acts continued to emerge and record sales remained high into the 1980s . 1977 saw the début and rise to stardom of Foreigner , who went on to release several platinum albums through to the mid-1980s . Midwestern groups like Kansas , REO Speedwagon and Styx helped further cement heavy rock in the Midwest as a form of stadium rock . In 1978 , Van Halen emerged from the Los Angeles music scene with a sound based around the skills of lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen . He popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping , showcased on the song " Eruption " from the album Van Halen , which was highly influential in re-establishing hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion , while also redefining and elevating the role of electric guitar .
Once in Hollywood , the contestants perform individually or in groups in a series of rounds . Until season ten , there were usually three rounds of eliminations in Hollywood . In the first round the contestants emerged in groups but performed individually . For the next round , the contestants put themselves in small groups and perform a song together . In the final round , the contestants perform solo with a song of their choice a cappella or accompanied by a band‍—‌depending on the season . In seasons two and three , contestants were also asked to write original lyrics or melody in an additional round after the first round . In season seven , the group round was eliminated and contestants may , after a first solo performance and on judges approval , skip a second solo round and move directly to the final Hollywood round . In season twelve , the executive producers split up the females and males and chose the members to form the groups in the group round .
The third-generation iPod had a weak bass response , as shown in audio tests . The combination of the undersized DC-blocking capacitors and the typical low-impedance of most consumer headphones form a high-pass filter , which attenuates the low-frequency bass output . Similar capacitors were used in the fourth-generation iPods . The problem is reduced when using high-impedance headphones and is completely masked when driving high-impedance ( line level ) loads , such as an external headphone amplifier . The first-generation iPod Shuffle uses a dual-transistor output stage , rather than a single capacitor-coupled output , and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load .
Boston ( pronounced i/ˈbɒstən/ ) is the capital and largest city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States . Boston also served as the historic county seat of Suffolk County until Massachusetts disbanded county government in 1999 . The city proper covers 48 square miles ( 124 km2 ) with an estimated population of 655,884 in 2014 , making it the largest city in New England and the 24th largest city in the United States . The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area called Greater Boston , home to 4.7 million people and the tenth-largest metropolitan statistical area in the country . Greater Boston as a commuting region is home to 8.1 million people , making it the sixth-largest combined statistical area in the United States .
The transistor is the fundamental building block of modern electronic devices , and is ubiquitous in modern electronic systems . First conceived by Julius Lilienfeld in 1926 and practically implemented in 1947 by American physicists John Bardeen , Walter Brattain , and William Shockley , the transistor revolutionized the field of electronics , and paved the way for smaller and cheaper radios , calculators , and computers , among other things . The transistor is on the list of IEEE milestones in electronics , and Bardeen , Brattain , and Shockley shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for their achievement .
Hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals . Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice . These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks , but the gas 's high solubility is a metallurgical problem , contributing to the embrittlement of many metals , complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks .
Hume and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed a 'science of man ' , which was expressed historically in works by authors including James Burnett , Adam Ferguson , John Millar , and William Robertson , all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behaved in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of modernity . Modern sociology largely originated from this movement , and Hume 's philosophical concepts that directly influenced James Madison ( and thus the U.S. Constitution ) and as popularised by Dugald Stewart , would be the basis of classical liberalism .
In June 1940 , a German prisoner of war was overheard boasting that the British would never find the Knickebein , even though it was under their noses . The details of the conversation were passed to an RAF Air Staff technical advisor , Dr. R. V. Jones , who started an in-depth investigation which discovered that the Luftwaffe 's Lorenz receivers were more than blind-landing devices . Jones therefore began a search for the German beams . Avro Ansons of the Beam Approach Training Development Unit ( BATDU ) were flown up and down Britain fitted with a 30 MHz receiver to detect them . Soon a beam was traced to Derby ( which had been mentioned in Luftwaffe transmissions ) . The first jamming operations were carried out using requisitioned hospital electrocautery machines . A subtle form of distortion was introduced . Up to nine special transmitters directed their signals at the beams in a manner that widened its path , negating its ability to accurately locate targets . Confidence in the device was diminished by the time the Luftwaffe decided to launch large-scale raids . The counter operations were carried out by British Electronic Counter Measures ( ECM ) units under Wing Commander Edward Addison , No . 80 Wing RAF . The production of false radio navigation signals by re-transmitting the originals was a technique known as masking beacons ( meacons ) .
PAL consoles face another incompatibility when playing out-of-region cartridges : the NTSC video standard specifies video at 60 Hz while PAL operates at 50 Hz , resulting in approximately 16.7 % slower gameplay . Additionally , PAL 's higher resolution results in letterboxing of the output image . Some commercial PAL region releases exhibit this same problem and , therefore , can be played in NTSC systems without issue while others will face a 20 % speedup if played in an NTSC console . To mostly correct this issue , a switch can be added to place the SNES PPU into a 60 Hz mode supported by most newer PAL televisions . Later games will detect this setting and refuse to run , requiring the switch to be thrown only after the check completes .
The pricing of risk refers to the incremental compensation required by investors for taking on additional risk , which may be measured by interest rates or fees . Several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks ' risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis , enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have , and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward , readily understandable format .
According to Tilmann Vetter , the core of earliest Buddhism is the practice of dhyāna . Bronkhorst agrees that dhyana was a Buddhist invention , whereas Norman notes that " the Buddha 's way to release [ ... ] was by means of meditative practices . " Discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development .
In about 319 , when Athanasius was a deacon , a presbyter named Arius came into a direct conflict with Alexander of Alexandria . It appears that Arius reproached Alexander for what he felt were misguided or heretical teachings being taught by the bishop . Arius 's theological views appear to have been firmly rooted in Alexandrian Christianity , and his Christological views were certainly not radical at all . He embraced a subordinationist Christology which taught that Christ was the divine Son ( Logos ) of God , made , not begotten , heavily influenced by Alexandrian thinkers like Origen , and which was a common Christological view in Alexandria at the time . Support for Arius from powerful bishops like Eusebius of Caesarea and Eusebius of Nicomedia , further illustrate how Arius 's subordinationist Christology was shared by other Christians in the Empire . Arius was subsequently excommunicated by Alexander , and he would begin to elicit the support of many bishops who agreed with his position .
Health care delivery in Nigeria is a concurrent responsibility of the three tiers of government in the country , and the private sector . Nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987 , which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population , in part by implementing user fees . The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform , resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services . A comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of health care , with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost .
During the May Revolution of 1810 and the subsequent uprising of the provinces of Rio de la Plata , the Spanish colonial government moved to Montevideo . During that year and the next , Uruguayan revolutionary José Gervasio Artigas united with others from Buenos Aires against Spain . In 1811 , the forces deployed by the Junta Grande of Buenos Aires and the gaucho forces led by Artigas started a siege of Montevideo , which had refused to obey the directives of the new authorities of the May Revolution . The siege was lifted at the end of that year , when the military situation started deteriorating in the Upper Peru region .
Federalism refers to the mixed or compound mode of government , combining a general government ( the central or 'federal ' government ) with regional governments ( provincial , state , Land , cantonal , territorial or other sub-unit governments ) in a single political system . Its distinctive feature , exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism of the United States of America under the Constitution of 1789 , is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established . It can thus be defined as a form of government in which there is a division of powers between two levels of government of equal status .
The Frankish kingdom in northern Gaul split into kingdoms called Austrasia , Neustria , and Burgundy during the 6th and 7th centuries , all of them ruled by the Merovingian dynasty , who were descended from Clovis . The 7th century was a tumultuous period of wars between Austrasia and Neustria . Such warfare was exploited by Pippin ( d. 640 ) , the Mayor of the Palace for Austrasia who became the power behind the Austrasian throne . Later members of his family inherited the office , acting as advisers and regents . One of his descendants , Charles Martel ( d. 741 ) , won the Battle of Poitiers in 732 , halting the advance of Muslim armies across the Pyrenees . [ K ] Great Britain was divided into small states dominated by the kingdoms of Northumbria , Mercia , Wessex , and East Anglia , which were descended from the Anglo-Saxon invaders . Smaller kingdoms in present-day Wales and Scotland were still under the control of the native Britons and Picts . Ireland was divided into even smaller political units , usually known as tribal kingdoms , under the control of kings . There were perhaps as many as 150 local kings in Ireland , of varying importance .
The pulp papermaking process is said to have been developed in China during the early 2nd century AD , possibly as early as the year 105 A.D. , by the Han court eunuch Cai Lun , although the earliest archaeological fragments of paper derive from the 2nd century BC in China . The modern pulp and paper industry is global , with China leading its production and the United States right behind it .
The city hosted the 1964 Democratic National Convention which nominated Lyndon Johnson for President and Hubert Humphrey as Vice President . The convention and the press coverage it generated , however , cast a harsh light on Atlantic City , which by then was in the midst of a long period of economic decline . Many felt that the friendship between Johnson and Governor of New Jersey Richard J. Hughes led Atlantic City to host the Democratic Convention .
Although they did not fix their schedules to the clock in the modern sense , ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than modern DST does , often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of day length , so that each daylight hour was longer during summer . For example , Roman water clocks had different scales for different months of the year : at Rome 's latitude the third hour from sunrise , hora tertia , started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice , but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes . After ancient times , equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal , so civil time no longer varies by season . Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings , such as some Mount Athos monasteries and all Jewish ceremonies .
Houston ( i/ˈhjuːstən/ HYOO-stən ) is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth most populous city in the United States , located in Southeast Texas near the Gulf of Mexico . With a census-estimated 2014 population of 2.239 million people , within a land area of 599.6 square miles ( 1,553 km2 ) , it also is the largest city in the Southern United States , as well as the seat of Harris County . It is the principal city of Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land , which is the fifth most populated metropolitan area in the United States .
The infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers . Cold , dark molecular clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars . Infrared can also be used to detect protostars before they begin to emit visible light . Stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum , so nearby cool objects such as planets can be more readily detected . ( In the visible light spectrum , the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet . )
Following his triumph , Napoleon imposed the first elements of the Continental System through the Berlin Decree issued in November 1806 . The Continental System , which prohibited European nations from trading with Britain , was widely violated throughout his reign . In the next few months , Napoleon marched against the advancing Russian armies through Poland and was involved in the bloody stalemate at the Battle of Eylau in February 1807 . After a period of rest and consolidation on both sides , the war restarted in June with an initial struggle at Heilsberg that proved indecisive . On 14 June , however , Napoleon finally obtained an overwhelming victory over the Russians at the Battle of Friedland , wiping out the majority of the Russian army in a very bloody struggle . The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French . On 19 June , Czar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon . The latter assured the envoy that the Vistula River represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe . On that basis , the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of Tilsit after meeting on an iconic raft on the River Niemen . The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated : " I hate the English as much as you do . "
Land Forces during this period also deployed in support of peacekeeping operations within United Nations sanctioned conflicts . The nature of the Canadian Forces has continued to evolve . They have been deployed in Afghanistan until 2011 , under the NATO-led United Nations International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) , at the request of the Government of Afghanistan .
Unauthorized MP3 file sharing continues on next-generation peer-to-peer networks . Some authorized services , such as Beatport , Bleep , Juno Records , eMusic , Zune Marketplace , Walmart.com , Rhapsody , the recording industry approved re-incarnation of Napster , and Amazon.com sell unrestricted music in the MP3 format .
After being rendered obsolete by the redesign , the 1895 replica was presented in 1910 to the FA 's long-serving president Lord Kinnaird . Kinnaird died in 1923 , and his family kept it in their possession , out of view , until putting it up for auction in 2005 . It was duly sold at Christie 's auction house on 19 May 2005 for £420,000 ( £478,400 including auction fees and taxes ) . The sale price set a new world record for a piece of football memorabilia , surpassing the £254,000 paid for the Jules Rimet World Cup Trophy in 1997 . The successful bidder was David Gold , the then joint chairman of Birmingham City ; claiming the FA and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country , Gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation . Accordingly , Gold presented the trophy to the National Football Museum in Preston on 20 April 2006 , where it went on immediate public display . It later moved with the museum to its new location in Manchester . In November 2012 , it was ceremonially presented to Royal Engineers , after they beat Wanderers 7–1 in a charity replay of the first FA Cup final .
Slack ( 2003 ) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970 . Yale proved important as a site for this research . The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison , Grace E. Pickford , and G. Evelyn Hutchinson , and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists . All produced innovative research , including the opening of new subfields in embryology , endocrinology , and ecology , respectively , over a long period of time . Harrison 's group is shown to have been a classic research school ; Pickford 's and Hutchinson 's were not . Pickford 's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power . Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive , but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools . Hutchinson 's example shows that new models for research groups are needed , especially for those that include extensive field research .
In a tumbling pass , dismount or vault , landing is the final phase , following take off and flight This is a critical skill in terms of execution in competition scores , general performance , and injury occurrence . Without the necessary magnitude of energy dissipation during impact , the risk of sustaining injuries during somersaulting increases . These injuries commonly occur at the lower extremities such as : cartilage lesions , ligament tears , and bone bruises/fractures . To avoid such injuries , and to receive a high performance score , proper technique must be used by the gymnast . " The subsequent ground contact or impact landing phase must be achieved using a safe , aesthetic and well-executed double foot landing . " A successful landing in gymnastics is classified as soft , meaning the knee and hip joints are at greater than 63 degrees of flexion .
In 1644 , René Descartes theorized that pain was a disturbance that passed down along nerve fibers until the disturbance reached the brain , a development that transformed the perception of pain from a spiritual , mystical experience to a physical , mechanical sensation [ citation needed ] . Descartes 's work , along with Avicenna 's , prefigured the 19th-century development of specificity theory . Specificity theory saw pain as " a specific sensation , with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses " . Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory , which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality , but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light , pressure or temperature . By the mid-1890s , specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians , and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists . However , after a series of clinical observations by Henry Head and experiments by Max von Frey , the psychologists migrated to specificity almost en masse , and by century 's end , most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact .
Post-punk is a heterogeneous type of rock music that emerged in the wake of the punk movement of the 1970s . Drawing inspiration from elements of punk rock while departing from its musical conventions and wider cultural affiliations , post-punk music was marked by varied , experimentalist sensibilities and its " conceptual assault " on rock tradition . Artists embraced electronic music , black dance styles and the avant-garde , as well as novel recording technology and production techniques . The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics , as artists liberally drew on sources such as critical theory , cinema , performance art and modernist literature . Accompanying these musical developments were subcultures that produced visual art , multimedia performances , independent record labels and fanzines in conjunction with the music .
Drama is literature intended for performance . The form is often combined with music and dance , as in opera and musical theatre . A play is a subset of this form , referring to the written dramatic work of a playwright that is intended for performance in a theatre ; it comprises chiefly dialogue between characters , and usually aims at dramatic or theatrical performance rather than at reading . A closet drama , by contrast , refers to a play written to be read rather than to be performed ; hence , it is intended that the meaning of such a work can be realized fully on the page . Nearly all drama took verse form until comparatively recently .
Feynman was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society ( ForMemRS ) in 1965 . At this time in the early 1960s , Feynman exhausted himself by working on multiple major projects at the same time , including a request , while at Caltech , to " spruce up " the teaching of undergraduates . After three years devoted to the task , he produced a series of lectures that eventually became The Feynman Lectures on Physics . He wanted a picture of a drumhead sprinkled with powder to show the modes of vibration at the beginning of the book . Concerned over the connections to drugs and rock and roll that could be made from the image , the publishers changed the cover to plain red , though they included a picture of him playing drums in the foreword . The Feynman Lectures on Physics occupied two physicists , Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands , as part-time co-authors for several years . Even though the books were not adopted by most universities as textbooks , they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics . Many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books , including The Character of Physical Law , QED : The Strange Theory of Light and Matter , Statistical Mechanics , Lectures on Gravitation , and the Feynman Lectures on Computation .
In 2001 , she became the first African-American woman and second woman songwriter to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the American Society of Composers , Authors , and Publishers Pop Music Awards . Beyoncé was the third woman to have writing credits on three number one songs ( " Irreplaceable " , " Grillz " and " Check on It " ) in the same year , after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991 . She is tied with American songwriter Diane Warren at third with nine songwriting credits on number-one singles . ( The latter wrote her 9/11-motivated song " I Was Here " for 4 . ) In May 2011 , Billboard magazine listed Beyoncé at number 17 on their list of the " Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters " , for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . She was one of only three women on that list .
A move to " permanent daylight saving time " ( staying on summer hours all year with no time shifts ) is sometimes advocated , and has in fact been implemented in some jurisdictions such as Argentina , Chile , Iceland , Singapore , Uzbekistan and Belarus . Advocates cite the same advantages as normal DST without the problems associated with the twice yearly time shifts . However , many remain unconvinced of the benefits , citing the same problems and the relatively late sunrises , particularly in winter , that year-round DST entails . Russia switched to permanent DST from 2011 to 2014 , but the move proved unpopular because of the late sunrises in winter , so the country switched permanently back to " standard " or " winter " time in 2014 .
In 2004 , the Swaziland government acknowledged for the first time that it suffered an AIDS crisis , with 38.8 % of tested pregnant women infected with HIV ( see AIDS in Africa ) . The then Prime Minister Themba Dlamini declared a humanitarian crisis due to the combined effect of drought , land degradation , increased poverty , and HIV/AIDS . According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report , Swaziland is close to achieving universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment , defined as 80 % coverage or greater . Estimates of treatment coverage range from 70 % to 80 % of those infected . Life expectancy had fallen from 61 years in 2000 to 32 years in 2009 . Tuberculosis is also a significant problem , with an 18 % mortality rate . Many patients have a multi-drug resistant strain , and 83 % are co-infected with HIV .
Artifacts from the Paleolithic suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as early as 6,000 years ago . Lunar calendars were among the first to appear , either 12 or 13 lunar months ( either 354 or 384 days ) . Without intercalation to add days or months to some years , seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months . Lunisolar calendars have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year ( now known to be about 365.24 days ) and a year of just twelve lunar months . The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures , at least partly due to this relationship of months to years . Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica , particularly in ancient Mayan civilization . These calendars were religiously and astronomically based , with 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month .
The site of Richmond had been an important village of the Powhatan Confederacy , and was briefly settled by English colonists from Jamestown in 1609 , and in 1610–1611 . The present city of Richmond was founded in 1737 . It became the capital of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia in 1780 . During the Revolutionary War period , several notable events occurred in the city , including Patrick Henry 's " Give me liberty or give me death " speech in 1775 at St. John 's Church , and the passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom written by Thomas Jefferson . During the American Civil War , Richmond served as the capital of the Confederate States of America . The city entered the 20th century with one of the world 's first successful electric streetcar systems , as well as a national hub of African-American commerce and culture , the Jackson Ward neighborhood .
The culture of Greece has evolved over thousands of years , beginning in Mycenaean Greece and continuing most notably into Classical Greece , through the influence of the Roman Empire and its Greek Eastern continuation , the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire . Other cultures and nations , such as the Latin and Frankish states , the Ottoman Empire , the Venetian Republic , the Genoese Republic , and the British Empire have also left their influence on modern Greek culture , although historians credit the Greek War of Independence with revitalising Greece and giving birth to a single , cohesive entity of its multi-faceted culture .
In May 2014 , Oklahoma Director of Corrections , Robert Patton , recommended an indefinite hold on executions in the state after the botched execution of African-American Clayton Lockett . The prisoner had to be tasered to restrain him prior to the execution , and the lethal injection missed a vein in his groin , resulting in Lockett regaining consciousness , trying to get up , and to speak , before dying of a heart attack 43 minutes later , after the attempted execution had been called off . In 2015 , the state approved nitrogen asphyxiation as a method of execution .
The Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx is well known as one of the first transitional fossils to be found , and it provided support for the theory of evolution in the late 19th century . Archaeopteryx was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics : teeth , clawed fingers , and a long , lizard-like tail , as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds . It is not considered a direct ancestor of birds , though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor .
According to the scriptures , soon after the parinirvāṇa ( from Sanskrit : " highest extinguishment " ) of Gautama Buddha , the first Buddhist council was held . As with any ancient Indian tradition , transmission of teaching was done orally . The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teachings to ensure that no errors occurred in oral transmission . In the first council , Ānanda , a cousin of the Buddha and his personal attendant , was called upon to recite the discourses ( sūtras , Pāli suttas ) of the Buddha , and , according to some sources , the abhidhamma . Upāli , another disciple , recited the monastic rules ( vinaya ) . Most scholars regard the traditional accounts of the council as greatly exaggerated if not entirely fictitious . [ note 36 ] Richard Gombrich noted Sariputta led communal recitations of the Buddha 's teaching for preservation in the Buddha 's lifetime in Sangiti Sutta ( Digha Nikaya # 33 ) , and something similar to the First Council must have taken place to compose Buddhist scriptures .
The theories surrounding equal temperament began to be put in wider practice , especially as it enabled a wider range of chromatic possibilities in hard-to-tune keyboard instruments . Although Bach did not use equal temperament , as a modern piano is generally tuned , changes in the temperaments from the meantone system , common at the time , to various temperaments that made modulation between all keys musically acceptable , made possible Bach 's Well-Tempered Clavier .
The " yo yo " in the opinion polls continued into 1992 , though after November 1990 any Labour lead in the polls was rarely sufficient for a majority . Major resisted Kinnock 's calls for a general election throughout 1991 . Kinnock campaigned on the theme " It 's Time for a Change " , urging voters to elect a new government after more than a decade of unbroken Conservative rule . However , the Conservatives themselves had undergone a dramatic change in the change of leader from Thatcher to Major , at least in terms of style if not substance . From the outset , it was clearly a well-received change , as Labour 's 14-point lead in the November 1990 " Poll of Polls " was replaced by an 8 % Tory lead a month later .
Classified as a Subtropical Mediterranean climate ( Köppen Csb ) , Santa Monica enjoys an average of 310 days of sunshine a year . It is located in USDA plant hardiness zone 11a . Because of its location , nestled on the vast and open Santa Monica Bay , morning fog is a common phenomenon in May , June and early July ( caused by ocean temperature variations and currents ) . Like other inhabitants of the greater Los Angeles area , residents have a particular terminology for this phenomenon : the " May Gray " and the " June Gloom " . Overcast skies are common during June mornings , but usually the strong sun burns the fog off by noon . In the late winter/early summer , daily fog is a phenomenon too . It happens suddenly and it may last some hours or past sunset time . Nonetheless , it will sometimes stay cloudy and cool all day during June , even as other parts of the Los Angeles area enjoy sunny skies and warmer temperatures . At times , the sun can be shining east of 20th Street , while the beach area is overcast . As a general rule , the beach temperature is from 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit ( 3 to 6 degrees Celsius ) cooler than it is inland during summer days , and 5–10 degrees warmer during winter nights .
Hard rock had been established as a mainstream genre by 1965 . From the end of the 1960s , it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock , with both emerging as major radio formats in the US . Soft rock was often derived from folk rock , using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies . Major artists included Barbra Streisand , Carole King , Cat Stevens , James Taylor and Bread .
The BRA subsequently reevaluated its approach to urban renewal in its future projects , including the construction of Government Center . In 1965 , the first Community Health Center in the United States opened , the Columbia Point Health Center , in the Dorchester neighborhood . It mostly served the massive Columbia Point public housing complex adjoining it , which was built in 1953 . The health center is still in operation and was rededicated in 1990 as the Geiger-Gibson Community Health Center . The Columbia Point complex itself was redeveloped and revitalized into a mixed-income community called Harbor Point Apartments from 1984 to 1990 . By the 1970s , the city 's economy boomed after 30 years of economic downturn . A large number of high rises were constructed in the Financial District and in Boston 's Back Bay during this time period . This boom continued into the mid-1980s and later began again . Hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital , Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , and Brigham and Women 's Hospital lead the nation in medical innovation and patient care . Schools such as Boston College , Boston University , the Harvard Medical School , Northeastern University , Wentworth Institute of Technology , Berklee College of Music and Boston Conservatory attract students to the area . Nevertheless , the city experienced conflict starting in 1974 over desegregation busing , which resulted in unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s .
European maps continued to show this hypothesized land until Captain James Cook 's ships , HMS Resolution and Adventure , crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773 , in December 1773 and again in January 1774 . Cook came within about 120 km ( 75 mi ) of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice in January 1773 . The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica can be narrowed down to the crews of ships captained by three individuals . According to various organizations ( the National Science Foundation , NASA , the University of California , San Diego , and other sources ) , ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica or its ice shelf in 1820 : von Bellingshausen ( a captain in the Imperial Russian Navy ) , Edward Bransfield ( a captain in the Royal Navy ) , and Nathaniel Palmer ( a sealer out of Stonington , Connecticut ) . The expedition led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny reached a point within 32 km ( 20 mi ) from Queen Maud 's Land and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 69°21′28″S 2°14′50″W﻿ / ﻿69.35778°S 2.24722°W﻿ / -69.35778 ; -2.24722 , which became known as the Fimbul ice shelf . This happened three days before Bransfield sighted land , and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820 . The first documented landing on Antarctica was by the American sealer John Davis , apparently at Hughes Bay , near Cape Charles , in West Antarctica on 7 February 1821 , although some historians dispute this claim . The first recorded and confirmed landing was at Cape Adair in 1895 .
It is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400 . Nanjing remained the capital of the Ming Empire until 1421 , when the third emperor of the Ming dynasty , the Yongle Emperor , relocated the capital to Beijing .
The Mass of Paul VI was also in Latin but approval was given for the use of vernacular languages . There had been other instructions issued by the Pope in 1964 , 1967 , 1968 , 1969 and 1970 which centered on the reform of all liturgies of the Roman Church . These major reforms were not welcomed by all and in all countries . The sudden apparent " outlawing " of the 400-year-old Mass , the last typical edition of which being promulgated only a few years earlier in 1962 by Paul 's predecessor , Pope John XXIII , was not always explained well . Further experimentation with the new Mass by liturgists , such as the usage of pop/folk music ( as opposed to the Gregorian Chant advocated by Pope Pius X ) , along with concurrent changes in the order of sanctuaries , was viewed by some as vandalism . In 2007 , Pope Benedict XVI clarified that the 1962 Mass of John XXIII and the 1970 Mass of Paul VI are two forms of the same Roman Rite , the first , which had never been " juridically abrogated " , now being an " extraordinary form of the Roman Rite " , while the other " obviously is and continues to be the normal Form – the Forma ordinaria – of the Eucharistic Liturgy " .
Public institutions of higher education in Charleston include the College of Charleston ( the nation 's 13th-oldest university ) , The Citadel , The Military College of South Carolina , and the Medical University of South Carolina . The city is also home to private universities , including the Charleston School of Law . Charleston is also home to the Roper Hospital School of Practical Nursing , and the city has a downtown satellite campus for the region 's technical school , Trident Technical College . Charleston is also the location for the only college in the country that offers bachelor 's degrees in the building arts , The American College of the Building Arts . The Art Institute of Charleston , located downtown on North Market Street , opened in 2007 .
In England , one of the few licensed venues The Eclipse attracted people from up and down the country as it was open until the early hours . The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 was a government attempt to ban large rave dance events featuring music with " repetitive beats " . There were a number of abortive " Kill the Bill " demonstrations . The Spiral Tribe at Castle Morten was probably the nail in the coffin for illegal raves , and forced through the bill , which became law , in November 1994 . The music continued to grow and change , as typified by Leftfield with " Release the Pressure " , which introduced dub and reggae into the house sound , although Leftfield had prior releases , such as " Not Forgotten " released in 1990 on Sheffield 's Outer Rhythm records .
In 1781 , Immanuel Kant published the Critique of Pure Reason , one of the most influential works in the history of the philosophy of space and time . He describes time as an a priori notion that , together with other a priori notions such as space , allows us to comprehend sense experience . Kant denies that either space or time are substance , entities in themselves , or learned by experience ; he holds , rather , that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience . Spatial measurements are used to quantify how far apart objects are , and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between ( or duration of ) events . Although space and time are held to be transcendentally ideal in this sense , they are also empirically real—that is , not mere illusions .
The Muslims took control of the Island in 904 , after decades of fierce fighting , and the Emirate of Sicily was established . Muslim rule on the island lasted for about 120 years and was marked by cruelty and brutality against the native population , which was reduced into near slavery [ clarification needed ] and Christian churches across the island were all completely destroyed . [ page needed ] Palermo ( Balarm during Arab rule ) displaced Syracuse as the capital city of Sicily . It was said to have then begun to compete with Córdoba and Cairo in terms of importance and splendor . For more than one hundred years Palermo was the capital of a flourishing emirate . The Arabs also introduced many agricultural crops which remain a mainstay of Sicilian cuisine .
In April 2010 , Shell announced its intention to divest from downstream business of all African countries except South Africa and Egypt to Vitol and " Helios " . In several countries such as Tunisia , protests and strikes broke out . Shell denied rumours of the sellout . Shell continues however upstream activities/extracting crude oil in the oil-rich Niger Delta as well as downstream/commercial activities in South Africa . In June 2013 , the company announced a strategic review of its operations in Nigeria , hinting that assets could be divested . In August 2014 , the company disclosed it was in the process of finalizing the sale of its interests in four Nigerian oil fields .
Menzies ran strongly against Labor 's plans to nationalise the Australian banking system and , following victory in the 1949 election , secured a double dissolution election for April 1951 , after the Labor-controlled Senate refused to pass his banking legislation . The Liberal-Country Coalition was returned with control of the Senate . The Government was returned again in the 1954 election ; the formation of the anti-Communist Democratic Labor Party ( DLP ) and the consequent split in the Australian Labor Party early in 1955 helped the Liberals to another victory in December 1955 . John McEwen replaced Arthur Fadden as leader of the Country Party in March 1958 and the Menzies-McEwen Coalition was returned again at elections in November 1958 – their third victory against Labor 's H. V. Evatt . The Coalition was narrowly returned against Labor 's Arthur Calwell in the December 1961 election , in the midst of a credit squeeze . Menzies stood for office for the last time in the November 1963 election , again defeating Calwell , with the Coalition winning back its losses in the House of Representatives . Menzies went on to resign from parliament on 26 January 1966 .
It was believed that when people died , they would be confined to a gloomy world of Ereshkigal , whose realm was guarded by gateways with various monsters designed to prevent people entering or leaving . The dead were buried outside the city walls in graveyards where a small mound covered the corpse , along with offerings to monsters and a small amount of food . Those who could afford it sought burial at Dilmun . Human sacrifice was found in the death pits at the Ur royal cemetery where Queen Puabi was accompanied in death by her servants . It is also said that the Sumerians invented the first oboe-like instrument , and used them at royal funerals .
Historical aspects of the Expo line route are noteworthy . It uses the right-of-way for the Santa Monica Air Line that provided electric-powered freight and passenger service between Los Angeles and Santa Monica beginning in the 1920s . Service was discontinued in 1953 but diesel-powered freight deliveries to warehouses along the route continued until March 11 , 1988 . The abandonment of the line spurred concerns within the community and the entire right-of-way was purchased from Southern Pacific by Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority . The line was built in 1875 as the steam-powered Los Angeles and Independence Railroad to bring mining ore to ships in Santa Monica harbor and as a passenger excursion train to the beach .
Montini and Angelo Roncalli were considered to be friends , but when Roncalli , as Pope John XXIII announced a new Ecumenical Council , Cardinal Montini reacted with disbelief and said to Giulio Bevilacqua : " This old boy does not know what a hornets nest he is stirring up . " He was appointed to the Central Preparatory Commission in 1961 . During the Council , his friend Pope John XXIII asked him to live in the Vatican . He was a member of the Commission for Extraordinary Affairs but did not engage himself much into the floor debates on various issues . His main advisor was Monsignore Giovanni Colombo , whom he later appointed to be his successor in Milan The Commission was greatly overshadowed by the insistence of John XXIII to have the Council complete all its work in one single session before Christmas 1962 , to the 400th anniversary of the Council of Trent , an insistence which may have also been influenced by the Pope 's recent knowledge that he had cancer .
The major Allied participants were the United States , the Republic of China , the United Kingdom ( including the armed forces of British India , the Fiji Islands , Samoa , etc . ) , Australia , the Commonwealth of the Philippines , the Netherlands ( as the possessor of the Dutch East Indies and the western part of New Guinea ) , New Zealand , and Canada , all of whom were members of the Pacific War Council . Mexico , Free France and many other countries also took part , especially forces from other British colonies .
Between 10 and 17 October 1757 , a Hungarian general , Count András Hadik , serving in the Austrian army , executed what may be the most famous hussar action in history . When the Prussian King Frederick was marching south with his powerful armies , the Hungarian general unexpectedly swung his force of 5,000 , mostly hussars , around the Prussians and occupied part of their capital , Berlin , for one night . The city was spared for a negotiated ransom of 200,000 thalers . When Frederick heard about this humiliating occupation , he immediately sent a larger force to free the city . Hadik , however , left the city with his Hussars and safely reached the Austrian lines . Subsequently , Hadik was promoted to the rank of Marshal in the Austrian army .
The positions on the persistence of objects are somewhat similar . An endurantist holds that for an object to persist through time is for it to exist completely at different times ( each instance of existence we can regard as somehow separate from previous and future instances , though still numerically identical with them ) . A perdurantist on the other hand holds that for a thing to exist through time is for it to exist as a continuous reality , and that when we consider the thing as a whole we must consider an aggregate of all its " temporal parts " or instances of existing . Endurantism is seen as the conventional view and flows out of our pre-philosophical ideas ( when I talk to somebody I think I am talking to that person as a complete object , and not just a part of a cross-temporal being ) , but perdurantists have attacked this position . ( An example of a perdurantist is David Lewis . ) One argument perdurantists use to state the superiority of their view is that perdurantism is able to take account of change in objects .
The name " Seattle " appears on official Washington Territory papers dated May 23 , 1853 , when the first plats for the village were filed . In 1855 , nominal land settlements were established . On January 14 , 1865 , the Legislature of Territorial Washington incorporated the Town of Seattle with a board of trustees managing the city . The town of Seattle was disincorporated January 18 , 1867 and remained a mere precinct of King County until late 1869 , when a new petition was filed and the city was re-incorporated December 2 , 1869 with a Mayor-council government . The corporate seal of the City of Seattle carries the date " 1869 " and a likeness of Chief Sealth in left profile .
One of the first recorded instances of translation in the West was the rendering of the Old Testament into Greek in the 3rd century BCE . The translation is known as the " Septuagint " , a name that refers to the seventy translators ( seventy-two , in some versions ) who were commissioned to translate the Bible at Alexandria , Egypt . Each translator worked in solitary confinement in his own cell , and according to legend all seventy versions proved identical . The Septuagint became the source text for later translations into many languages , including Latin , Coptic , Armenian and Georgian .
The Immaculate Collection , Madonna 's first greatest-hits compilation album , was released in November 1990 . It included two new songs , " Justify My Love " and " Rescue Me " . The album was certified diamond by RIAA and sold over 30 million copies worldwide , becoming the best-selling compilation album by a solo artist in history . " Justify My Love " reached number one in the U.S. and top ten worldwide . Its music video featured scenes of sadomasochism , bondage , same-sex kissing , and brief nudity . The video was deemed too sexually explicit for MTV and was banned from the network . Madonna responded to the banning : " Why is it that people are willing to go and watch a movie about someone getting blown to bits for no reason at all , and nobody wants to see two girls kissing and two men snuggling ? "
There are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works however that Avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion . He did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory , if prophecy could be questioned , and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly , without digressing to consider epistemological matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers .
In 2010 , there were concerns among Tajik officials that Islamic militarism in the east of the country was on the rise following the escape of 25 militants from a Tajik prison in August , an ambush that killed 28 Tajik soldiers in the Rasht Valley in September , and another ambush in the valley in October that killed 30 soldiers , followed by fighting outside Gharm that left 3 militants dead . To date the country 's Interior Ministry asserts that the central government maintains full control over the country 's east , and the military operation in the Rasht Valley was concluded in November 2010 . However , fighting erupted again in July 2012 . In 2015 Russia will send more troops to Tajikistan , as confirmed by a report of STRATFOR ( magazine online )
After the Revolution of 1979 , as the new government imposed new laws and standards , a new age in Iranian cinema emerged , starting with Viva ... by Khosrow Sinai and followed by many other directors , such as Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panahi . Kiarostami , an admired Iranian director , planted Iran firmly on the map of world cinema when he won the Palme d'Or for Taste of Cherry in 1997 . The continuous presence of Iranian films in prestigious international festivals , such as the Cannes Film Festival , the Venice Film Festival , and the Berlin International Film Festival , attracted world attention to Iranian masterpieces . In 2006 , six Iranian films , of six different styles , represented Iranian cinema at the Berlin International Film Festival . Critics considered this a remarkable event in the history of Iranian cinema .
By the mid-18th century , Charles Town had become a bustling trade center , the hub of the Atlantic trade for the southern colonies . Charles Towne was also the wealthiest and largest city south of Philadelphia , in part because of the lucrative slave trade . By 1770 , it was the fourth-largest port in the colonies , after Boston , New York , and Philadelphia , with a population of 11,000—slightly more than half of them slaves . By 1708 , the majority of the colony 's population was slaves , and the future state would continue to be a majority of African descent until after the Great Migration of the early 20th century .
In January 2016 , the Eton College beagling club was accused by the League Against Cruel Sports of undertaking an illegal hare hunt . The allegations were accompanied by a video of the Eton Beagles chasing a hare , as 'the hunt staff urge the beagles on and make no efforts to call the dogs off . ' A spokesman representing Eton College released the following statement : " Eton College takes its legal responsibilities extremely seriously and expects all school activities to comply with the law . We are investigating this allegation as a matter of urgency and will be co-operating fully with the relevant authorities . "
In 1768 Russian-backed Ukrainian Haidamaks , pursuing Polish confederates , entered Balta , an Ottoman-controlled town on the border of Bessarabia in Ukraine , and massacred its citizens and burned the town to the ground . This action provoked the Ottoman Empire into the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774 . The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca of 1774 ended the war and provided freedom to worship for the Christian citizens of the Ottoman-controlled provinces of Wallachia and Moldavia . By the late 18th century , a number of defeats in several wars with Russia led some people in the Ottoman Empire to conclude that the reforms of Peter the Great had given the Russians an edge , and the Ottomans would have to keep up with Western technology in order to avoid further defeats .
Several Germanic tribes celebrated the returning of the daylight . A predominant deity was during this jubilee driven around in a noisy procession on a ship on wheels . The winter would be driven out , to make sure that fertility could return in spring . A central figure was possibly the fertility goddess Nerthus . Also there are some indications that the effigy of Nerthus or Freyr was placed on a ship with wheels and accompanied by a procession of people in animal disguise and men in women 's clothes . Aboard the ship would the marriage of a man and woman be consummated as a fertility ritual .
Note : Besides ethnic groups , Slavs often identify themselves with the local geographical region in which they live . Some of the major regional South Slavic groups include : Zagorci in northern Croatia , Istrijani in westernmost Croatia , Dalmatinci in southern Croatia , Boduli in Adriatic islands , Vlaji in hinterland of Dalmatia , Slavonci in eastern Croatia , Bosanci in Bosnia , Hercegovci in Herzegovina , Krajišnici in western Bosnia , but is more commonly used to refer to the Serbs of Croatia , most of whom are descendants of the Grenzers , and continued to live in the area which made up the Military Frontier until the Croatian war of independence , Semberci in northeast Bosnia , Srbijanci in Serbia proper , Šumadinci in central Serbia , Vojvođani in northern Serbia , Sremci in Syrmia , Bačvani in northwest Vojvodina , Banaćani in Banat , Sandžaklije ( Muslims in Serbia/Montenegro border ) , Kosovci in Kosovo , Bokelji in southwest Montenegro , Trakiytsi in Upper Thracian Lowlands , Dobrudzhantsi in north-east Bulgarian region , Balkandzhii in Central Balkan Mountains , Miziytsi in north Bulgarian region , Warmiaks and Masurians in north-east Polish regions Warmia and Mazuria , Pirintsi in Blagoevgrad Province , Ruptsi in the Rhodopes etc .
Early Presbyterians were careful to distinguish between the " church , " which referred the members , and the " meeting house , " which was the building in which the church met . Until the late 19th century , very few Presbyterians ever referred to their buildings as " churches . " Presbyterians believed that meeting-houses ( now called churches ) are buildings to support the worship of God . The decor in some instances was austere so as not to detract from worship . Early Presbyterian meeting-houses were extremely plain . No stained glass , no elaborate furnishings , and no images were to be found in the meeting-house . The pulpit , often raised so as only to be accessible by a staircase , was the centerpiece of the building .
Arsenal was the first club from the south of England to join The Football League , in 1893 . They entered the First Division in 1904 , and have since accumulated the second most points . Relegated only once , in 1913 , they continue the longest streak in the top division . In the 1930s , Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups , and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war . In 1970–71 , they won their first League and FA Cup Double . Between 1988 and 2005 , they won five League titles and five FA Cups , including two more Doubles . They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position .
The beginning of the Neolithic culture is considered to be in the Levant ( Jericho , modern-day West Bank ) about 10,200 – 8,800 BC . It developed directly from the Epipaleolithic Natufian culture in the region , whose people pioneered the use of wild cereals , which then evolved into true farming . The Natufian period was between 12,000 and 10,200 BC , and the so-called " proto-Neolithic " is now included in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic ( PPNA ) between 10,200 and 8,800 BC . As the Natufians had become dependent on wild cereals in their diet , and a sedentary way of life had begun among them , the climatic changes associated with the Younger Dryas are thought to have forced people to develop farming .
The city hosted the 2010 Commonwealth Games and annually hosts Delhi Half Marathon foot-race . The city has previously hosted the 1951 Asian Games and the 1982 Asian Games . New Delhi was interested in bidding for the 2019 Asian Games but was turned down by the government on 2 August 2010 amid allegations of corruption in 2010 Commonwealth Games .
Stadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs . For the 2009–10 season , average attendances across the league clubs were 34,215 for Premier League matches with a total aggregate attendance figure of 13,001,616 . This represents an increase of 13,089 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the league 's first season ( 1992–93 ) . However , during the 1992–93 season the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Report 's 1994–95 deadline for all-seater stadiums . The Premier League 's record average attendance of 36,144 was set during the 2007–08 season . This record was then beaten in the 2013–14 season recording an average attendance of 36,695 with a total attendance of just under 14 million , the highest average in England 's top flight since 1950 .
Approximately 12 million Africans were shipped to the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade from 1492 to 1888 , with 11.5 million of those shipped to South America and the Caribbean . Brazil was the largest importer in the Americas , with 5.5 million African slaves imported , followed by the British Caribbean with 2.76 million , the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland with 1.59 million Africans , and the French Caribbean with 1.32 million . Today their descendants number approximately 150 million in South America and the Caribbean . In addition to skin color , other physical characteristics such as facial features and hair texture are often variously used in classifying peoples as black in South America and the Caribbean . In South America and the Caribbean , classification as black is also closely tied to social status and socioeconomic variables , especially in light of social conceptions of " blanqueamiento " ( racial whitening ) and related concepts .
The city proper is home to less than one-thirteenth of the population of South Florida . Miami is the 42nd-most populous city in the United States . The Miami metropolitan area , which includes Miami-Dade , Broward and Palm Beach counties , had a combined population of more than 5.5 million people , ranked seventh largest in the United States , and is the largest metropolitan area in the Southeastern United States . As of 2008 [ update ] , the United Nations estimates that the Miami Urban Agglomeration is the 44th-largest in the world .
The iPod line can play several audio file formats including MP3 , AAC/M4A , Protected AAC , AIFF , WAV , Audible audiobook , and Apple Lossless . The iPod photo introduced the ability to display JPEG , BMP , GIF , TIFF , and PNG image file formats . Fifth and sixth generation iPod Classics , as well as third generation iPod Nanos , can additionally play MPEG-4 ( H.264/MPEG-4 AVC ) and QuickTime video formats , with restrictions on video dimensions , encoding techniques and data-rates . Originally , iPod software only worked with Mac OS ; iPod software for Microsoft Windows was launched with the second generation model . Unlike most other media players , Apple does not support Microsoft 's WMA audio format—but a converter for WMA files without Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) is provided with the Windows version of iTunes . MIDI files also can not be played , but can be converted to audio files using the " Advanced " menu in iTunes . Alternative open-source audio formats , such as Ogg Vorbis and FLAC , are not supported without installing custom firmware onto an iPod ( e.g. , Rockbox ) .
Antonio Vivaldi composed a mandolin concerto ( Concerto in C major Op.3 6 ) and two concertos for two mandolins and orchestra . Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart placed it in his 1787 work Don Giovanni and Beethoven created four variations of it . Antonio Maria Bononcini composed La conquista delle Spagne di Scipione Africano il giovane in 1707 and George Frideric Handel composed Alexander Balus in 1748 . Others include Giovani Battista Gervasio ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Giuseppe Giuliano ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Emanuele Barbella ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Domenico Scarlatti ( Sonata n.54 ( K.89 ) in D minor for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , and Addiego Guerra ( Sonata in G major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) .
Lee and Guenther have rejected most of the arguments put forward by Wilmsen . Doron Shultziner and others have argued that we can learn a lot about the life-styles of prehistoric hunter-gatherers from studies of contemporary hunter-gatherers—especially their impressive levels of egalitarianism .
The Victorian era in particular became notorious for the conditions under which children were employed . Children as young as four were employed in production factories and mines working long hours in dangerous , often fatal , working conditions . In coal mines , children would crawl through tunnels too narrow and low for adults . Children also worked as errand boys , crossing sweepers , shoe blacks , or selling matches , flowers and other cheap goods . Some children undertook work as apprentices to respectable trades , such as building or as domestic servants ( there were over 120,000 domestic servants in London in the mid-18th century ) . Working hours were long : builders worked 64 hours a week in summer and 52 in winter , while domestic servants worked 80 hour weeks .
The army 's major campaign against the Indians was fought in Florida against Seminoles . It took long wars ( 1818–58 ) to finally defeat the Seminoles and move them to Oklahoma . The usual strategy in Indian wars was to seize control of the Indians winter food supply , but that was no use in Florida where there was no winter . The second strategy was to form alliances with other Indian tribes , but that too was useless because the Seminoles had destroyed all the other Indians when they entered Florida in the late eighteenth century .
Popper left school at the age of 16 and attended lectures in mathematics , physics , philosophy , psychology and the history of music as a guest student at the University of Vienna . In 1919 , Popper became attracted by Marxism and subsequently joined the Association of Socialist School Students . He also became a member of the Social Democratic Workers ' Party of Austria , which was at that time a party that fully adopted the Marxist ideology . After the street battle in the Hörlgasse on 15 June 1919 , when police shot eight of his unarmed party comrades , he became disillusioned by what he saw to be the " pseudo-scientific " historical materialism of Marx , abandoned the ideology , and remained a supporter of social liberalism throughout his life .
Saint Valentine , a Roman Catholic Bishop or priest who was martyred in about 296 AD , seems to have had no known connection with romantic love , but the day of his martyrdom on the Roman Catholic calendar , Saint Valentine 's Day ( February 14 ) , became , in the 14th century , an occasion for lovers to send messages to each other . In recent years the celebration of Saint Valentine ' s day has spread beyond Christian countries to Japan and China and other parts of the world . The celebration of Saint Valentine 's Day is forbidden or strongly condemned in many Islamic countries , including Saudi Arabia , Pakistan and Iran . In Saudi Arabia , in 2002 and 2011 , religious police banned the sale of all Valentine 's Day items , telling shop workers to remove any red items , as the day is considered a Christian holiday .
While asthma is a well recognized condition , there is not one universal agreed upon definition . It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as " a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role . The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing , breathlessness , chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning . These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment " .
John 's personal life greatly affected his reign . Contemporary chroniclers state that John was sinfully lustful and lacking in piety . It was common for kings and nobles of the period to keep mistresses , but chroniclers complained that John 's mistresses were married noblewomen , which was considered unacceptable . John had at least five children with mistresses during his first marriage to Isabelle of Gloucester , and two of those mistresses are known to have been noblewomen . John 's behaviour after his second marriage to Isabella of Angoulême is less clear , however . None of John 's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried , and there is no actual documentary proof of adultery after that point , although John certainly had female friends amongst the court throughout the period . The specific accusations made against John during the baronial revolts are now generally considered to have been invented for the purposes of justifying the revolt ; nonetheless , most of John 's contemporaries seem to have held a poor opinion of his sexual behaviour .

After World War I the US Army started developing a dual-role ( AA/ground ) automatic 37 mm cannon , designed by John M. Browning . It was standardised in 1927 as the T9 AA cannon , but trials quickly revealed that it was worthless in the ground role . However , while the shell was a bit light ( well under 2 lbs ) it had a good effective ceiling and fired 125 rounds per minute ; an AA carriage was developed and it entered service in 1939 . The Browning 37mm proved prone to jamming , and was eventually replaced in AA units by the Bofors 40 mm . The Bofors had attracted attention from the US Navy , but none were acquired before 1939 . Also , in 1931 the US Army worked on a mobile anti-aircraft machine mount on the back of a heavy truck having four .30 caliber water-cooled machine guns and an optical director . It proved unsuccessful and was abandoned .
In March 2003 , a second rebel group , Movement for Democracy in Liberia , began launching attacks against Taylor from the southeast . Peace talks between the factions began in Accra in June of that year , and Taylor was indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone for crimes against humanity that same month . By July 2003 , the rebels had launched an assault on Monrovia . Under heavy pressure from the international community and the domestic Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace movement , Taylor resigned in August 2003 and went into exile in Nigeria .
The climate of Cork , like the rest of Ireland , is mild and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes . Cork lies in plant Hardiness zone 9b . Met Éireann maintains a climatological weather station at Cork Airport , a few kilometres south of the city . It should be noted that the airport is at an altitude of 151 metres ( 495 ft ) and temperatures can often differ by a few degrees between the airport and the city itself . There are also smaller synoptic weather stations at UCC and Clover Hill .
New York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world by the diplomatic consulates of Iceland and Latvia and by New York 's Baruch College . A book containing a series of essays titled New York , culture capital of the world , 1940–1965 has also been published as showcased by the National Library of Australia . In describing New York , author Tom Wolfe said , " Culture just seems to be in the air , like part of the weather . "
The 'OtherOS ' functionality was not present in the updated PS Slim models , and the feature was subsequently removed from previous versions of the PS3 as part of the machine 's firmware update version 3.21 which was released on April 1 , 2010 ; Sony cited security concerns as the rationale . The firmware update 3.21 was mandatory for access to the PlayStation Network . The removal caused some controversy ; as the update removed officially advertised features from already sold products , and gave rise to several class action lawsuits aimed at making Sony return the feature or provide compensation .
In most taxonomies , the flowering plants are treated as a coherent group . The most popular descriptive name has been Angiospermae ( Angiosperms ) , with Anthophyta ( " flowering plants " ) a second choice . These names are not linked to any rank . The Wettstein system and the Engler system use the name Angiospermae , at the assigned rank of subdivision . The Reveal system treated flowering plants as subdivision Magnoliophytina ( Frohne & U. Jensen ex Reveal , Phytologia 79 : 70 1996 ) , but later split it to Magnoliopsida , Liliopsida , and Rosopsida . The Takhtajan system and Cronquist system treat this group at the rank of division , leading to the name Magnoliophyta ( from the family name Magnoliaceae ) . The Dahlgren system and Thorne system ( 1992 ) treat this group at the rank of class , leading to the name Magnoliopsida . The APG system of 1998 , and the later 2003 and 2009 revisions , treat the flowering plants as a clade called angiosperms without a formal botanical name . However , a formal classification was published alongside the 2009 revision in which the flowering plants form the Subclass Magnoliidae .
The International Association for the Study of Pain advocates that the relief of pain should be recognized as a human right , that chronic pain should be considered a disease in its own right , and that pain medicine should have the full status of a specialty . It is a specialty only in China and Australia at this time . Elsewhere , pain medicine is a subspecialty under disciplines such as anesthesiology , physiatry , neurology , palliative medicine and psychiatry . In 2011 , Human Rights Watch alerted that tens of millions of people worldwide are still denied access to inexpensive medications for severe pain .
On March 30 , 2015 , it was announced that West is a co-owner , with various other music artists , in the music streaming service Tidal . The service specialises in lossless audio and high definition music videos . Jay Z acquired the parent company of Tidal , Aspiro , in the first quarter of 2015 . Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z , sixteen artist stakeholders ( such as Rihanna , Beyoncé , Madonna , Chris Martin , Nicki Minaj and more ) co-own Tidal , with the majority owning a 3 % equity stake . The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry , and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify , which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties . " The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again , to recognize its value " , stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal .
Eleven days after Orsini 's assassination attempt in France , Victoria 's eldest daughter married Prince Frederick William of Prussia in London . They had been betrothed since September 1855 , when Princess Victoria was 14 years old ; the marriage was delayed by the Queen and Prince Albert until the bride was 17 . The Queen and Albert hoped that their daughter and son-in-law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging Prussian state . Victoria felt " sick at heart " to see her daughter leave England for Germany ; " It really makes me shudder " , she wrote to Princess Victoria in one of her frequent letters , " when I look round to all your sweet , happy , unconscious sisters , and think I must give them up too – one by one . " Almost exactly a year later , Princess Victoria gave birth to the Queen 's first grandchild , Wilhelm , who would become the last German Kaiser .
The Pocitos district , near the beach of the same name , has many homes built by Bello and Reboratti between 1920 and 1940 , with a mixture of styles . Other landmarks in Pocitos are the " Edificio Panamericano " designed by Raul Sichero , and the " Positano " and " El Pilar " designed by Adolfo Sommer Smith and Luis García Pardo in the 1950s and 1960s . However , the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the face of this neighbourhood , with a cluster of modern apartment buildings for upper and upper middle class residents .

Eritrea 's ethnic groups each have their own styles of music and accompanying dances . Amongst the Tigrinya , the best known traditional musical genre is the guaila . Traditional instruments of Eritrean folk music include the stringed krar , kebero , begena , masenqo and the wata ( a distant/rudimentary cousin of the violin ) . The most popular Eritrean artist is the Tigrinya singer Helen Meles , who is noted for her powerful voice and wide singing range . Other prominent local musicians include the Kunama singer Dehab Faytinga , Ruth Abraha , Bereket Mengisteab , Yemane Baria , and the late Abraham Afewerki .
In 1975 , a group of Chicago Cubs fans based in Washington , D.C. formed the Emil Verban Society . The society is a select club of high profile Cub fans , currently headed by Illinois Senator Dick Durbin which is named for Emil Verban , who in three seasons with the Cubs in the 1940s batted .280 with 39 runs batted in and one home run . Verban was picked as the epitome of a Cub player , explains columnist George Will , because " He exemplified mediocrity under pressure , he was competent but obscure and typifying of the work ethics . " Verban initially believed he was being ridiculed , but his ill feeling disappeared several years later when he was flown to Washington to meet President Ronald Reagan , also a society member , at the White House . Hillary Clinton , Jim Belushi , Joe Mantegna , Rahm Emanuel , Dick Cheney and many others have been included among its membership .
The first few naval battles were disasters for Rome . However , after training more sailors and inventing a grappling engine , a Roman naval force was able to defeat a Carthaginian fleet , and further naval victories followed . The Carthaginians then hired Xanthippus of Carthage , a Spartan mercenary general , to reorganise and lead their army . He cut off the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy . The Romans then again defeated the Carthaginians in naval battle at the Battle of the Aegates Islands and left Carthage with neither a fleet nor sufficient coin to raise one . For a maritime power the loss of their access to the Mediterranean stung financially and psychologically , and the Carthaginians sued for peace .
Roncalli was summoned to the final ballot of the conclave at 4:00 pm . He was elected pope at 4:30 pm with a total of 38 votes . After the long pontificate of Pope Pius XII , the cardinals chose a man who – it was presumed because of his advanced age – would be a short-term or " stop-gap " pope . They wished to choose a candidate who would do little during the new pontificate . Upon his election , Cardinal Eugene Tisserant asked him the ritual questions of whether he would accept and if so , what name he would take for himself . Roncalli gave the first of his many surprises when he chose " John " as his regnal name . Roncalli 's exact words were " I will be called John " . This was the first time in over 500 years that this name had been chosen ; previous popes had avoided its use since the time of the Antipope John XXIII during the Western Schism several centuries before .
Barça 's local rival has always been Espanyol . Blanc-i-blaus , being one of the clubs granted royal patronage , was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans , unlike the multinational nature of Barça 's primary board . The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona , and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners . The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid . Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià .
A year before Alfonso III " the Great " of Asturias death , three of Alfonso 's sons rose in rebellion and forced him to abdicate , partitioning the kingdom among them . The eldest son , García , became king of León . The second son , Ordoño , reigned in Galicia , while the third , Fruela , received Asturias with Oviedo as his capital . Alfonso died in Zamora , probably in 910 . His former realm would be reunited when first García died childless and León passed to Ordoño . He in turn died when his children were too young to ascend ; Fruela became king of a reunited crown . His death the next year initiated a series of internecine struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century . It continued under that name [ clarification needed ] until incorporated into the Kingdom of Castile in 1230 , after Ferdinand III became joint king of the two kingdoms . This was done to avoid dynastic feuds and to maintain the Christian Kingdoms strong enough to prevent complete Muslim take over of the Iberian Peninsula and to further the Reconquista of Iberia by Christian armies .
Another major addition to the city 's museum scene is the Museum of Remembrance and Tolerance ( Museo de la Memoria y Tolerancia ) , inaugurated in early 2011 . The brainchild of two young Mexican women as a Holocaust museum , the idea morphed into a unique museum dedicated to showcasing all major historical events of discrimination and genocide . Permanent exhibits include those on the Holocaust and other large-scale atrocities . It also houses temporary exhibits ; one on Tibet was inaugurated by the Dalai Lama in September 2011 .
During the 19th and 20th century , many national political parties organized themselves into international organizations along similar policy lines . Notable examples are The Universal Party , International Workingmen 's Association ( also called the First International ) , the Socialist International ( also called the Second International ) , the Communist International ( also called the Third International ) , and the Fourth International , as organizations of working class parties , or the Liberal International ( yellow ) , Hizb ut-Tahrir , Christian Democratic International and the International Democrat Union ( blue ) . Organized in Italy in 1945 , the International Communist Party , since 1974 headquartered in Florence has sections in six countries . [ citation needed ] Worldwide green parties have recently established the Global Greens . The Universal Party , The Socialist International , the Liberal International , and the International Democrat Union are all based in London . Some administrations ( e.g . Hong Kong ) outlaw formal linkages between local and foreign political organizations , effectively outlawing international political parties .
Other pre-modern Chinese names for Tibet include Wusiguo ( Chinese : 烏斯國 ; pinyin : Wūsīguó ; cf . Tibetan dbus , Ü , [ wyʔ˨˧˨ ] ) , Wusizang ( Chinese : 烏斯藏 ; pinyin : wūsīzàng , cf . Tibetan dbus-gtsang , Ü-Tsang ) , Tubote ( Chinese : 圖伯特 ; pinyin : Túbótè ) , and Tanggute ( Chinese : 唐古忒 ; pinyin : Tánggǔtè , cf . Tangut ) . American Tibetologist Elliot Sperling has argued in favor of a recent tendency by some authors writing in Chinese to revive the term Tubote ( simplified Chinese : 图伯特 ; traditional Chinese : 圖伯特 ; pinyin : Túbótè ) for modern use in place of Xizang , on the grounds that Tubote more clearly includes the entire Tibetan plateau rather than simply the Tibet Autonomous Region .

In recent decades , the literacy rate of Rajasthan has increased significantly . In 1991 , the state 's literacy rate was only 38.55 % ( 54.99 % male and 20.44 % female ) . In 2001 , the literacy rate increased to 60.41 % ( 75.70 % male and 43.85 % female ) . This was the highest leap in the percentage of literacy recorded in India ( the rise in female literacy being 23 % ) . At the Census 2011 , Rajasthan had a literacy rate of 67.06 % ( 80.51 % male and 52.66 % female ) . Although Rajasthan 's literacy rate is below the national average of 74.04 % and although its female literacy rate is the lowest in the country , the state has been praised for its efforts and achievements in raising male and female literacy rates .
The polyphony of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century , with compositions by Josquin des Prez . The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument , although this instrument would merely double the singers ' parts and was not independent . By the 16th century , a cappella polyphony had further developed , but gradually , the cantata began to take the place of a cappella forms . 16th century a cappella polyphony , nonetheless , continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day . Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina , such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ " doubling " some or all of the voices . Such is seen in the life of Palestrina becoming a major influence on Bach , most notably in the aforementioned Mass in B Minor . Other composers that utilized the a cappella style , if only for the occasional piece , were Claudio Monteverdi and his masterpiece , Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata ( A lover 's tears at his beloved 's grave ) , which was composed in 1610 , and Andrea Gabrieli when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces , one of which was in the unaccompanied style . Learning from the preceding two composeres , Heinrich Schütz utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces , chief among these were the pieces in the oratorio style , which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week , such as Christ 's suffering and the Passion . Five of Schutz 's Historien were Easter pieces , and of these the latter three , which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints , those of Matthew , Luke and John , were all done a cappella style . This was a near requirement for this type of piece , and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted parts from either Christ or the authors were performed in a plainchant .
The forests play a vital role in harbouring more than 45,000 floral and 81,000 faunal species of which 5150 floral and 1837 faunal species are endemic . Plant and animal species confined to a specific geographical area are called endemic species . In reserved forests , rights to activities like hunting and grazing are sometimes given to communities living on the fringes of the forest , who sustain their livelihood partially or wholly from forest resources or products . The unclassed forests covers 6.4 percent of the total forest area and they are marked by the following characteristics :
The strength of beers has climbed during the later years of the 20th century . Vetter 33 , a 10.5 % abv ( 33 degrees Plato , hence Vetter " 33 " ) doppelbock , was listed in the 1994 Guinness Book of World Records as the strongest beer at that time , though Samichlaus , by the Swiss brewer Hürlimann , had also been listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the strongest at 14 % abv . Since then , some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers . Samuel Adams reached 20 % abv with Millennium , and then surpassed that amount to 25.6 % abv with Utopias . The strongest beer brewed in Britain was Baz 's Super Brew by Parish Brewery , a 23 % abv beer . In September 2011 , the Scottish brewery BrewDog produced Ghost Deer , which , at 28 % , they claim to be the world 's strongest beer produced by fermentation alone .
The character of New York 's large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses and townhouses and shabby tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930 . In contrast , New York City also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings . In neighborhoods such as Riverdale ( in the Bronx ) , Ditmas Park ( in Brooklyn ) , and Douglaston ( in Queens ) , large single-family homes are common in various architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian .
The Cherokee Nation instigated a 10-year language preservation plan that involved growing new fluent speakers of the Cherokee language from childhood on up through school immersion programs as well as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home . This plan was part of an ambitious goal that in 50 years , 80 % or more of the Cherokee people will be fluent in the language . The Cherokee Preservation Foundation has invested $ 3 million into opening schools , training teachers , and developing curricula for language education , as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used . There is a Cherokee language immersion school in Tahlequah , Oklahoma that educates students from pre-school through eighth grade . Graduates are fluent speakers of the language . Several universities offer Cherokee as a second language , including the University of Oklahoma and Northeastern State University .
Manhattan was on track to have an estimated 90,000 hotel rooms at the end of 2014 , a 10 % increase from 2013 . In October 2014 , the Anbang Insurance Group , based in China , purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US $ 1.95 billion , making it the world 's most expensive hotel ever sold .
From 1898 , it was commonly accepted that the name was of Celtic origin and meant place belonging to a man called *Londinos ; this explanation has since been rejected . Richard Coates put forward an explanation in 1998 that it is derived from the pre-Celtic Old European * ( p ) lowonida , meaning 'river too wide to ford ' , and suggested that this was a name given to the part of the River Thames which flows through London ; from this , the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name , *Lowonidonjon ; this requires quite a serious amendment however . The ultimate difficulty lies in reconciling the Latin form Londinium with the modern Welsh Llundain , which should demand a form * ( h ) lōndinion ( as opposed to *londīnion ) , from earlier *loundiniom . The possibility can not be ruled out that the Welsh name was borrowed back in from English at a later date , and thus can not be used as a basis from which to reconstruct the original name .
In Texas , English is the state 's de facto official language ( though it lacks de jure status ) and is used in government . However , the continual influx of Spanish-speaking immigrants increased the import of Spanish in Texas . Texas 's counties bordering Mexico are mostly Hispanic , and consequently , Spanish is commonly spoken in the region . The Government of Texas , through Section 2054.116 of the Government Code , mandates that state agencies provide information on their websites in Spanish to assist residents who have limited English proficiency .
The population of the region is 14 million spread across eight countries . On the rim of the mountains , on the plateaus and the plains the economy consists of manufacturing and service jobs whereas in the higher altitudes and in the mountains farming is still essential to the economy . Farming and forestry continue to be mainstays of Alpine culture , industries that provide for export to the cities and maintain the mountain ecology .
Nishimura 's force consisted of two battleships , one cruiser and four destroyers . Because they were observing radio silence , Nishimura was unable to synchronize with Shima and Kurita . Nishimura and Shima had failed to even coordinate their plans before the attacks – they were long-time rivals and neither wished to have anything to do with the other . When he entered the narrow Surigao Strait at about 02:00 , Shima was 22 miles ( 40 km ) behind him , and Kurita was still in the Sibuyan Sea , several hours from the beaches at Leyte . As they passed Panaon Island , Nishimura 's force ran into a trap set for them by the U.S.-Australian 7th Fleet Support Force . R. Adm. Jesse Oldendorf had six battleships , four heavy cruisers , four light cruisers , 29 destroyers and 39 PT boats . To pass the strait and reach the landings , Nishimura had to run the gauntlet . At about 03:00 the Japanese battleship Fusō and three destroyers were hit by torpedoes and Fusō broke in two . At 03:50 the U.S. battleships opened fire . Radar fire control meant they could hit targets from a much greater distance than the Japanese . The battleship Yamashiro , a cruiser and a destroyer were crippled by 16-inch ( 406 mm ) shells ; Yamashiro sank at 04:19 . Only one of Nishimura 's force of seven ships survived the engagement . At 04:25 Shima 's force of two cruisers and eight destroyers reached the battle . Seeing Fusō and believing her to be the wrecks of two battleships , Shima ordered a retreat , ending the last battleship-vs-battleship action in history .
There were guilds of dyers who specialized in red in Venice and other large Europeans cities . The Rubia plant was used to make the most common dye ; it produced an orange-red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans . For the wealthy , the dye used was Kermes , made from a tiny scale insect which fed on the branches and leaves of the oak tree . For those with even more money there was Polish Cochineal ; also known as Kermes vermilio or " Blood of Saint John " , which was made from a related insect , the Margodes polonicus . It made a more vivid red than ordinary Kermes . The finest and most expensive variety of red made from insects was the " Kermes " of Armenia ( Armenian cochineal , also known as Persian kirmiz ) , made by collecting and crushing Porphyophora hamelii , an insect which lived on the roots and stems of certain grasses . The pigment and dye merchants of Venice imported and sold all of these products and also manufactured their own color , called Venetian red , which was considered the most expensive and finest red in Europe . Its secret ingredient was arsenic , which brightened the color .
Emerging British acts included Free , who released their signature song " All Right Now " ( 1970 ) , which has received extensive radio airplay in both the UK and US . After the breakup of the band in 1973 , vocalist Paul Rodgers joined supergroup Bad Company , whose eponymous first album ( 1974 ) was an international hit . The mixture of hard rock and progressive rock , evident in the works of Deep Purple , was pursued more directly by bands like Uriah Heep and Argent . Scottish band Nazareth released their self-titled début album in 1971 , producing a blend of hard rock and pop that would culminate in their best selling , Hair of the Dog ( 1975 ) , which contained the proto-power ballad " Love Hurts " . Having enjoyed some national success in the early 1970s , Queen , after the release of Sheer Heart Attack ( 1974 ) and A Night at the Opera ( 1975 ) , gained international recognition with a sound that used layered vocals and guitars and mixed hard rock with heavy metal , progressive rock , and even opera . The latter featured the single " Bohemian Rhapsody " , which stayed at number one in the UK charts for nine weeks .
Originating as a popular form of entertainment in 19th-century Europe and later as a sideshow exhibition in North American traveling carnivals and vaudeville halls , professional wrestling grew into a standalone genre of entertainment with many diverse variations in cultures around the globe , and is now considered a multimillion-dollar entertainment industry . While it has greatly declined in Europe , in North America it has experienced several different periods of prominent cultural popularity during its century and a half of existence . The advent of television gave professional wrestling a new outlet , and wrestling ( along with boxing ) was instrumental in making pay-per-view a viable method of content delivery .
Most Western languages ( particularly those with writing systems based on the Latin , Cyrillic , Greek , Coptic , and Armenian alphabets ) use letter cases in their written form as an aid to clarity . Scripts using two separate cases are also called bicameral scripts . Many other writing systems make no distinction between majuscules and minuscules – a system called unicameral script or unicase . This includes most syllabic and other non-alphabetic scripts . The Georgian alphabet is special since it used to be bicameral , but today is mostly used in a unicameral way .
Artifacts from the Paleolithic suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as early as 6,000 years ago . Lunar calendars were among the first to appear , either 12 or 13 lunar months ( either 354 or 384 days ) . Without intercalation to add days or months to some years , seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months . Lunisolar calendars have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year ( now known to be about 365.24 days ) and a year of just twelve lunar months . The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures , at least partly due to this relationship of months to years . Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica , particularly in ancient Mayan civilization . These calendars were religiously and astronomically based , with 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month .
Philadelphia is also a major hub for Greyhound Lines , which operates 24-hour service to points east of the Mississippi River . Most of Greyhound 's services in Philadelphia operate to/from the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal , located at 1001 Filbert Street in Center City Philadelphia . In 2006 , the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal was the second busiest Greyhound terminal in the United States , after the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York . Besides Greyhound , six other bus operators provide service to the Center City Greyhound terminal : Bieber Tourways , Capitol Trailways , Martz Trailways , Peter Pan Bus Lines , Susquehanna Trailways , and the bus division for New Jersey Transit . Other services include Megabus and Bolt Bus .
A 2014 profile by the National Health Service showed Plymouth had higher than average levels of poverty and deprivation ( 26.2 % of population among the poorest 20.4 % nationally ) . Life expectancy , at 78.3 years for men and 82.1 for women , was the lowest of any region in the South West of England .
Ferdinand refused and went to Valencia instead of Madrid . Here , on 17 April , General Elio invited the King to reclaim his absolute rights and put his troops at the King 's disposition . The king abolished the Constitution of 1812 . He followed this act by dissolving the two chambers of the Spanish Parliament on 10 May . Thus began six years ( 1814–1820 ) of absolutist rule , but the constitution was reinstated during the Trienio Liberal , a period of three years of liberal government in Spain from 1820–1823 .
In partnership with Gardiner Greene Hubbard , Bell helped establish the publication Science during the early 1880s . In 1898 , Bell was elected as the second president of the National Geographic Society , serving until 1903 , and was primarily responsible for the extensive use of illustrations , including photography , in the magazine . he also became a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution ( 1898–1922 ) . The French government conferred on him the decoration of the Légion d'honneur ( Legion of Honor ) ; the Royal Society of Arts in London awarded him the Albert Medal in 1902 ; the University of Würzburg , Bavaria , granted him a PhD , and he was awarded the Franklin Institute 's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1912 . He was one of the founders of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1884 , and served as its president from 1891–92 . Bell was later awarded the AIEE 's Edison Medal in 1914 " For meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone " .
Another approach to hardware support for database management was ICL 's CAFS accelerator , a hardware disk controller with programmable search capabilities . In the long term , these efforts were generally unsuccessful because specialized database machines could not keep pace with the rapid development and progress of general-purpose computers . Thus most database systems nowadays are software systems running on general-purpose hardware , using general-purpose computer data storage . However this idea is still pursued for certain applications by some companies like Netezza and Oracle ( Exadata ) .
When a USB device is first connected to a USB host , the USB device enumeration process is started . The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device . The data rate of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling . After reset , the USB device 's information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address . If the device is supported by the host , the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state . If the USB host is restarted , the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices .
Bacteria display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes , called morphologies . Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0 micrometres in length . However , a few species are visible to the unaided eye — for example , Thiomargarita namibiensis is up to half a millimetre long and Epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches 0.7 mm . Among the smallest bacteria are members of the genus Mycoplasma , which measure only 0.3 micrometres , as small as the largest viruses . Some bacteria may be even smaller , but these ultramicrobacteria are not well-studied .
The Premier League has the highest revenue of any football league in the world , with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10 . In 2013–14 , due to improved television revenues and cost controls , the Premier League had net profits in excess of £78 million , exceeding all other football leagues . In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen 's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom 's broadcasting industry .
Gautama first went to study with famous religious teachers of the day , and mastered the meditative attainments they taught . But he found that they did not provide a permanent end to suffering , so he continued his quest . He next attempted an extreme asceticism , which was a religious pursuit common among the śramaṇas , a religious culture distinct from the Vedic one . Gautama underwent prolonged fasting , breath-holding , and exposure to pain . He almost starved himself to death in the process . He realized that he had taken this kind of practice to its limit , and had not put an end to suffering . So in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach . He devoted himself to anapanasati meditation , through which he discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way ( Skt . madhyamā-pratipad ) : a path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification .

Miami 's heavy-rail rapid transit system , Metrorail , is an elevated system comprising two lines and 23 stations on a 24.4-mile ( 39.3 km ) -long line . Metrorail connects the urban western suburbs of Hialeah , Medley , and inner-city Miami with suburban The Roads , Coconut Grove , Coral Gables , South Miami and urban Kendall via the central business districts of Miami International Airport , the Civic Center , and Downtown . A free , elevated people mover , Metromover , operates 21 stations on three different lines in greater Downtown Miami , with a station at roughly every two blocks of Downtown and Brickell . Several expansion projects are being funded by a transit development sales tax surcharge throughout Miami-Dade County .
Madaris were largely centred on the study of fiqh ( Islamic jurisprudence ) . The ijāzat al-tadrīs wa-al-iftāʼ ( " licence to teach and issue legal opinions " ) in the medieval Islamic legal education system had its origins in the 9th century after the formation of the madhāhib ( schools of jurisprudence ) . George Makdisi considers the ijāzah to be the origin of the European doctorate . However , in an earlier article , he considered the ijāzah to be of " fundamental difference " to the medieval doctorate , since the former was awarded by an individual teacher-scholar not obliged to follow any formal criteria , whereas the latter was conferred on the student by the collective authority of the faculty . To obtain an ijāzah , a student " had to study in a guild school of law , usually four years for the basic undergraduate course " and ten or more years for a post-graduate course . The " doctorate was obtained after an oral examination to determine the originality of the candidate 's theses " , and to test the student 's " ability to defend them against all objections , in disputations set up for the purpose . " These were scholarly exercises practised throughout the student 's " career as a graduate student of law . " After students completed their post-graduate education , they were awarded ijazas giving them the status of faqīh 'scholar of jurisprudence ' , muftī 'scholar competent in issuing fatwās ' , and mudarris 'teacher ' .
The Bell family home was in Cambridge , Massachusetts , until 1880 when Bell 's father-in-law bought a house in Washington , D.C. , and later in 1882 bought a home in the same city for Bell 's family , so that they could be with him while he attended to the numerous court cases involving patent disputes .
A monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early Ming dynasty is the Yangshan Quarry ( located some 15–20 km ( 9–12 mi ) east of the walled city and Ming Xiaoling mausoleum ) , where a gigantic stele , cut on the orders of the Yongle Emperor , lies abandoned , just as it was left 600 years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it .
When one Republican presidential candidate for the 2016 election ridiculed the liberalism of " New York values " in January 2016 , Donald Trump , leading in the polls , vigorously defended his city . The National Review , a conservative magazine published in the city since its founding by William F. Buckley , Jr. in 1955 , commented , " By hearkening back to New York 's heart after 9/11 , for a moment Trump transcended politics . How easily we forget , but for weeks after the terror attacks , New York was America . "
Śuddhodana was determined to see his son become a king , so he prevented him from leaving the palace grounds . But at age 29 , despite his father 's efforts , Gautama ventured beyond the palace several times . In a series of encounters—known in Buddhist literature as the four sights—he learned of the suffering of ordinary people , encountering an old man , a sick man , a corpse and , finally , an ascetic holy man , apparently content and at peace with the world . These experiences prompted Gautama to abandon royal life and take up a spiritual quest .
In the 1920s and 1930s , air power theorists Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell espoused the idea that air forces could win wars by themselves , without a need for land and sea fighting . It was thought there was no defence against air attack , particularly at night . Enemy industry , their seats of government , factories and communications could be destroyed , effectively taking away their means to resist . It was also thought the bombing of residential centres would cause a collapse of civilian will , which might have led to the collapse of production and civil life . Democracies , where the populace was allowed to show overt disapproval of the ruling government , were thought particularly vulnerable . This thinking was prevalent in both the RAF and what was then known as the United States Army Air Corps ( USAAC ) between the two world wars . RAF Bomber Command 's policy in particular would attempt to achieve victory through the destruction of civilian will , communications and industry .
Bernanke explained that between 1996 and 2004 , the U.S. current account deficit increased by $ 650 billion , from 1.5 % to 5.8 % of GDP . Financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad , much of it from countries running trade surpluses . These were mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations . The balance of payments identity requires that a country ( such as the U.S. ) running a current account deficit also have a capital account ( investment ) surplus of the same amount . Hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds ( capital ) flowed into the U.S. to finance its imports .
Nasser had few personal vices other than chain smoking . He maintained 18-hour workdays and rarely took time off for vacations . The combination of smoking and working long hours contributed to his poor health . He was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 1960s and by the time of his death in 1970 , he also had arteriosclerosis , heart disease , and high blood pressure . He suffered two major heart attacks ( in 1966 and 1969 ) , and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode . State media reported that Nasser 's absence from the public view at that time was a result of influenza .
In August 2008 , West revealed plans to open 10 Fatburger restaurants in the Chicago area ; the first was set to open in September 2008 in Orland Park . The second followed in January 2009 , while a third location is yet to be revealed , although the process is being finalized . His company , KW Foods LLC , bought the rights to the chain in Chicago . Ultimately , in 2009 , only two locations actually opened . In February 2011 , West shut down the Fatburger located in Orland Park . Later that year , the remaining Beverly location also was shuttered .
Berlin starts National Cyber Defense Initiative : On June 16 , 2011 , the German Minister for Home Affairs , officially opened the new German NCAZ ( National Center for Cyber Defense ) Nationales Cyber-Abwehrzentrum located in Bonn . The NCAZ closely cooperates with BSI ( Federal Office for Information Security ) Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik , BKA ( Federal Police Organisation ) Bundeskriminalamt ( Deutschland ) , BND ( Federal Intelligence Service ) Bundesnachrichtendienst , MAD ( Military Intelligence Service ) Amt für den Militärischen Abschirmdienst and other national organisations in Germany taking care of national security aspects . According to the Minister the primary task of the new organisation founded on February 23 , 2011 , is to detect and prevent attacks against the national infrastructure and mentioned incidents like Stuxnet .
During the years immediately following the novel 's publication , Harper Lee enjoyed the attention its popularity garnered her , granting interviews , visiting schools , and attending events honoring the book . In 1961 , when To Kill a Mockingbird was in its 41st week on the bestseller list , it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize , stunning Lee . It also won the Brotherhood Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews in the same year , and the Paperback of the Year award from Bestsellers magazine in 1962 . Starting in 1964 , Lee began to turn down interviews , complaining that the questions were monotonous , and grew concerned that attention she received bordered on the kind of publicity celebrities sought . Since the , she declined talking with reporters about the book . She also steadfastly refused to provide an introduction , writing in 1995 : " Introductions inhibit pleasure , they kill the joy of anticipation , they frustrate curiosity . The only good thing about Introductions is that in some cases they delay the dose to come . Mockingbird still says what it has to say ; it has managed to survive the years without preamble . "
Players may only be transferred during transfer windows that are set by the Football Association . The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January . Player registrations can not be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA , usually on an emergency basis . As of the 2010–11 season , the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21 , with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances . This was to enable the 'home grown ' rule to be enacted , whereby the League would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to be made up of 'home-grown players ' .
More recent Lancashire-born composers include Hugh Wood ( 1932- Parbold ) , Sir Peter Maxwell Davies ( 1934- , Salford ) , Sir Harrison Birtwistle ( 1934- , Accrington ) , Gordon Crosse ( 1937- , Bury ) , John McCabe ( 1939-2015 , Huyton ) , Roger Smalley ( 1943-2015 , Swinton ) , Nigel Osborne ( 1948- , Manchester ) , Steve Martland ( 1954-2013 , Liverpool ) , Simon Holt ( 1958- , Bolton ) and Philip Cashian ( 1963- , Manchester ) . The Royal Manchester College of Music was founded in 1893 to provide a northern counterpart to the London musical colleges . It merged with the Northern College of Music ( formed in 1920 ) to form the Royal Northern College of Music in 1972 .

Blue Ivy 's cries are included at the end of the song , and she was officially credited as " B.I.C . " on it . At two days old , she became the youngest person ever to appear on a Billboard chart when " Glory " debuted on the Hot R & B/Hip-Hop Songs chart .
Whitehead did not begin his career as a philosopher . In fact , he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education . Early in his life he showed great interest in and respect for philosophy and metaphysics , but it is evident that he considered himself a rank amateur . In one letter to his friend and former student Bertrand Russell , after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive , he wrote : " This further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic , onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter . " Ironically , in later life Whitehead would become one of the 20th century 's foremost metaphysicians .
The Legislature is composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives . The House , led by a speaker , has 73 members apportioned among the 15 counties on the basis of the national census , with each county receiving a minimum of two members . Each House member represents an electoral district within a county as drawn by the National Elections Commission and is elected by a plurality of the popular vote of their district into a six-year term . The Senate is made up of two senators from each county for a total of 30 senators . Senators serve nine-year terms and are elected at-large by a plurality of the popular vote . The vice president serves as the President of the Senate , with a President pro tempore serving in their absence .
On the other hand , classical ( analog ) television transmissions are usually horizontally polarized , because in urban areas buildings can reflect the electromagnetic waves and create ghost images due to multipath propagation . Using horizontal polarization , ghosting is reduced because the amount of reflection of electromagnetic waves in the p polarization ( horizontal polarization off the side of a building ) is generally less than s ( vertical , in this case ) polarization . Vertically polarized analog television has nevertheless been used in some rural areas . In digital terrestrial television such reflections are less problematic , due to robustness of binary transmissions and error correction .
Victoria later described her childhood as " rather melancholy " . Her mother was extremely protective , and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called " Kensington System " , an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller , Sir John Conroy , who was rumoured to be the Duchess 's lover . The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable ( including most of her father 's family ) , and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them . The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William 's bastard children , and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety . Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night , studied with private tutors to a regular timetable , and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel , Dash . Her lessons included French , German , Italian , and Latin , but she spoke only English at home .
The structures of most federal governments incorporate mechanisms to protect the rights of component states . One method , known as 'intrastate federalism ' , is to directly represent the governments of component states in federal political institutions . Where a federation has a bicameral legislature the upper house is often used to represent the component states while the lower house represents the people of the nation as a whole . A federal upper house may be based on a special scheme of apportionment , as is the case in the senates of the United States and Australia , where each state is represented by an equal number of senators irrespective of the size of its population .
Since the end of the World Wars , the term " great power " has been joined by a number of other power classifications . Foremost among these is the concept of the superpower , used to describe those nations with overwhelming power and influence in the rest of the world . It was first coined in 1944 by William T.R . Fox and according to him , there were three superpowers : the British Empire , the United States , and the Soviet Union . But by the mid-1950s the British Empire lost its superpower status , leaving the United States and the Soviet Union as the world 's superpowers . [ nb 2 ] The term middle power has emerged for those nations which exercise a degree of global influence , but are insufficient to be decisive on international affairs . Regional powers are those whose influence is generally confined to their region of the world .
Only one 5.1 surround sound option exists on a given LaserDisc ( either Dolby Digital or DTS ) , so if surround sound is desired , the disc must be matched to the capabilities of the playback equipment ( LD Player and Receiver/Decoder ) by the purchaser . A fully capable LaserDisc playback system includes a newer LaserDisc player that is capable of playing digital tracks , has a digital optical output for digital PCM and DTS audio , is aware of AC-3 audio tracks , and has an AC-3 coaxial output ; an external or internal AC-3 RF demodulator and AC-3 decoder ; and a DTS decoder . Many 1990s A/V receivers combine the AC-3 decoder and DTS decoder logic , but an integrated AC-3 demodulator is rare both in LaserDisc players and in later A/V receivers .
Chapultepec Park houses the Chapultepec Castle , now a museum on a hill that overlooks the park and its numerous museums , monuments and the national zoo and the National Museum of Anthropology ( which houses the Aztec Calendar Stone ) . Another piece of architecture is the Fine Arts Palace , a white marble theatre/museum whose weight is such that it has gradually been sinking into the soft ground below . Its construction began during the presidency of Porfirio Díaz and ended in 1934 , after being interrupted by the Mexican Revolution in the 1920s . The Plaza of the Three Cultures in the Tlatelolco neighbourhood , and the shrine and Basilicas of Our Lady of Guadalupe are also important sites . There is a double-decker bus , known as the " Turibus " , that circles most of these sites , and has timed audio describing the sites in multiple languages as they are passed .
Most languages today , even in countries that have no direct link to Greco-Roman culture , use some variant of the name " Neptune " for the planet . However , in Chinese , Japanese , and Korean , the planet 's name was translated as " sea king star " ( 海王星 ) , because Neptune was the god of the sea . In Mongolian , Neptune is called Dalain Van ( Далайн ван ) , reflecting its namesake god 's role as the ruler of the sea . In modern Greek the planet is called Poseidon ( Ποσειδώνας , Poseidonas ) , the Greek counterpart of Neptune . In Hebrew , " Rahab " ( רהב ) , from a Biblical sea monster mentioned in the Book of Psalms , was selected in a vote managed by the Academy of the Hebrew Language in 2009 as the official name for the planet , even though the existing Latin term " Neptun " ( נפטון ) is commonly used . In Māori , the planet is called Tangaroa , named after the Māori god of the sea . In Nahuatl , the planet is called Tlāloccītlalli , named after the rain god Tlāloc .
Remodelling of the structure began in 1762 . After his accession to the throne in 1820 , King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small , comfortable home . While the work was in progress , in 1826 , the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash . Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House , and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution . The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV . The cost of the renovations grew dramatically , and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash 's designs resulted in his removal as architect . On the death of George IV in 1830 , his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work . At one stage , William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament , after the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834 .
There have been instances where a country 's government bans a movie , resulting in the spread of copied videos and DVDs . Romanian-born documentary maker Ilinca Calugareanu wrote a New York Times article telling the story of Irina Margareta Nistor , a narrator for state TV under Nicolae Ceauşescu 's regime . A visitor from the west gave her bootlegged copies of American movies , which she dubbed for secret viewings through Romania . According to the article , she dubbed more than 3,000 movies and became the country 's second-most famous voice after Ceauşescu , even though no one knew her name until many years later .
Public expenditure rose from £10 million in 2001-02 to £12 million in 2005-06 to £28m in 2012-13 . The contribution of UK budgetary aid to total SHG government expenditure rose from £4.6 million in to £6.4 million to £12.1 million over the same period . Wages and salaries represent about 38 % of recurrent expenditure .
On April 18 , 1985 , a few months after taking his Senate seat , Kerry and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa traveled to Nicaragua and met the country 's president , Daniel Ortega . Though Ortega had won internationally certified elections , the trip was criticized because Ortega and his leftist Sandinista government had strong ties to Cuba and the USSR and were accused of human rights abuses . The Sandinista government was opposed by the right-wing CIA-backed rebels known as the Contras . While in Nicaragua , Kerry and Harkin talked to people on both sides of the conflict . Through the senators , Ortega offered a cease-fire agreement in exchange for the U.S. dropping support of the Contras . The offer was denounced by the Reagan administration as a " propaganda initiative " designed to influence a House vote on a $ 14 million Contra aid package , but Kerry said " I am willing ... .. to take the risk in the effort to put to test the good faith of the Sandinistas . " The House voted down the Contra aid , but Ortega flew to Moscow to accept a $ 200 million loan the next day , which in part prompted the House to pass a larger $ 27 million aid package six weeks later .
Portuguese universities have existed since 1290 . The oldest Portuguese university was first established in Lisbon before moving to Coimbra . Historically , within the scope of the Portuguese Empire , the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering school of the Americas ( the Real Academia de Artilharia , Fortificação e Desenho of Rio de Janeiro ) in 1792 , as well as the oldest medical college in Asia ( the Escola Médico-Cirúrgica of Goa ) in 1842 . The largest university in Portugal is the University of Lisbon .

The county has several museums ; those at Bath include the American Museum in Britain , the Museum of Bath Architecture , the Herschel Museum of Astronomy , the Jane Austen Centre , and the Roman Baths . Other visitor attractions which reflect the cultural heritage of the county include : Claverton Pumping Station , Dunster Working Watermill , the Fleet Air Arm Museum at Yeovilton , Nunney Castle , The Helicopter Museum in Weston-super-Mare , King John 's Hunting Lodge in Axbridge , Blake Museum Bridgwater , Radstock Museum , Museum of Somerset in Taunton , the Somerset Rural Life Museum in Glastonbury , and Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum .
In contrast to the entirely digital DVD , LaserDiscs use only analog video . As the LaserDisc format is not digitally encoded and does not make use of compression techniques , it is immune to video macroblocking ( most visible as blockiness during high motion sequences ) or contrast banding ( subtle visible lines in gradient areas , such as out-of-focus backgrounds , skies , or light casts from spotlights ) that can be caused by the MPEG-2 encoding process as video is prepared for DVD . Early DVD releases held the potential to surpass their LaserDisc counterparts , but often managed only to match them for image quality , and in some cases , the LaserDisc version was preferred . However , proprietary human-assisted encoders manually operated by specialists can vastly reduce the incidence of artifacts , depending on playing time and image complexity . By the end of LaserDisc 's run , DVDs were living up to their potential as a superior format .
There are two methods of corruption of the judiciary : the state ( through budget planning and various privileges ) , and the private . Budget of the judiciary in many transitional and developing countries is almost completely controlled by the executive . The latter undermines the separation of powers , as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary . The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject of the constitutional economics . Judicial corruption can be difficult to completely eradicate , even in developed countries .
The largest private university in Uruguay , is also located in Montevideo . ORT Uruguay was first established as a non-profit organization in 1942 , and was officially certified as a private university in September 1996 , becoming the second private educational institution in the country to achieve that status . [ citation needed ] It is a member of World ORT , an international educational network founded in 1880 by the Jewish community in Saint Petersburg , Russia . The university has about 8,000 students , distributed among 5 faculties and institutes , mainly geared towards the sciences and technology/engineering . Its current rector as of 2010 [ update ] is Dr. Jorge A. Grünberg .
German air attacks on the British Isles increased in 1915 and the AA efforts were deemed somewhat ineffective , so a Royal Navy gunnery expert , Admiral Sir Percy Scott , was appointed to make improvements , particularly an integrated AA defence for London . The air defences were expanded with more RNVR AA guns , 75 mm and 3-inch , the pom-poms being ineffective . The naval 3-inch was also adopted by the army , the QF 3 inch 20 cwt ( 76 mm ) , a new field mounting was introduced in 1916 . Since most attacks were at night , searchlights were soon used , and acoustic methods of detection and locating were developed . By December 1916 there were 183 AA Sections defending Britain ( most with the 3-inch ) , 74 with the BEF in France and 10 in the Middle East .
In 2008 , Houston received top ranking on Kiplinger 's Personal Finance Best Cities of 2008 list , which ranks cities on their local economy , employment opportunities , reasonable living costs , and quality of life . The city ranked fourth for highest increase in the local technological innovation over the preceding 15 years , according to Forbes magazine . In the same year , the city ranked second on the annual Fortune 500 list of company headquarters , first for Forbes magazine 's Best Cities for College Graduates , and first on their list of Best Cities to Buy a Home . In 2010 , the city was rated the best city for shopping , according to Forbes .
In 1977 , Gaddafi dissolved the Republic and created a new socialist state , the Jamahiriya ( " state of the masses " ) . Officially adopting a symbolic role in governance , he retained power as military commander-in-chief and head of the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing opponents . Overseeing unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad , Gaddafi 's support for foreign militants and alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing led to Libya 's label of " international pariah " . A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States and United Kingdom , resulting in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and United Nations-imposed economic sanctions . Rejecting his earlier ideological commitments , from 1999 Gaddafi encouraged economic privatization and sought rapprochement with Western nations , also embracing Pan-Africanism and helping to establish the African Union . Amid the Arab Spring , in 2011 an anti-Gaddafist uprising led by the National Transitional Council ( NTC ) broke out , resulting in the Libyan Civil War . NATO intervened militarily on the side of the NTC , bringing about the government 's downfall . Retreating to Sirte , Gaddafi was captured and killed by NTC militants .
The low mechanical complexity of hydraulic elevators in comparison to traction elevators makes them ideal for low rise , low traffic installations . They are less energy efficient as the pump works against gravity to push the car and its passengers upwards ; this energy is lost when the car descends on its own weight . The high current draw of the pump when starting up also places higher demands on a building’s electrical system . There are also environmental concerns should the lifting cylinder leak fluid into the ground .
Since 1066 , when Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror were crowned , the coronations of English and British monarchs have been held there . There have been at least 16 royal weddings at the abbey since 1100 . Two were of reigning monarchs ( Henry I and Richard II ) , although , before 1919 , there had been none for some 500 years .
After the downfall of the prior Gupta Empire in the middle of the 6th century , North India reverted to small republics and small monarchical states ruled by Gupta rulers . Harsha was a convert to Buddhism . He united the small republics from Punjab to central India , and their representatives crowned Harsha king at an assembly in April 606 giving him the title of Maharaja when he was merely 16 years old . Harsha belonged to Kanojia . He brought all of northern India under his control . The peace and prosperity that prevailed made his court a center of cosmopolitanism , attracting scholars , artists and religious visitors from far and wide . The Chinese traveler Xuan Zang visited the court of Harsha and wrote a very favorable account of him , praising his justice and generosity .
The effective area or effective aperture of a receiving antenna expresses the portion of the power of a passing electromagnetic wave which it delivers to its terminals , expressed in terms of an equivalent area . For instance , if a radio wave passing a given location has a flux of 1 pW / m2 ( 10−12 watts per square meter ) and an antenna has an effective area of 12 m2 , then the antenna would deliver 12 pW of RF power to the receiver ( 30 microvolts rms at 75 ohms ) . Since the receiving antenna is not equally sensitive to signals received from all directions , the effective area is a function of the direction to the source .
The Lacey Act of 1900 was the first federal law that regulated commercial animal markets . It prohibited interstate commerce of animals killed in violation of state game laws , and covered all fish and wildlife and their parts or products , as well as plants . Other legislation followed , including the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 , a 1937 treaty prohibiting the hunting of right and gray whales , and the Bald Eagle Protection Act of 1940 . These later laws had a low cost to society–the species were relatively rare–and little opposition was raised .
South Tucson is actually the name of an independent , incorporated town of 1 sq mi ( 2.6 km2 ) , completely surrounded by the city of Tucson , sitting just south of downtown . South Tucson has a colorful , dynamic history . It was first incorporated in 1936 , and later reincorporated in 1940 . The population consists of about 83 % Mexican-American and 10 % Native American residents . South Tucson is widely known for its many Mexican restaurants and the architectural styles which include bright outdoor murals , many of which have been painted over due to city policy .
Some scholars [ note 44 ] use other schemes . Buddhists themselves have a variety of other schemes . Hinayana ( literally " lesser vehicle " ) is used by Mahayana followers to name the family of early philosophical schools and traditions from which contemporary Theravada emerged , but as this term is rooted in the Mahayana viewpoint and can be considered derogatory , a variety of other terms are increasingly used instead , including Śrāvakayāna , Nikaya Buddhism , early Buddhist schools , sectarian Buddhism , conservative Buddhism , mainstream Buddhism and non-Mahayana Buddhism .
Although the advance in the Arakan had been halted to release troops and aircraft for the Battle of Imphal , the Americans and Chinese had continued to advance in northern Burma , aided by the Chindits operating against the Japanese lines of communication . In the middle of 1944 the Chinese Expeditionary Force invaded northern Burma from Yunnan province . They captured a fortified position at Mount Song . By the time campaigning ceased during the monsoon rains , the NCAC had secured a vital airfield at Myitkyina ( August 1944 ) , which eased the problems of air resupply from India to China over " The Hump " .
Paper at this point is uncoated . Coated paper has a thin layer of material such as calcium carbonate or china clay applied to one or both sides in order to create a surface more suitable for high-resolution halftone screens . ( Uncoated papers are rarely suitable for screens above 150 lpi . ) Coated or uncoated papers may have their surfaces polished by calendering . Coated papers are divided into matte , semi-matte or silk , and gloss . Gloss papers give the highest optical density in the printed image .
The company continued to carefully review submitted titles , giving them scores using a 40-point scale and allocating Nintendo 's marketing resources accordingly . Each region performed separate evaluations . Nintendo of America also maintained a policy that , among other things , limited the amount of violence in the games on its systems . One game , Mortal Kombat , would challenge this policy . A surprise hit in arcades in 1992 , Mortal Kombat features splashes of blood and finishing moves that often depict one character dismembering the other . Because the Genesis version retained the gore while the SNES version did not , it outsold the SNES version by a ratio of three or four-to-one .
A belt of massive fortifications was established around the city , most of which still stands today , renamed after French generals and generally classified as Monuments historiques ; most notably Fort Roon ( now Fort Desaix ) and Fort Podbielski ( now Fort Ducrot ) in Mundolsheim , Fort von Moltke ( now Fort Rapp ) in Reichstett , Fort Bismarck ( now Fort Kléber ) in Wolfisheim , Fort Kronprinz ( now Fort Foch ) in Niederhausbergen , Fort Kronprinz von Sachsen ( now Fort Joffre ) in Holtzheim and Fort Großherzog von Baden ( now Fort Frère ) in Oberhausbergen .
John Keate , Head Master from 1809 to 1834 , took over at a time when discipline was poor . Anthony Chenevix-Trench , Head Master from 1964 to 1970 , abolished the birch and replaced it with caning , also applied to the bare posterior , which he administered privately in his office . Chenevix-Trench also abolished corporal punishment administered by senior boys . Previously , House Captains were permitted to cane miscreants over the seat of the trousers . This was a routine occurrence , carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of a table . Less common but more severe were the canings administered by Pop ( see Eton Society below ) in the form of a " Pop-Tanning " , in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the President of Pop in the presence of all Pop members ( or , in earlier times , each member of Pop took it in turns to inflict a stroke ) . The culprit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers , as the caning would cut the cloth to shreds . This was the most severe form of physical punishment at Eton .
In Tunisia , Algeria , and Morocco , the Darijas ( spoken North African languages ) are sometimes considered more different from other Arabic dialects . Officially , North African countries prefer to give preference to the Literary Arabic and conduct much of their political and religious life in it ( adherence to Islam ) , and refrain from declaring each country 's specific variety to be a separate language , because Literary Arabic is the liturgical language of Islam and the language of the Islamic sacred book , the Qur'an . Although , especially since the 1960s , the Darijas are occupying an increasing use and influence in the cultural life of these countries . Examples of cultural elements where Darijas ' use became dominant include : theatre , film , music , television , advertisement , social media , folk-tale books and companies ' names .
Many other inventions marked Bell 's later life , including groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications , hydrofoils and aeronautics . Although Bell was not one of the 33 founders of the National Geographic Society , he had a strong influence on the magazine while serving as the second president from January 7 , 1898 until 1903 .
In general , translators have sought to preserve the context itself by reproducing the original order of sememes , and hence word order — when necessary , reinterpreting the actual grammatical structure , for example , by shifting from active to passive voice , or vice versa . The grammatical differences between " fixed-word-order " languages ( e.g . English , French , German ) and " free-word-order " languages ( e.g. , Greek , Latin , Polish , Russian ) have been no impediment in this regard . The particular syntax ( sentence-structure ) characteristics of a text 's source language are adjusted to the syntactic requirements of the target language .
The state of California was admitted to the United States in 1850 . That same year San Diego was designated the seat of the newly established San Diego County and was incorporated as a city . Joshua H. Bean , the last alcalde of San Diego , was elected the first mayor . Two years later the city was bankrupt ; the California legislature revoked the city 's charter and placed it under control of a board of trustees , where it remained until 1889 . A city charter was re-established in 1889 and today 's city charter was adopted in 1931 .
Tourism has been a key factor in economic development for many Southeast Asian countries , especially Cambodia . According to UNESCO , " tourism , if correctly conceived , can be a tremendous development tool and an effective means of preserving the cultural diversity of our planet . " Since the early 1990s , " even the non-ASEAN nations such as Cambodia , Laos , Vietnam and Burma , where the income derived from tourism is low , are attempting to expand their own tourism industries . " In 1995 , Singapore was the regional leader in tourism receipts relative to GDP at over 8 % . By 1998 , those receipts had dropped to less than 6 % of GDP while Thailand and Lao PDR increased receipts to over 7 % . Since 2000 , Cambodia has surpassed all other ASEAN countries and generated almost 15 % of its GDP from tourism in 2006 .
Emilio Marcos Palma was the first person born south of the 60th parallel south ( the continental limit according to the Antarctic Treaty ) , as well as the first one born on the Antarctic mainland , in 1978 at Base Esperanza , on the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula ; his parents were sent there along with seven other families by the Argentine government to determine if the continent was suitable for family life . In 1984 , Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Frei Montalva Station , becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica . Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station . As of 2009 , eleven children were born in Antarctica ( south of the 60th parallel south ) : eight at the Argentine Esperanza Base and three at the Chilean Frei Montalva Station .
Hard rock entered the 1990s as one of the dominant forms of commercial music . The multi-platinum releases of AC/DC 's The Razors Edge ( 1990 ) , Guns N ' Roses ' Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II ( both in 1991 ) , Ozzy Osbourne 's No More Tears ( 1991 ) , and Van Halen 's For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge ( 1991 ) showcased this popularity . Additionally , The Black Crowes released their debut album , Shake Your Money Maker ( 1990 ) , which contained a bluesy classic rock sound and sold five million copies . In 1992 , Def Leppard followed up 1987 's Hysteria with Adrenalize , which went multi-platinum , spawned four Top 40 singles and held the number one spot on the US album chart for five weeks .
Subsequently , it became one of Britain 's most significant honours to be buried or commemorated in the abbey . The practice of burying national figures in the abbey began under Oliver Cromwell with the burial of Admiral Robert Blake in 1657 . The practice spread to include generals , admirals , politicians , doctors and scientists such as Isaac Newton , buried on 4 April 1727 , and Charles Darwin , buried 26 April 1882 . Another was William Wilberforce who led the movement to abolish slavery in the United Kingdom and the Plantations , buried on 3 August 1833 . Wilberforce was buried in the north transept , close to his friend , the former Prime Minister , William Pitt . [ citation needed ]
Red wine may offer health benefits more so than white because potentially beneficial compounds are present in grape skin , and only red wine is fermented with skins . The amount of fermentation time a wine spends in contact with grape skins is an important determinant of its resveratrol content . Ordinary non-muscadine red wine contains between 0.2 and 5.8 mg/L , depending on the grape variety , because it is fermented with the skins , allowing the wine to absorb the resveratrol . By contrast , a white wine contains lower phenolic contents because it is fermented after removal of skins .
Shōen holders had access to manpower and , as they obtained improved military technology ( such as new training methods , more powerful bows , armor , horses , and superior swords ) and faced worsening local conditions in the ninth century , military service became part of shōen life . Not only the shōen but also civil and religious institutions formed private guard units to protect themselves . Gradually , the provincial upper class was transformed into a new military elite based on the ideals of the bushi ( warrior ) or samurai ( literally , one who serves ) .
While the original Xbox sold poorly in Japan , selling just 2 million units while it was on the market ( between 2002 and 2005 ) , [ citation needed ] the Xbox 360 sold even more poorly , selling only 1.5 million units from 2005 to 2011 . Edge magazine reported in August 2011 that initially lackluster and subsequently falling sales in Japan , where Microsoft had been unable to make serious inroads into the dominance of domestic rivals Sony and Nintendo , had led to retailers scaling down and in some cases discontinuing sales of the Xbox 360 completely .
There are 20 clubs in the Premier League . During the course of a season ( from August to May ) each club plays the others twice ( a double round-robin system ) , once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents , for a total of 38 games . Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw . No points are awarded for a loss . Teams are ranked by total points , then goal difference , and then goals scored . If still equal , teams are deemed to occupy the same position . If there is a tie for the championship , for relegation , or for qualification to other competitions , a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank . The three lowest placed teams are relegated into the Football League Championship , and the top two teams from the Championship , together with the winner of play-offs involving the third to sixth placed Championship clubs , are promoted in their place .
As a result of continued warming , the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert . In Eastern Antarctica , seed ferns or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time . Synapsids , commonly known as " mammal-like reptiles " , were common in Antarctica during the Early Triassic and included forms such as Lystrosaurus . The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the Jurassic period ( 206–146 Ma ) , and islands gradually rose out of the ocean . Ginkgo trees , conifers , bennettites , horsetails , ferns and cycads were plentiful during this period . In West Antarctica , coniferous forests dominated through the entire Cretaceous period ( 146–66 Ma ) , though southern beech became more prominent towards the end of this period . Ammonites were common in the seas around Antarctica , and dinosaurs were also present , though only three Antarctic dinosaur genera ( Cryolophosaurus and Glacialisaurus , from the Hanson Formation , and Antarctopelta ) have been described to date . It was during this era that Gondwana began to break up .
According to Orthodox Judaism , Jewish law today is based on the commandments in the Torah , as viewed through the discussions and debates contained in classical rabbinic literature , especially the Mishnah and the Talmud . Orthodox Judaism thus holds that the halakha represents the " will of God " , either directly , or as closely to directly as possible . The laws are from the word of God in the Torah , using a set of rules also revealed by God to Moses on Mount Sinai , and have been derived with the utmost accuracy and care , and thus the Oral Law is considered to be no less the word of God . If some of the details of Jewish law may have been lost over the millennia , they were reconstructed in accordance with internally consistent rules ; see The 13 rules by which Jewish law was derived .
The Mature Indus civilisation flourished from about 2600 to 1900 BCE , marking the beginning of urban civilisation on the subcontinent . The civilisation included urban centres such as Dholavira , Kalibangan , Ropar , Rakhigarhi , and Lothal in modern-day India , as well as Harappa , Ganeriwala , and Mohenjo-daro in modern-day Pakistan . The civilisation is noted for its cities built of brick , roadside drainage system , and multistoreyed houses and is thought to have had some kind of municipal organization .
The beginning of the Neolithic culture is considered to be in the Levant ( Jericho , modern-day West Bank ) about 10,200 – 8,800 BC . It developed directly from the Epipaleolithic Natufian culture in the region , whose people pioneered the use of wild cereals , which then evolved into true farming . The Natufian period was between 12,000 and 10,200 BC , and the so-called " proto-Neolithic " is now included in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic ( PPNA ) between 10,200 and 8,800 BC . As the Natufians had become dependent on wild cereals in their diet , and a sedentary way of life had begun among them , the climatic changes associated with the Younger Dryas are thought to have forced people to develop farming .
The most commonly given starting point for the Middle Ages is 476 , first used by Bruni . [ A ] For Europe as a whole , 1500 is often considered to be the end of the Middle Ages , but there is no universally agreed upon end date . Depending on the context , events such as Christopher Columbus 's first voyage to the Americas in 1492 , the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453 , or the Protestant Reformation in 1517 are sometimes used . English historians often use the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 to mark the end of the period . For Spain , dates commonly used are the death of King Ferdinand II in 1516 , the death of Queen Isabella I of Castile in 1504 , or the conquest of Granada in 1492 . Historians from Romance-speaking countries tend to divide the Middle Ages into two parts : an earlier " High " and later " Low " period . English-speaking historians , following their German counterparts , generally subdivide the Middle Ages into three intervals : " Early " , " High " , and " Late " . In the 19th century , the entire Middle Ages were often referred to as the " Dark Ages " , [ B ] but with the adoption of these subdivisions , use of this term was restricted to the Early Middle Ages , at least among historians .
In early 2009 , Spielberg shot the first film in a planned trilogy of motion capture films based on The Adventures of Tintin , written by Belgian artist Hergé , with Peter Jackson . The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn , was not released until October 2011 , due to the complexity of the computer animation involved . The world premiere took place on October 22 , 2011 in Brussels , Belgium . The film was released in North American theaters on December 21 , 2011 , in Digital 3D and IMAX . It received generally positive reviews from critics , and grossed over $ 373 million worldwide . The Adventures of Tintin won the award for Best Animated Feature Film at the Golden Globe Awards that year . It is the first non-Pixar film to win the award since the category was first introduced . Jackson has been announced to direct the second film .
In the same war , the Prussian Edward Schnell served the Aizu domain as a military instructor and procurer of weapons . He was granted the Japanese name Hiramatsu Buhei ( 平松武兵衛 ) , which inverted the characters of the daimyo 's name Matsudaira . Hiramatsu ( Schnell ) was given the right to wear swords , as well as a residence in the castle town of Wakamatsu , a Japanese wife , and retainers . In many contemporary references , he is portrayed wearing a Japanese kimono , overcoat , and swords , with Western riding trousers and boots .
A gastropub concentrates on quality food . The name is a portmanteau of pub and gastronomy and was coined in 1991 when David Eyre and Mike Belben took over The Eagle pub in Clerkenwell , London . The concept of a restaurant in a pub reinvigorated both pub culture and British dining , though has occasionally attracted criticism for potentially removing the character of traditional pubs .
Back in Warsaw that year , Chopin heard Niccolò Paganini play the violin , and composed a set of variations , Souvenir de Paganini . It may have been this experience which encouraged him to commence writing his first Études , ( 1829–32 ) , exploring the capacities of his own instrument . On 11 August , three weeks after completing his studies at the Warsaw Conservatory , he made his debut in Vienna . He gave two piano concerts and received many favourable reviews—in addition to some commenting ( in Chopin 's own words ) that he was " too delicate for those accustomed to the piano-bashing of local artists " . In one of these concerts , he premiered his Variations on Là ci darem la mano , Op . 2 ( variations on an aria from Mozart 's opera Don Giovanni ) for piano and orchestra . He returned to Warsaw in September 1829 , where he premiered his Piano Concerto No . 2 in F minor , Op . 21 on 17 March 1830 .
In 1940 , non-Hispanic whites constituted 86.8 % of the city 's population . The population peaked at more than two million residents in 1950 , then began to decline with the restructuring of industry , which led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs . In addition , suburbanization had been drawing off many of the wealthier residents to outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing . Revitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century , with much of the development in the Center City and University City areas of the city . After many of the old manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down , the city started attracting service businesses and began to more aggressively market itself as a tourist destination . Glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City . Historic areas such as Independence National Historical Park located in Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s . They are now among the most desirable living areas of Center City . This has slowed the city 's 40-year population decline after it lost nearly one-quarter of its population .
Spielberg first met actress Amy Irving in 1976 at the suggestion of director Brian De Palma , who knew he was looking for an actress to play in Close Encounters . After meeting her , Spielberg told his co-producer Julia Phillips , " I met a real heartbreaker last night . " :293 Although she was too young for the role , she and Spielberg began dating and she eventually moved in to what she described as his " bachelor funky " house . :294 They lived together for four years , but the stresses of their professional careers took a toll on their relationship . Irving wanted to be certain that whatever success she attained as an actress would be her own : " I do n't want to be known as Steven 's girlfriend , " she said , and chose not to be in any of his films during those years . :295
Chain department stores grew rapidly after 1920 , and provided competition for the downtown upscale department stores , as well as local department stores in small cities . J. C. Penney had four stores in 1908 , 312 in 1920 , and 1452 in 1930 . Sears , Roebuck & Company , a giant mail-order house , opened its first eight retail stores in 1925 , and operated 338 by 1930 , and 595 by 1940 . The chains reached a middle-class audience , that was more interested in value than in upscale fashions . Sears was a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men as well as women , especially with lines of hardware and building materials . It deemphasized the latest fashions in favor of practicality and durability , and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk . Its stores were oriented to motorists – set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience ; had ample , free , off-street parking ; and communicated a clear corporate identity . In the 1930s , the company designed fully air-conditioned , " windowless " stores whose layout was driven wholly by merchandising concerns .
In 2014 , the league announced the granting of a new franchise to former Mötley Crüe frontman Vince Neil , previously part-owner of the Jacksonville Sharks . That franchise , the Las Vegas Outlaws , were originally to play in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in 2015 , but instead played their home games at the Thomas & Mack Center , previous home to the Las Vegas Sting and Las Vegas Gladiators . After 20 years as a familiar name to the league , an AFL mainstay , the Iowa Barnstormers , departed the league to join the Indoor Football League . The San Antonio Talons folded on October 13 , 2014 , after the league ( which owned the team ) failed to find a new owner . On November 16 , 2014 , despite a successful season record-wise , the Pittsburgh Power became the second team to cease operations after the 2014 season . This resulted from poor attendance . It was later announced by the league that the Power would go dormant for 2015 and were looking for new ownership .
While Nasser was increasingly criticized by Egyptian intellectuals following the Six-Day War and his death in 1970 , the general public was persistently sympathetic both during and after Nasser 's life . According to political scientist Mahmoud Hamad , writing in 2008 , " nostalgia for Nasser is easily sensed in Egypt and all Arab countries today " . General malaise in Egyptian society , particularly during the Mubarak era , augmented nostalgia for Nasser 's presidency , which increasingly became associated with the ideals of national purpose , hope , social cohesion , and vibrant culture .
In February 1861 , secessionists in Tennessee 's state government—led by Governor Isham Harris—sought voter approval for a convention to sever ties with the United States , but Tennessee voters rejected the referendum by a 54–46 % margin . The strongest opposition to secession came from East Tennessee ( which later tried to form a separate Union-aligned state ) . Following the Confederate attack upon Fort Sumter in April and Lincoln 's call for troops from Tennessee and other states in response , Governor Isham Harris began military mobilization , submitted an ordinance of secession to the General Assembly , and made direct overtures to the Confederate government . The Tennessee legislature ratified an agreement to enter a military league with the Confederate States on May 7 , 1861 . On June 8 , 1861 , with people in Middle Tennessee having significantly changed their position , voters approved a second referendum calling for secession , becoming the last state to do so .
Old English is one of the West Germanic languages , and its closest relatives are Old Frisian and Old Saxon . Like other old Germanic languages , it is very different from Modern English and difficult for Modern English speakers to understand without study . Old English grammar is quite similar to that of modern German : nouns , adjectives , pronouns , and verbs have many inflectional endings and forms , and word order is much freer . The oldest Old English inscriptions were written using a runic system , but from about the 9th century this was replaced by a version of the Latin alphabet .
The earliest extant arguments that the world of experience is grounded in the mental derive from India and Greece . The Hindu idealists in India and the Greek Neoplatonists gave panentheistic arguments for an all-pervading consciousness as the ground or true nature of reality . In contrast , the Yogācāra school , which arose within Mahayana Buddhism in India in the 4th century CE , based its " mind-only " idealism to a greater extent on phenomenological analyses of personal experience . This turn toward the subjective anticipated empiricists such as George Berkeley , who revived idealism in 18th-century Europe by employing skeptical arguments against materialism .
The second-largest business district in terms of employment is La Défense , just west of the city , where many companies installed their offices in the 1990s . In 2010 it was the workplace of 144,600 employees , of whom 38 percent worked in finance and insurance , 16 percent in business support services . Two other important districts , Neuilly-sur-Seine and Levallois-Perret , are extensions of the Paris business district and of La Defense . Another district , including Boulogne-Billancourt , Issy-les-Moulineaux and the southern part of the 15th arrondissement , is a center of activity for the media and information technology .
A mummified man , determined to be 5,000 years old , was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian–Italian border in 1991 . By the 6th century BC , the Celtic La Tène culture was well established . Hannibal famously crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants , and the Romans had settlements in the region . In 1800 Napoleon crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000 . The 18th and 19th centuries saw an influx of naturalists , writers , and artists , in particular the Romantics , followed by the golden age of alpinism as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks . In World War II , Adolf Hitler kept a base of operation in the Bavarian Alps throughout the war .
With financial support from Sanders and Hubbard , Bell hired Thomas Watson as his assistant , [ N 15 ] and the two of them experimented with acoustic telegraphy . On June 2 , 1875 , Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell , at the receiving end of the wire , heard the overtones of the reed ; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech . That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary , not multiple reeds . This led to the " gallows " sound-powered telephone , which could transmit indistinct , voice-like sounds , but not clear speech .
On December 13 , 2013 , Beyoncé unexpectedly released her eponymous fifth studio album on the iTunes Store without any prior announcement or promotion . The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart , giving Beyoncé her fifth consecutive number-one album in the US . This made her the first woman in the chart 's history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one . Beyoncé received critical acclaim and commercial success , selling one million digital copies worldwide in six days ; The New York Times noted the album 's unconventional , unexpected release as significant . Musically an electro-R & B album , it concerns darker themes previously unexplored in her work , such as " bulimia , postnatal depression [ and ] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood " . The single " Drunk in Love " , featuring Jay Z , peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . In April 2014 , after much speculation in the weeks before , Beyoncé and Jay Z officially announced their On the Run Tour . It served as the couple 's first co-headlining stadium tour together . On August 24 , 2014 , she received the Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards . Knowles also took home three competitive awards : Best Video with a Social Message and Best Cinematography for " Pretty Hurts " , as well as best collaboration for " Drunk in Love " . In November , Forbes reported that Beyoncé was the top-earning woman in music for the second year in a row—earning $ 115 million in the year , more than double her earnings in 2013 . Beyoncé was reissued with new material in three forms : as an extended play , a box set , as well as a full platinum edition .
In 1355 in Buda King Casimir III the Great issued the first country-wide privilege for the nobility , in exchange for their agreement that in the lack of Casimir 's male heirs , the throne would pass to his nephew , Louis I of Hungary . He decreed that the nobility would no longer be subject to 'extraordinary ' taxes , or use their own funds for military expeditions abroad . He also promised that during travels of the royal court , the king and the court would pay for all expenses , instead of using facilities of local nobility .
Lack of political unity within Greece resulted in frequent conflict between Greek states . The most devastating intra-Greek war was the Peloponnesian War ( 431–404 BC ) , won by Sparta and marking the demise of the Athenian Empire as the leading power in ancient Greece . Both Athens and Sparta were later overshadowed by Thebes and eventually Macedon , with the latter uniting the Greek world in the League of Corinth ( also known as the Hellenic League or Greek League ) under the guidance of Phillip II , who was elected leader of the first unified Greek state in history .
Shorter , black-and-white daily strips began to appear early in the 20th century , and became established in newspapers after the success in 1907 of Bud Fisher 's Mutt and Jeff . Humour strips predominated at first , and in the 1920s and 1930s strips with continuing stories in genres such as adventure and drama also became popular . Thin periodicals called comic books appeared in the 1930s , at first reprinting newspaper comic strips ; by the end of the decade , original content began to dominate . The success in 1938 of Action Comics and its lead hero Superman marked the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books , in which the superhero genre was prominent .
A strong and prominent a cappella tradition was begun in the midwest part of the United States in 1911 by F. Melius Christiansen , a music faculty member at St. Olaf College in Northfield , Minnesota . The St. Olaf College Choir was established as an outgrowth of the local St. John 's Lutheran Church , where Christiansen was organist and the choir was composed , at least partially , of students from the nearby St. Olaf campus . The success of the ensemble was emulated by other regional conductors , and a rich tradition of a cappella choral music was born in the region at colleges like Concordia College ( Moorhead , Minnesota ) , Augustana College ( Rock Island , Illinois ) , Wartburg College ( Waverly , Iowa ) , Luther College ( Decorah , Iowa ) , Gustavus Adolphus College ( St. Peter , Minnesota ) , Augustana College ( Sioux Falls , South Dakota ) , and Augsburg College ( Minneapolis , Minnesota ) . The choirs typically range from 40 to 80 singers and are recognized for their efforts to perfect blend , intonation , phrasing and pitch in a large choral setting .
According to the latest International Monetary Fund estimates , its per capita GDP ( adjusted for purchasing power ) at $ 30,769 is just above the average of the European Union . [ citation needed ] Cyprus has been sought as a base for several offshore businesses for its low tax rates . Tourism , financial services and shipping are significant parts of the economy . Economic policy of the Cyprus government has focused on meeting the criteria for admission to the European Union . The Cypriot government adopted the euro as the national currency on 1 January 2008 .
Ibn Sina subsequently settled at Rey , in the vicinity of modern Tehran , the home town of Rhazes ; where Majd Addaula , a son of the last Buwayhid emir , was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother ( Seyyedeh Khatun ) . About thirty of Ibn Sina 's shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey . Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son , Shams al-Daula , however , compelled the scholar to quit the place . After a brief sojourn at Qazvin he passed southwards to Hamadãn where Shams al-Daula , another Buwayhid emir , had established himself . At first , Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady ; but the emir , hearing of his arrival , called him in as medical attendant , and sent him back with presents to his dwelling . Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier . The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country . Ibn Sina , however , remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel 's house , until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post . Even during this perturbed time , Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching . Every evening , extracts from his great works , the Canon and the Sanatio , were dictated and explained to his pupils . On the death of the emir , Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an apothecary , where , with intense assiduity , he continued the composition of his works .
Additionally , there are a number of Assistant Chiefs of Defence Staff , including the Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff ( Reserves and Cadets ) and the Defence Services Secretary in the Royal Household of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom , who is also the Assistant Chief of Defence Staff ( Personnel ) .
IBM also had their own DBMS in 1966 , known as Information Management System ( IMS ) . IMS was a development of software written for the Apollo program on the System/360 . IMS was generally similar in concept to CODASYL , but used a strict hierarchy for its model of data navigation instead of CODASYL 's network model . Both concepts later became known as navigational databases due to the way data was accessed , and Bachman 's 1973 Turing Award presentation was The Programmer as Navigator . IMS is classified [ by whom ? ] as a hierarchical database . IDMS and Cincom Systems ' TOTAL database are classified as network databases . IMS remains in use as of 2014 [ update ] .
The axiom of foundation established that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel , in such a manner that if one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession , hence excluding the possibility of a set belonging to itself . To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions , von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration , called the method of inner models , which later became an essential instrument in set theory .
The ancestors of modern bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the first forms of life to appear on Earth , about 4 billion years ago . For about 3 billion years , most organisms were microscopic , and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life . In 2008 , fossils of macroorganisms were discovered and named as the Francevillian biota . Although bacterial fossils exist , such as stromatolites , their lack of distinctive morphology prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution , or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species . However , gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial phylogeny , and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage . Bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence , that of the archaea and eukaryotes . Here , eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into endosymbiotic associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells , which were themselves possibly related to the Archaea . This involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of alphaproteobacterial symbionts to form either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes , which are still found in all known Eukarya ( sometimes in highly reduced form , e.g . in ancient " amitochondrial " protozoa ) . Later on , some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed cyanobacterial-like organisms . This led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants . There are also some algae that originated from even later endosymbiotic events . Here , eukaryotes engulfed a eukaryotic algae that developed into a " second-generation " plastid . This is known as secondary endosymbiosis .
His opponents have attacked Hayek as a leading promoter of " neoliberalism " . A British scholar , Samuel Brittan , concluded in 2010 , " Hayek 's book [ The Constitution of Liberty ] is still probably the most comprehensive statement of the underlying ideas of the moderate free market philosophy espoused by neoliberals . " Brittan adds that although Raymond Plant ( 2009 ) comes out in the end against Hayek 's doctrines , Plant gives The Constitution of Liberty a " more thorough and fair-minded analysis than it has received even from its professed adherents " .
Zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of " exceptional biologic and public health importance " , especially regarding prenatal and postnatal development . Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases . In children it causes growth retardation , delayed sexual maturation , infection susceptibility , and diarrhea . Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry , such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans . Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia , lethargy and copper deficiency .
In the first centuries AD , political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia . Two larger subdivisions appeared : the province ( Estonian : kihelkond ) and the land ( Estonian : maakond ) . Several elderships or villages made up a province . Nearly all provinces had at least one fortress . The king or other highest administrative official elder directed the defense of the local area . By the thirteenth century Estonia consisted of the following provinces : Revala , Harjumaa , Saaremaa , Hiiumaa , Läänemaa , Alempois , Sakala , Ugandi , Jogentagana , Soopoolitse , Vaiga , Mõhu , Nurmekund , Järvamaa and Virumaa .
The bel ( B ) and the smaller decibel ( dB ) are units of measurement of sound intensity invented by Bell Labs and named after him . [ N 28 ] Since 1976 the IEEE 's Alexander Graham Bell Medal has been awarded to honor outstanding contributions in the field of telecommunications .
To the north of China proper , the nomadic Xiongnu chieftain Modu Chanyu ( r. 209–174 BC ) conquered various tribes inhabiting the eastern portion of the Eurasian Steppe . By the end of his reign , he controlled Manchuria , Mongolia , and the Tarim Basin , subjugating over twenty states east of Samarkand . Emperor Gaozu was troubled about the abundant Han-manufactured iron weapons traded to the Xiongnu along the northern borders , and he established a trade embargo against the group . Although the embargo was in place , the Xiongnu found traders willing to supply their needs . Chinese forces also mounted surprise attacks against Xiongnu who traded at the border markets . In retaliation , the Xiongnu invaded what is now Shanxi province , where they defeated the Han forces at Baideng in 200 BC . After negotiations , the heqin agreement in 198 BC nominally held the leaders of the Xiongnu and the Han as equal partners in a royal marriage alliance , but the Han were forced to send large amounts of tribute items such as silk clothes , food , and wine to the Xiongnu .
Critics argue Napoleon 's true legacy must reflect the loss of status for France and needless deaths brought by his rule : historian Victor Davis Hanson writes , " After all , the military record is unquestioned—17 years of wars , perhaps six million Europeans dead , France bankrupt , her overseas colonies lost . " McLynn notes that , " He can be viewed as the man who set back European economic life for a generation by the dislocating impact of his wars . " However , Vincent Cronin replies that such criticism relies on the flawed premise that Napoleon was responsible for the wars which bear his name , when in fact France was the victim of a series of coalitions which aimed to destroy the ideals of the Revolution .
" The mind-stuff of the world is , of course , something more general than our individual conscious minds ... . The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time ; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it ... . It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed , has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness ... . Consciousness is not sharply defined , but fades into subconsciousness ; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature ... . It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character . But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience , and all else is remote inference . "
The philosophies of Buddhism and Zen , and to a lesser extent Confucianism and Shinto , influenced the samurai culture . Zen meditation became an important teaching due to it offering a process to calm one 's mind . The Buddhist concept of reincarnation and rebirth led samurai to abandon torture and needless killing , while some samurai even gave up violence altogether and became Buddhist monks after realizing how fruitless their killings were . Some were killed as they came to terms with these realizations in the battlefield . The most defining role that Confucianism played in samurai philosophy was to stress the importance of the lord-retainer relationship—the loyalty that a samurai was required to show his lord .
In 1926 Joseph P. Maxwell and Henry C. Harrison from Bell Telephone Laboratories disclosed that the recording pattern of the Western Electric " rubber line " magnetic disc cutter had a constant velocity characteristic . This meant that as frequency increased in the treble , recording amplitude decreased . Conversely , in the bass as frequency decreased , recording amplitude increased . Therefore , it was necessary to attenuate the bass frequencies below about 250 Hz , the bass turnover point , in the amplified microphone signal fed to the recording head . Otherwise , bass modulation became excessive and overcutting took place into the next record groove . When played back electrically with a magnetic pickup having a smooth response in the bass region , a complementary boost in amplitude at the bass turnover point was necessary . G. H. Miller in 1934 reported that when complementary boost at the turnover point was used in radio broadcasts of records , the reproduction was more realistic and many of the musical instruments stood out in their true form .
PlayStation 3 uses the Cell microprocessor , designed by Sony , Toshiba and IBM , as its CPU , which is made up of one 3.2 GHz PowerPC-based " Power Processing Element " ( PPE ) and eight Synergistic Processing Elements ( SPEs ) . The eighth SPE is disabled to improve chip yields . Only six of the seven SPEs are accessible to developers as the seventh SPE is reserved by the console 's operating system . Graphics processing is handled by the NVIDIA RSX 'Reality Synthesizer ' , which can produce resolutions from 480i/576i SD up to 1080p HD . PlayStation 3 has 256 MB of XDR DRAM main memory and 256 MB of GDDR3 video memory for the RSX .
Pubs that cater for a niche clientele , such as sports fans or people of certain nationalities are known as theme pubs . Examples of theme pubs include sports bars , rock pubs , biker pubs , Goth pubs , strip pubs , gay bars , karaoke bars and Irish pubs .
Tort law covers the entire imaginable spectrum of wrongs which humans can inflict upon each other , and of course , partially overlaps with wrongs also punishable by criminal law . Although the American Law Institute has attempted to standardize tort law through the development of several versions of the Restatement of Torts , many states have chosen to adopt only certain sections of the Restatements and to reject others . Thus , because of its immense size and diversity , American tort law can not be easily summarized .
Around 10,200 BC the first fully developed Neolithic cultures belonging to the phase Pre-Pottery Neolithic A ( PPNA ) appeared in the fertile crescent . Around 10,700 to 9,400 BC a settlement was established in Tell Qaramel , 10 miles north of Aleppo . The settlement included 2 temples dating back to 9,650 . Around 9000 BC during the PPNA , one of the world 's first towns , Jericho , appeared in the Levant . It was surrounded by a stone and marble wall and contained a population of 2000–3000 people and a massive stone tower . Around 6,400 BC the Halaf culture appeared in Lebanon , Israel and Palestine , Syria , Anatolia , and Northern Mesopotamia and subsisted on dryland agriculture .
Material transport elevators generally consist of an inclined plane on which a conveyor belt runs . The conveyor often includes partitions to ensure that the material moves forward . These elevators are often used in industrial and agricultural applications . When such mechanisms ( or spiral screws or pneumatic transport ) are used to elevate grain for storage in large vertical silos , the entire structure is called a grain elevator . Belt elevators are often used in docks for loading loose materials such as coal , iron ore and grain into the holds of bulk carriers
The main cast was revealed in December 2014 at the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios . Daniel Craig returned for his fourth appearance as James Bond , while Ralph Fiennes , Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw reprised their roles as M , Eve Moneypenny and Q respectively , having been established in Skyfall . Rory Kinnear also reprised his role as Bill Tanner in his third appearance in the series .
The first helicopter landing at the new airfield was conducted by the Wildcat HMA.2 ZZ377 from 825 Squadron 201 Flight , embarked on visiting HMS Lancaster on 23 October 2015 .
DNA samples from 1228 Russians show that the Y chromosomes analyzed , all except 20 ( 1.6 % ) fall into seven major haplogroups all characteristic to West Eurasian populations . Taken together , they account for 95 % of the total Russian Y chromosomal pool . Only ( 0.7 % ) fell into haplogroups that are specific to East and South Asian populations . Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) examined in Poles and Russians revealed the presence of all major European haplogroups , which were characterized by similar patterns of distribution in Poles and Russians . An analysis of the DNA did not reveal any specific combinations of unique mtDNA haplotypes and their subclusters . The DNA clearly shows that both Poles and Russians are not different from the neighbouring European populations .
Immunological research continues to become more specialized , pursuing non-classical models of immunity and functions of cells , organs and systems not previously associated with the immune system ( Yemeserach 2010 ) .
The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on the French colonies abroad . Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars , with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801 . Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens . During the Revolution , the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794 . Under the terms of Amiens , however , Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented . The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane , even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places . The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies , not slavery itself . Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue . Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture , the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army . In May 1803 , the last 8000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Haïti in 1804 . Seeing the failure of his colonial efforts , Napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States , instantly doubling the size of the U.S . The selling price in the Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre , a total of $ 15 million .
The names for the nation of Greece and the Greek people differ from the names used in other languages , locations and cultures . Although the Greeks call the country Hellas or Ellada ( Greek : Ἑλλάς or Ελλάδα ) and its official name is the Hellenic Republic , in English it is referred to as Greece , which comes from the Latin term Graecia as used by the Romans , which literally means 'the land of the Greeks ' , and derives from the Greek name Γραικός . However , the name Hellas is sometimes used in English as well .
Throughout their history , Slavs came into contact with non-Slavic groups . In the postulated homeland region ( present-day Ukraine ) , they had contacts with the Iranic Sarmatians and the Germanic Goths . After their subsequent spread , they began assimilating non-Slavic peoples . For example , in the Balkans , there were Paleo-Balkan peoples , such as Romanized and Hellenized ( Jireček Line ) Illyrians , Thracians and Dacians , as well as Greeks and Celtic Scordisci . Over time , due to the larger number of Slavs , most descendants of the indigenous populations of the Balkans were Slavicized . The Thracians and Illyrians vanished from the population during this period – although the modern Albanian nation claims descent from the Illyrians . Exceptions are Greece , where the lesser numbered Slavs scattered there came to be Hellenized ( aided in time by more Greeks returning to Greece in the 9th century and the role of the church and administration ) and Romania where Slavic people settled en route for present-day Greece , Republic of Macedonia , Bulgaria and East Thrace whereby the Slavic population had come to assimilate . Bulgars were also assimilated by local Slavs but their ruling status and subsequent land cast the nominal legacy of Bulgarian country and people onto all future generations . The Romance speakers within the fortified Dalmatian cities managed to retain their culture and language for a long time , as Dalmatian Romance was spoken until the high Middle Ages . However , they too were eventually assimilated into the body of Slavs .

Average annual precipitation is 15 inches ( 380 mm ) , but great variations are seen . The mountain ranges block the moist Pacific air , holding moisture in the western valleys , and creating rain shadows to the east . Heron , in the west , receives the most precipitation , 34.70 inches ( 881 mm ) . On the eastern ( leeward ) side of a mountain range , the valleys are much drier ; Lonepine averages 11.45 inches ( 291 mm ) , and Deer Lodge 11.00 inches ( 279 mm ) of precipitation . The mountains themselves can receive over 100 inches ( 2,500 mm ) , for example the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park gets 105 inches ( 2,700 mm ) . An area southwest of Belfry averaged only 6.59 inches ( 167 mm ) over a sixteen-year period . Most of the larger cities get 30 to 50 inches or 0.76 to 1.27 metres of snow each year . Mountain ranges themselves can accumulate 300 inches or 7.62 metres of snow during a winter . Heavy snowstorms may occur any time from September through May , though most snow falls from November to March .
PlayStation Portable can connect with PlayStation 3 in many ways , including in-game connectivity . For example , Formula One Championship Edition , a racing game , was shown at E3 2006 using a PSP as a real-time rear-view mirror . In addition , users are able to download original PlayStation format games from the PlayStation Store , transfer and play them on PSP as well as PS3 itself . It is also possible to use the Remote Play feature to play these and some PlayStation Network games , remotely on PSP over a network or internet connection .
The possibility of withdrawal depends on the terms of the treaty and its travaux preparatoire . It has , for example , been held that it is not possible to withdraw from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . When North Korea declared its intention to do this the Secretary-General of the United Nations , acting as registrar , said that original signatories of the ICCPR had not overlooked the possibility of explicitly providing for withdrawal , but rather had deliberately intended not to provide for it . Consequently , withdrawal was not possible .
To Kill a Mockingbird has been a source of significant controversy since its being the subject of classroom study as early as 1963 . The book 's racial slurs , profanity , and frank discussion of rape have led people to challenge its appropriateness in libraries and classrooms across the United States . The American Library Association reported that To Kill a Mockingbird was number 21 of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 2000–2009 .
In 1979 , the committees began the redistribution of land in the Jefara plain , continuing through 1981 . In May 1980 , measures to redistribute and equalize wealth were implemented ; anyone with over 1000 dinar in his bank account saw that extra money expropriated . The following year , the GPC announced that the government would take control of all import , export and distribution functions , with state supermarkets replacing privately owned businesses ; this led to a decline in the availability of consumer goods and the development of a thriving black market .
In the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC , the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries , as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization , converting it into a heavy industry production centre of East China . Overenthusiastic in building a “world-class” industrial city , the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development , such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal , resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s . From 1960s to 1980s there were Five Pillar Industries , namely , electronics , cars , petrochemical , iron and steel , and power , each with big state-owned firms . After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy , the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms , hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of layoff workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless .
In the north , substantial efforts were made against Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Sunderland , which were large ports on the English east coast . On 9 April 1941 Luftflotte 2 dropped 150 tons of high explosives and 50,000 incendiaries from 120 bombers in a five-hour attack . Sewer , rail , docklands , and electric installations were damaged . In Sunderland on 25 April , Luftflotte 2 sent 60 bombers which dropped 80 tons of high explosive and 9,000 incendiaries . Much damage was done . A further attack on the Clyde , this time at Greenock , took place on 6 and 7 May . However , as with the attacks in the south , the Germans failed to prevent maritime movements or cripple industry in the regions .
In music , popular local bands include The Five Stars , Penina o Tiafau and Punialava'a . The Yandall Sisters ' cover of the song Sweet Inspiration reached number one on the New Zealand charts in 1974 . King Kapisi was the first hip hop artist to receive the prestigious New Zealand APRA Silver Scroll Award in 1999 for his song Reverse Resistance . The music video for Reverse Resistance was filmed in Savai'i at his villages . Other successful Samoan hip hop artists include rapper Scribe , Dei Hamo , Savage and Tha Feelstyle whose music video Suamalie was filmed in Samoa .
In the hindgut ( element 16 in numbered diagram ) , or proctodaeum , undigested food particles are joined by uric acid to form fecal pellets . The rectum absorbs 90 % of the water in these fecal pellets , and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus ( element 17 ) , completing the process of digestion . The uric acid is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the Malpighian tubules ( element 20 ) . It is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal , at the junction between the midgut and hindgut . The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species , ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others . :71–72 , 78–80
The League of American Bicyclists gave Tucson a gold rating for bicycle friendliness in late April 2007 . Tucson hosts the largest perimeter cycling event in the United States . The ride called " El Tour de Tucson " happens in November on the Saturday before Thanksgiving . El Tour de Tucson produced and promoted by Perimeter Bicycling has as many as 10,000 participants from all over the world , annually . Tucson is one of only nine cities in the U.S. to receive a gold rating or higher for cycling friendliness from the League of American Bicyclists . The city is known for its winter cycling opportunities . Both road and mountain biking are popular in and around Tucson with trail areas including Starr Pass and Fantasy Island .
Since the end of the Second World War , France has become an ethnically diverse country . Today , approximately five percent of the French population is non-European and non-white . This does not approach the number of non-white citizens in the United States ( roughly 28–37 % , depending on how Latinos are classified ; see Demographics of the United States ) . Nevertheless , it amounts to at least three million people , and has forced the issues of ethnic diversity onto the French policy agenda . France has developed an approach to dealing with ethnic problems that stands in contrast to that of many advanced , industrialized countries . Unlike the United States , Britain , or even the Netherlands , France maintains a " color-blind " model of public policy . This means that it targets virtually no policies directly at racial or ethnic groups . Instead , it uses geographic or class criteria to address issues of social inequalities . It has , however , developed an extensive anti-racist policy repertoire since the early 1970s . Until recently , French policies focused primarily on issues of hate speech—going much further than their American counterparts—and relatively less on issues of discrimination in jobs , housing , and in provision of goods and services .
The Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) is the British government department responsible for implementing the defence policy set by Her Majesty 's Government , and is the headquarters of the British Armed Forces .
The primary site of infection in the lungs , known as the " Ghon focus " , is generally located in either the upper part of the lower lobe , or the lower part of the upper lobe . Tuberculosis of the lungs may also occur via infection from the blood stream . This is known as a Simon focus and is typically found in the top of the lung . This hematogenous transmission can also spread infection to more distant sites , such as peripheral lymph nodes , the kidneys , the brain , and the bones . All parts of the body can be affected by the disease , though for unknown reasons it rarely affects the heart , skeletal muscles , pancreas , or thyroid .
Melbourne has a highly diversified economy with particular strengths in finance , manufacturing , research , IT , education , logistics , transportation and tourism . Melbourne houses the headquarters for many of Australia 's largest corporations , including five of the ten largest in the country ( based on revenue ) , and four of the largest six in the country ( based on market capitalisation ) ( ANZ , BHP Billiton ( the world 's largest mining company ) , the National Australia Bank and Telstra ) , as well as such representative bodies and think tanks as the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Council of Trade Unions . Melbourne 's suburbs also have the Head Offices of Wesfarmers companies Coles ( including Liquorland ) , Bunnings , Target , K-Mart & Officeworks . The city is home to Australia 's largest and busiest seaport which handles more than $ 75 billion in trade every year and 39 % of the nation 's container trade . Melbourne Airport provides an entry point for national and international visitors , and is Australia 's second busiest airport . [ citation needed ]
Selenizza is a naturally occurring solid hydrocarbon bitumen found in the native asphalt deposit of Selenice , in Albania , the only European asphalt mine still in use . The rock asphalt is found in the form of veins , filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction . The bitumen content varies from 83 % to 92 % ( soluble in carbon disulphide ) , with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point ( ring & ball ) around 120 °C . The insoluble matter , consisting mainly of silica ore , ranges from 8 % to 17 % .
In addition to these institutions , Swaziland also has the Swaziland Institute of Management and Public Administration ( SIMPA ) and Institute of Development Management ( IDM ) . SIMPA is a government owned management and development institute and IDM is a regional organisation in Botswana , Lesotho and Swaziland that provides training , consultancy , and research in management . The Mananga management centre was established as Mananga Agricultural Management Centre in 1972 as an International Management Development Centre catering for middle and senior managers , it is located at Ezulwini .
Plants synthesize a number of unique polymers like the polysaccharide molecules cellulose , pectin and xyloglucan from which the land plant cell wall is constructed . Vascular land plants make lignin , a polymer used to strengthen the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels to keep them from collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress . Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibers that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood . Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record . It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period . The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today is much lower than it was when plants emerged onto land during the Ordovician and Silurian periods . Many monocots like maize and the pineapple and some dicots like the Asteraceae have since independently evolved pathways like Crassulacean acid metabolism and the C4 carbon fixation pathway for photosynthesis which avoid the losses resulting from photorespiration in the more common C3 carbon fixation pathway . These biochemical strategies are unique to land plants .
As of 2015 , the government structure of the New Delhi Municipal Council includes a chairperson , three members of New Delhi 's Legislative Assembly , two members nominated by the Chief Minister of the NCT of Delhi and five members nominated by the central government .
Detroit techno is an offshoot of Chicago house music . It was developed starting in the late 80s , one of the earliest hits being " Big Fun " by Inner City . Detroit techno developed as the legendary disc jockey The Electrifying Mojo conducted his own radio program at this time , influencing the fusion of eclectic sounds into the signature Detroit techno sound . This sound , also influenced by European electronica ( Kraftwerk , Art of Noise ) , Japanese synthpop ( Yellow Magic Orchestra ) , early B-boy Hip-Hop ( Man Parrish , Soul Sonic Force ) and Italo disco ( Doctor 's Cat , Ris , Klein M.B.O . ) , was further pioneered by Juan Atkins , Derrick May , and Kevin Saunderson , the " godfathers " of Detroit Techno .

There are some theories on emotions arguing that cognitive activity in the form of judgments , evaluations , or thoughts are necessary in order for an emotion to occur . A prominent philosophical exponent is Robert C. Solomon ( for example , The Passions , Emotions and the Meaning of Life , 1993 ) . Solomon claims that emotions are judgments . He has put forward a more nuanced view which response to what he has called the ‘standard objection’ to cognitivism , the idea that a judgment that something is fearsome can occur with or without emotion , so judgment can not be identified with emotion . The theory proposed by Nico Frijda where appraisal leads to action tendencies is another example .
In what was to become a tradition , Clarkson performed the coronation song during the finale , and released the song immediately after the season ended . The single , " A Moment Like This " , went on to break a 38-year-old record held by The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 . Guarini did not release any song immediately after the show and remains the only runner-up not to do so . Both Clarkson and Guarini made a musical film , From Justin to Kelly , which was released in 2003 but was widely panned . Clarkson has since become the most successful Idol contestant internationally , with worldwide album sales of more than 23 million .
An earthworm 's digestive system consists of a mouth , pharynx , esophagus , crop , gizzard , and intestine . The mouth is surrounded by strong lips , which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass , leaves , and weeds , with bits of soil to help chew . The lips break the food down into smaller pieces . In the pharynx , the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage . The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay . Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed . The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt . When the churning is complete , the glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste , which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter . By peristalsis , the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown . This releases carbohydrates , protein , fat , and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body .
In 1975 , the first practical solar boat was constructed in England . By 1995 , passenger boats incorporating PV panels began appearing and are now used extensively . In 1996 , Kenichi Horie made the first solar powered crossing of the Pacific Ocean , and the sun21 catamaran made the first solar powered crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in the winter of 2006–2007 . There were plans to circumnavigate the globe in 2010 .
The infinitive form ends in t ( archaically , ti ) . It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs ( for example , můžu tě slyšet— " I can hear you " ) . Czech verbs have three grammatical moods : indicative , imperative and conditional . The imperative mood adds specific endings for each of three person ( or number ) categories : -Ø/-i/-ej for second-person singular , -te/-ete/-ejte for second-person plural and -me/-eme/-ejme for first-person plural . The conditional mood is formed with a particle after the past-tense verb . This mood indicates possible events , expressed in English as " I would " or " I wish " .
The George Washington Bridge is the world 's busiest motor vehicle bridge , connecting Manhattan to Bergen County , New Jersey . The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the Americas and one of the world 's longest . The Brooklyn Bridge is an icon of the city itself . The towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are built of limestone , granite , and Rosendale cement , and their architectural style is neo-Gothic , with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers . This bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903 , and is the first steel-wire suspension bridge .
The first military unit of the Ottoman State was an army that was organized by Osman I from the tribesmen inhabiting the hills of western Anatolia in the late 13th century . The military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the Empire . The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding . The main corps of the Ottoman Army included Janissary , Sipahi , Akıncı and Mehterân . The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world , being one of the first to use muskets and cannons . The Ottoman Turks began using falconets , which were short but wide cannons , during the Siege of Constantinople . The Ottoman cavalry depended on high speed and mobility rather than heavy armour , using bows and short swords on fast Turkoman and Arabian horses ( progenitors of the Thoroughbred racing horse ) , and often applied tactics similar to those of the Mongol Empire , such as pretending to retreat while surrounding the enemy forces inside a crescent-shaped formation and then making the real attack . The decline in the army 's performance became clear from the mid-17th century and after the Great Turkish War . The 18th century saw some limited success against Venice , but in the north the European-style Russian armies forced the Ottomans to concede land .
The city has started moving away from the automobile and towards mass transit . From 2004 to 2009 , the annual number of unlinked public transportation trips increased by approximately 21 % . In 2006 , voters in King County passed proposition 2 ( Transit Now ) which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for five bus rapid transit lines called RapidRide . After rejecting a roads and transit measure in 2007 , Seattle-area voters passed a transit only measure in 2008 to increase ST Express bus service , extend the Link Light Rail system , and expand and improve Sounder commuter rail service . A light rail line from downtown heading south to Sea-Tac Airport began service on December 19 , 2009 , giving the city its first rapid transit line with intermediate stations within the city limits . An extension north to the University of Washington is scheduled to open in 2016 ; and further extensions are planned to reach Lynnwood to the north , Des Moines to the south , and Bellevue and Redmond to the east by 2023 . Former mayor Michael McGinn has supported building light rail from downtown to Ballard and West Seattle .
Tensions over rising Polish nationalism and the economic effects of the Continental System led to renewed confrontation with Russia . To enforce his blockade , Napoleon launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812 . The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic collapse of the Grand Army , forcing the French to retreat , as well as leading to the widespread destruction of Russian lands and cities . In 1813 , Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France . A chaotic military campaign in Central Europe eventually culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October . The next year , the Allies invaded France and captured Paris , forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814 . He was exiled to the island of Elba . The Bourbons were restored to power and the French lost most of the territories that they had conquered since the Revolution . However , Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of the government once again . The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition , which ultimately defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June . The Royal Navy then thwarted his planned escape to the United States in July , so he surrendered to the British after running out of other options . The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic . His death in 1821 at the age of 51 was received with shock and grief throughout Europe . In 1840 , a million people witnessed his remains returning to Paris , where they still reside at Les Invalides .
With the help of Charles Stearn , an expert on vacuum pumps , in 1878 , Swan developed a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening . This received a British Patent in 1880 . [ dubious – discuss ] On 18 December 1878 , a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown at a meeting of the Newcastle Chemical Society , and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879 . It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879 . These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament . Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current , so they were not commercially practical , although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum , a carbon conductor , and platinum lead-in wires . Besides requiring too much current for a central station electric system to be practical , they had a very short lifetime . Swan turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends . He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread ' and obtained British Patent 4933 in 1880 . From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England . His house was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power . In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity . In the early 1880s he had started his company . In 1881 , the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster , London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs , which was the first theatre , and the first public building in the world , to be lit entirely by electricity .

According to the canonical gospels , Jesus , whom Christians believe to be the Son of God as well as the Messiah ( Christ ) , was arrested , tried , and sentenced by Pontius Pilate to be scourged , and finally crucified by the Romans . Jesus was stripped of his clothing and offered wine mixed with gall to drink , before being crucified . He was then hung for six hours ( according to Mark 's Gospel ) between two convicted thieves . During this time , the soldiers affixed a sign to the top of the cross stating " Jesus of Nazareth , King of the Jews " in three languages . They then divided his garments among them , but cast lots for his seamless robe . After Jesus ' death they pierced his side with a spear to be certain that he had died . The Bible records seven statements that Jesus made while he was on the cross , as well as several supernatural events that occurred .
The group changed their name to Destiny 's Child in 1996 , based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah . In 1997 , Destiny 's Child released their major label debut song " Killing Time " on the soundtrack to the 1997 film , Men in Black . The following year , the group released their self-titled debut album , scoring their first major hit " No , No , No " . The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry , with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R & B/Soul Album of the Year , Best R & B/Soul or Rap New Artist , and Best R & B/Soul Single for " No , No , No " . The group released their multi-platinum second album The Writing 's on the Wall in 1999 . The record features some of the group 's most widely known songs such as " Bills , Bills , Bills " , the group 's first number-one single , " Jumpin ' Jumpin ' " and " Say My Name " , which became their most successful song at the time , and would remain one of their signature songs . " Say My Name " won the Best R & B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R & B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards . The Writing 's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide . During this time , Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson , an original member of Boyz II Men , on the song " After All Is Said and Done " for the soundtrack to the 1999 film , The Best Man .
Technicolor ( formerly called Thomson Consumer Electronics ) claims to control MP3 licensing of the Layer 3 patents in many countries , including the United States , Japan , Canada and EU countries . Technicolor has been actively enforcing these patents .
The earthquake had a magnitude of 8.0 Ms and 7.9 Mw . The epicenter was in Wenchuan County , Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture , 80 km west/northwest of the provincial capital of Chengdu , with its main tremor occurring at 14:28:01.42 China Standard Time ( 06:28:01.42 UTC ) , on May 12 , 2008 lasting for around 2 minutes , in the quake almost 80 % of buildings were destroyed .
On October 1 , 1989 , a peaceful demonstration of 10,000 to 15,000 people was violently dispersed by the militia in front of Lviv 's Druzhba Stadium , where a concert celebrating the Soviet " reunification " of Ukrainian lands was being held . On October 10 , Ivano-Frankivsk was the site of a pre-election protest attended by 30,000 people . On October 15 , several thousand people gathered in Chervonohrad , Chernivtsi , Rivne , and Zhytomyr ; 500 in Dnipropetrovsk ; and 30,000 in Lviv to protest the election law . On October 20 , faithful and clergy of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church participated in a synod in Lviv , the first since its forced liquidation in the 1930s .
Other pre-modern Chinese names for Tibet include Wusiguo ( Chinese : 烏斯國 ; pinyin : Wūsīguó ; cf . Tibetan dbus , Ü , [ wyʔ˨˧˨ ] ) , Wusizang ( Chinese : 烏斯藏 ; pinyin : wūsīzàng , cf . Tibetan dbus-gtsang , Ü-Tsang ) , Tubote ( Chinese : 圖伯特 ; pinyin : Túbótè ) , and Tanggute ( Chinese : 唐古忒 ; pinyin : Tánggǔtè , cf . Tangut ) . American Tibetologist Elliot Sperling has argued in favor of a recent tendency by some authors writing in Chinese to revive the term Tubote ( simplified Chinese : 图伯特 ; traditional Chinese : 圖伯特 ; pinyin : Túbótè ) for modern use in place of Xizang , on the grounds that Tubote more clearly includes the entire Tibetan plateau rather than simply the Tibet Autonomous Region .

Following the announcement of Nasser 's death , Egypt and the Arab world were in a state of shock . Nasser 's funeral procession through Cairo on 1 October was attended by at least five million mourners . The 10-kilometer ( 6.2 mi ) procession to his burial site began at the old RCC headquarters with a flyover by MiG-21 jets . His flag-draped coffin was attached to a gun carriage pulled by six horses and led by a column of cavalrymen . All Arab heads of state attended , with the exception of Saudi King Faisal . King Hussein and Arafat cried openly , and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya fainted from emotional distress twice . A few major non-Arab dignitaries were present , including Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin and French Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas .
The epidermis is typically 10 to 30 cells thick ; its main function is to provide a waterproof layer . Its outermost cells are constantly lost ; its bottommost cells are constantly dividing and pushing upward . The middle layer , the dermis , is 15 to 40 times thicker than the epidermis . The dermis is made up of many components , such as bony structures and blood vessels . The hypodermis is made up of adipose tissue . Its job is to store lipids , and to provide cushioning and insulation . The thickness of this layer varies widely from species to species .
Insects can be divided into two groups historically treated as subclasses : wingless insects , known as Apterygota , and winged insects , known as Pterygota . The Apterygota consist of the primitively wingless order of the silverfish ( Thysanura ) . Archaeognatha make up the Monocondylia based on the shape of their mandibles , while Thysanura and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia . The Thysanura themselves possibly are not monophyletic , with the family Lepidotrichidae being a sister group to the Dicondylia ( Pterygota and the remaining Thysanura ) .
Prior to Einstein 's paper , electromagnetic radiation such as visible light was considered to behave as a wave : hence the use of the terms " frequency " and " wavelength " to characterise different types of radiation . The energy transferred by a wave in a given time is called its intensity . The light from a theatre spotlight is more intense than the light from a domestic lightbulb ; that is to say that the spotlight gives out more energy per unit time and per unit space ( and hence consumes more electricity ) than the ordinary bulb , even though the colour of the light might be very similar . Other waves , such as sound or the waves crashing against a seafront , also have their own intensity . However , the energy account of the photoelectric effect did n't seem to agree with the wave description of light .
Chasetown , whilst playing at Level 8 of English football during the 2007–08 competition , are the lowest-ranked team to play in the Third Round Proper ( final 64 , of 731 teams entered that season ) . Chasetown was then a member of the Southern League Division One Midlands ( a lower level within the Southern Football League ) , when they lost to Football League Championship ( Level 2 ) team Cardiff City , the eventual FA Cup runners-up that year . Their success earned the lowly organisation over £60,000 in prize money .
New York City traces its roots to its 1624 founding as a trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 1626 . The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 . New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790 . It has been the country 's largest city since 1790 . The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a globally recognized symbol of the United States and its democracy .
In the 2005–06 season , Barcelona repeated their league and Supercup successes . The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid . It was Frank Rijkaard 's second victory at the Bernabéu , making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice . Ronaldinho 's performance was so impressive that after his second goal , which was Barcelona 's third , some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation . In the Champions League , Barcelona beat the English club Arsenal in the final . Trailing 1–0 to a 10-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining , they came back to win 2–1 , with substitute Henrik Larsson , in his final appearance for the club , setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti , for the club 's first European Cup victory in 14 years .
The person or organization submits a HCP and if approved by the agency ( FWS or NMFS ) , will be issued an Incidental Take Permit ( ITP ) which allows a certain number of " takes " of the listed species . The permit may be revoked at any time and can allow incidental takes for varying amounts of time . For instance , the San Bruno Habitat Conservation Plan/ Incidental Take Permit is good for 30 years and the Wal-Mart store ( in Florida ) permit expires after one year . Because the permit is issued by a federal agency to a private party , it is a federal action-which means other federal laws can apply , such as the National Environmental Policy Act or NEPA . A notice of the permit application action is published in the Federal Register and a public comment period of 30 to 90 days begins .
Racial discrimination continued to be enacted in new laws in the 20th century , for instance the one-drop rule was enacted in Virginia 's 1924 Racial Integrity Law and in other southern states , in part influenced by the popularity of eugenics and ideas of racial purity . People buried fading memories that many whites had multiracial ancestry . Many families were multiracial . Similar laws had been proposed but not passed in the late nineteenth century in South Carolina and Virginia , for instance . After regaining political power in Southern states by disenfranchising blacks , white Democrats passed laws to impose Jim Crow and racial segregation to restore white supremacy . They maintained these until forced to change in the 1960s and after by enforcement of federal legislation authorizing oversight of practices to protect the constitutional rights of African Americans and other minority citizens .
On September 23 , 1908 , the Cubs and New York Giants were involved in a tight pennant race . The two clubs were tied in the bottom of the ninth inning at the Polo Grounds , and N.Y. had runners on first and third and two outs when Al Bridwell singled , scoring Moose McCormick from third with the Giants ' apparent winning run , but the runner on first base , rookie Fred Merkle , left the field without touching second base . As fans swarmed the field , Cub infielder Johnny Evers retrieved the ball and touched second . Since there were two outs , a forceout was called at second base , ending the inning and the game . Because of the tie the Giants and Cubs ended up tied for first place . The Giants lost the ensuing one-game playoff and the Cubs went on to the World Series .
American Idol has traditionally released studio recordings of contestants ' performances as well as the winner 's coronation single for sale . For the first five seasons , the recordings were released as a compilation album at the end of the season . All five of these albums reached the top ten in Billboard 200 which made then American Idol the most successful soundtrack franchise of any motion picture or television program . Starting late in season five , individual performances were released during the season as digital downloads , initially from the American Idol official website only . In season seven the live performances and studio recordings were made available during the season from iTunes when it joined as a sponsor . In Season ten the weekly studio recordings were also released as compilation digital album straight after performance night .
Milena Sterio , American expert of international law , includes the former axis powers ( Germany , Italy and Japan ) and India among the great powers along with the permanent members of the UNSC . She considers Germany , Japan and Italy to be great powers due to their G7 membership and because of their influence in regional and international organizations . Various authors describe Italy as an equal major power , while others view Italy as an " intermittent great power " or as " the least of the great powers " .
Lighthouse Point Park , a public beach run by the city , was a popular tourist destination during the Roaring Twenties , attracting luminaries of the period such as Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb . The park remains popular among New Haveners , and is home to the Five Mile Point Lighthouse , constructed in 1847 , and the Lighthouse Point Carousel , constructed in 1916 . Five Mile Point Light was decommissioned in 1877 following the construction of Southwest Ledge Light at the entrance of the harbor , which remains in service to this day . Both of the lighthouses and the carousel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .
All the electromagnetic motors , and that includes the types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector product of the interacting fields . For calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the air gap . Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using FEA or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector . The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current . This makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed .
Baptist missionary work in Canada began in the British colony of Nova Scotia ( present day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick ) in the 1760s . The first official record of a Baptist church in Canada was that of the Horton Baptist Church ( now Wolfville ) in Wolfville , Nova Scotia on 29 October 1778 . The church was established with the assistance of the New Light evangelist Henry Alline . Many of Alline 's followers , after his death , would convert and strengthen the Baptist presence in the Atlantic region . [ page needed ] Two major groups of Baptists formed the basis of the churches in the Maritimes . These were referred to as Regular Baptist ( Calvinistic in their doctrine ) and Free Will Baptists .
A local pioneer of folk song collection in the first half of the 19th century was Shakespearean scholar James Orchard Halliwell , but it was not until the second folk revival in the 20th century that the full range of song from the county , including industrial folk song , began to gain attention . The county produced one of the major figures of the revival in Ewan MacColl , but also a local champion in Harry Boardman , who from 1965 onwards probably did more than anyone to popularise and record the folk song of the county . Perhaps the most influential folk artists to emerge from the region in the late 20th century were Liverpool folk group The Spinners , and from Manchester folk troubadour Roy Harper and musician , comedian and broadcaster Mike Harding . The region is home to numerous folk clubs , many of them catering to Irish and Scottish folk music . Regular folk festivals include the Fylde Folk Festival at Fleetwood .
Like other settled , agrarian societies in history , those in the Indian subcontinent have been attacked by nomadic tribes throughout its long history . In evaluating the impact of Islam on the sub-continent , one must note that the northwestern sub-continent was a frequent target of tribes raiding from Central Asia . In that sense , the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions were not dissimilar to those of the earlier invasions during the 1st millennium . What does however , make the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions different is that unlike the preceding invaders who assimilated into the prevalent social system , the successful Muslim conquerors retained their Islamic identity and created new legal and administrative systems that challenged and usually in many cases superseded the existing systems of social conduct and ethics , even influencing the non-Muslim rivals and common masses to a large extent , though non-Muslim population was left to their own laws and customs . They also introduced new cultural codes that in some ways were very different from the existing cultural codes . This led to the rise of a new Indian culture which was mixed in nature , though different from both the ancient Indian culture and later westernized modern Indian culture . At the same time it must be noted that overwhelming majority of Muslims in India are Indian natives converted to Islam . This factor also played an important role in the synthesis of cultures .
Guam ( i/ˈɡwɑːm/ or /ˈɡwɒm/ ; Chamorro : Guåhån ; [ needs IPA ] formally the Territory of Guam ) is an unincorporated and organized territory of the United States . Located in the northwestern Pacific Ocean , Guam is one of five American territories with an established civilian government . The capital city is Hagåtña , and the most populous city is Dededo . In 2015 , 161,785 people resided on Guam . Guamanians are American citizens by birth . Guam has an area of 544 km2 ( 210 sq mi ) and a density of 297/km² ( 770/sq mi ) . It is the largest and southernmost of the Mariana Islands , and the largest island in Micronesia . Among its municipalities , Mongmong-Toto-Maite has the highest density at 1,425/km² ( 3,691/sq mi ) , whereas Inarajan and Umatac have the lowest density at 47/km² ( 119/sq mi ) . The highest point is Mount Lamlam at 406 meters ( 1,332 ft ) above sea level .
An example of the first view is the regulation of attorneys and judges , and the establishment of rules for the conduct of the courts , by the Congress and in the states the legislatures . Although in practice these matters are delegated to the Supreme Court , the Congress holds these powers and delegates them to the Supreme Court only for convenience in light of the Supreme Court 's expertise , but can withdraw that delegation at any time .
North Carolina Museum of Art , occupying a large suburban campus on Blue Ridge Road near the North Carolina State Fairgrounds , maintains one of the premier public art collections located between Washington , D.C. , and Atlanta . In addition to its extensive collections of American Art , European Art and ancient art , the museum recently has hosted major exhibitions featuring Auguste Rodin ( in 2000 ) and Claude Monet ( in 2006-07 ) , each attracting more than 200,000 visitors . Unlike most prominent public museums , the North Carolina Museum of Art acquired a large number of the works in its permanent collection through purchases with public funds . The museum 's outdoor park is one of the largest such art parks in the country . The museum facility underwent a major expansion which greatly expanded the exhibit space that was completed in 2010 . The 127,000 sf new expansion is designed by NYC architect Thomas Phifer and Partners .
The Axis states which assisted Japan included the authoritarian government of Thailand in World War II , which quickly formed a temporary alliance with the Japanese in 1941 , as the Japanese forces were already invading the peninsula of southern Thailand . The Phayap Army sent troops to invade and occupy northeastern Burma , which was former Thai territory that had been annexed by Britain much earlier . Also involved were the Japanese puppet states of Manchukuo and Mengjiang ( consisting of most of Manchuria and parts of Inner Mongolia respectively ) , and the collaborationist Wang Jingwei regime ( which controlled the coastal regions of China ) .
The following year , when Philip Graves , the Constantinople ( modern Istanbul ) correspondent of The Times , exposed The Protocols as a forgery , The Times retracted the editorial of the previous year .
This age saw the Greeks move towards larger cities and a reduction in the importance of the city-state . These larger cities were parts of the still larger Kingdoms of the Diadochi . Greeks , however , remained aware of their past , chiefly through the study of the works of Homer and the classical authors . An important factor in maintaining Greek identity was contact with barbarian ( non-Greek ) peoples , which was deepened in the new cosmopolitan environment of the multi-ethnic Hellenistic kingdoms . This led to a strong desire among Greeks to organize the transmission of the Hellenic paideia to the next generation . Greek science , technology and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period .
Microsoft Windows 3.0 was released in May 1990 , and according to a common saying at the time " Windows was not as good as Macintosh , but it was good enough for the average user " . Though still a graphical wrapper that relied upon MS-DOS , 3.0 was the first iteration of Windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the much more expensive Macintosh platform . It also did not help matters that during the previous year Jean-Louis Gassée had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers . Finally , there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding PC industry in 1989 , forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices which dropped Apple 's margins .
Under the early courts , when military conscription had been centrally controlled , military affairs had been taken out of the hands of the provincial aristocracy . But as the system broke down after 792 , local power holders again became the primary source of military strength . The re-establishment of an efficient military system was made gradually through a process of trial-and-error . At that time the imperial court did not possess an army but rather relied on an organization of professional warriors composed mainly of oryoshi , which were appointed to an individual province and tsuibushi , which were appointed over imperial circuits or for specific tasks . This gave rise to the Japanese military class . Nonetheless final authority rested with the imperial court .
Victoria visited mainland Europe regularly for holidays . In 1889 , during a stay in Biarritz , she became the first reigning monarch from Britain to set foot in Spain when she crossed the border for a brief visit . By April 1900 , the Boer War was so unpopular in mainland Europe that her annual trip to France seemed inadvisable . Instead , the Queen went to Ireland for the first time since 1861 , in part to acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war . In July , her second son Alfred ( " Affie " ) died ; " Oh , God ! My poor darling Affie gone too " , she wrote in her journal . " It is a horrible year , nothing but sadness & horrors of one kind & another . "
BYU has been considered by some Latter-day Saints , as well as some university and church leaders , to be " The Lord 's university " . This phrase is used in reference to the school 's mission as an " ambassador " to the world for the LDS Church and thus , for Jesus Christ . In the past , some students and faculty have expressed dissatisfaction with this nickname , stating that it gives students the idea that university authorities are always divinely inspired and never to be contradicted . Leaders of the school , however , acknowledge that the nickname represents more a goal that the university strives for and not its current state of being . Leaders encourage students and faculty to help fulfill the goal by following the teachings of their religion , adhering to the school 's honor code , and serving others with the knowledge they gain while attending .
The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals . Only a few invertebrates such as sponges , jellyfish , adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain ; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead . The brain is located in the head , usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision , hearing , balance , taste , and smell . The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate 's body . In a typical human , the cerebral cortex ( the largest part ) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons , each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons . These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons , which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells .
The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction until late in the 20th century , replacing the phonograph cylinder record–with which it had co-existed from the late 1880s through to the 1920s–by the late 1920s . Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as compact cassette were mass-marketed . By the late 1980s , digital media , in the form of the compact disc , had gained a larger market share , and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991 . From the 1990s to the 2010s , records continued to be manufactured and sold on a much smaller scale , and were especially used by disc jockeys ( DJ ) s , released by artists in some genres , and listened to by a niche market of audiophiles . The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century – 9.2 million records were sold in the U.S. in 2014 , a 260 % increase since 2009 . Likewise , in the UK sales have increased five-fold from 2009 to 2014 .
Canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as Venezuelan extra-heavy and Mexican heavy oil in chemical composition , and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through oil pipelines to the refinery . Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline , diesel fuel , and refined asphalt without any preprocessing . This is particularly common in areas such as the US Gulf coast , where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil , and in areas such as the US Midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined . Given the choice , such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower , and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline . By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over 1.3 million barrels ( 210×10^3 m3 ) per day , of which about 65 % was exported to the United States .
On October 21 , 2008 , Apple reported that only 14.21 % of total revenue for fiscal quarter 4 of year 2008 came from iPods . At the September 9 , 2009 keynote presentation at the Apple Event , Phil Schiller announced total cumulative sales of iPods exceeded 220 million . The continual decline of iPod sales since 2009 has not been a surprising trend for the Apple corporation , as Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer explained in June 2009 : " We expect our traditional MP3 players to decline over time as we cannibalize ourselves with the iPod Touch and the iPhone . " Since 2009 , the company 's iPod sales have continually decreased every financial quarter and in 2013 a new model was not introduced onto the market .
Saint Helena has a 10/3.6 Mbit/s internet link via Intelsat 707 provided by SURE . Serving a population of more than 4,000 , this single satellite link is considered inadequate in terms of bandwidth .
Beginning in the late 1950s and 1960s , architectural phenomenology emerged as an important movement in the early reaction against modernism , with architects like Charles Moore in the USA , Christian Norberg-Schulz in Norway , and Ernesto Nathan Rogers and Vittorio Gregotti in Italy , who collectively popularized an interest in a new contemporary architecture aimed at expanding human experience using historical buildings as models and precedents . Postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials , with the aesthetics of older pre-modern and non-modern styles , from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles . Robert Venturi famously defined postmodern architecture as a " decorated shed " ( an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside ) , and upheld it against modernist and brutalist " ducks " ( buildings with unnecessarily expressive tectonic forms ) .
The thalidomide tragedy resurrected Kefauver 's bill to enhance drug regulation that had stalled in Congress , and the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962 . Manufacturers henceforth had to prove to FDA that their drugs were effective as well as safe before they could go on the US market . The FDA received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices . The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective . An FDA - National Academy of Sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective . A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later .
Despite the dominance of the above formula , there are documented attempts of the financial industry , occurring before the crisis , to address the formula limitations , specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events . The volume " Credit Correlation : Life After Copulas " , published in 2007 by World Scientific , summarizes a 2006 conference held by Merrill Lynch in London where several practitioners attempted to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations . See also the article by Donnelly and Embrechts and the book by Brigo , Pallavicini and Torresetti , that reports relevant warnings and research on CDOs appeared in 2006 .
Tajikistan ( i/tɑːˈdʒiːkᵻstɑːn/ , /təˈdʒiːkᵻstæn/ , or /tæˈdʒiːkiːstæn/ ; Persian : تاجيكستان‎‎ Тоҷикистон [ tɔd͡ʒikɪsˈtɔn ] ) , officially the Republic of Tajikistan ( Persian : جمهورى تاجيكستان‎‎ Tajik : Ҷумҳурии Тоҷикистон , Çumhuriji Toçikiston/Jumhuriyi Tojikiston ; Russian : Респу́блика Таджикистан , Respublika Tadzhikistan ) , is a mountainous , landlocked country in Central Asia with an estimated 8 million people in 2013 , and an area of 143,100 km2 ( 55,300 sq mi ) . It is bordered by Afghanistan to the south , Uzbekistan to the west , Kyrgyzstan to the north , and China to the east . Pakistan lies to the south , separated by the narrow Wakhan Corridor . Traditional homelands of Tajik people included present-day Tajikistan , Afghanistan and Uzbekistan .
Alternatively , or in addition to this practice , the members of an upper house may be indirectly elected by the government or legislature of the component states , as occurred in the United States prior to 1913 , or be actual members or delegates of the state governments , as , for example , is the case in the German Bundesrat and in the Council of the European Union . The lower house of a federal legislature is usually directly elected , with apportionment in proportion to population , although states may sometimes still be guaranteed a certain minimum number of seats .
Internationally , Victoria took a keen interest in the improvement of relations between France and Britain . She made and hosted several visits between the British royal family and the House of Orleans , who were related by marriage through the Coburgs . In 1843 and 1845 , she and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe I at château d'Eu in Normandy ; she was the first British or English monarch to visit a French one since the meeting of Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520 . When Louis Philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844 , he became the first French king to visit a British sovereign . Louis Philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848 , and fled to exile in England . At the height of a revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848 , Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of Osborne House , a private estate on the Isle of Wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped . Demonstrations by Chartists and Irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support , and the scare died down without any major disturbances . Victoria 's first visit to Ireland in 1849 was a public relations success , but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of Irish nationalism .
At least a few insects have nociceptors , cells that detect and transmit sensations of pain . This was discovered in 2003 by studying the variation in reactions of larvae of the common fruitfly Drosophila to the touch of a heated probe and an unheated one . The larvae reacted to the touch of the heated probe with a stereotypical rolling behavior that was not exhibited when the larvae were touched by the unheated probe . Although nociception has been demonstrated in insects , there is no consensus that insects feel pain consciously
A Misratan militia took Gaddafi prisoner , beating him , causing serious injuries ; the events were filmed on a mobile phone . A video appears to picture Gaddafi being poked or stabbed in the rear end " with some kind of stick or knife " or possibly a bayonet . Pulled onto the front of a pick-up truck , he fell off as it drove away . His semi-naked , lifeless body was then placed into an ambulance and taken to Misrata ; upon arrival , he was found to be dead . Official NTC accounts claimed that Gaddafi was caught in a cross-fire and died from his bullet wounds . Other eye-witness accounts claimed that rebels had fatally shot Gaddafi in the stomach ; a rebel identifying himself as Senad el-Sadik el-Ureybi later claimed responsibility . Gaddafi 's son Mutassim , who had also been among the convoy , was also captured , and found dead several hours later , most probably from an extrajudicial execution . Around 140 Gaddafi loyalists were rounded up from the convoy ; tied up and abused , the corpses of 66 were found at the nearby Mahari Hotel , victims of extrajudicial execution . Libya 's chief forensic pathologist , Dr. Othman al-Zintani , carried out the autopsies of Gaddafi , his son and Jabr in the days following their deaths ; although the pathologist initially told the press that Gaddafi had died from a gunshot wound to the head , the autopsy report was not made public .
The Institute also maintains a dozen regional offices around the United Kingdom , it opened its first regional office for the East of England at Cambridge in 1966 .
Sony Music Entertainment Inc.

Traditionally a carnival feast was the last opportunity to eat well before the time of food shortage at the end of the winter during which one was limited to the minimum necessary . On what nowadays is called vastenavond ( the days before fasting ) all the remaining winter stores of lard , butter and meat which were left would be eaten , for it would soon start to rot and decay . The selected livestock had in fact already been slaughtered in November and the meat would be no longer preservable . All the food that had survived the winter had to be eaten to assure that everyone was fed enough to survive until the coming spring would provide new food sources .
" Data on ethnic groups are important for putting into effect a number of federal statutes ( i.e. , enforcing bilingual election rules under the Voting Rights Act ; monitoring and enforcing equal employment opportunities under the Civil Rights Act ) . Data on Ethnic Groups are also needed by local governments to run programs and meet legislative requirements ( i.e. , identifying segments of the population who may not be receiving medical services under the Public Health Act ; evaluating whether financial institutions are meeting the credit needs of minority populations under the Community Reinvestment Act ) . "
In 1968 , Tito offered Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubček to fly to Prague on three hours notice if Dubček needed help in facing down the Soviets . In April 1969 , Tito removed generals Ivan Gošnjak and Rade Hamović in the aftermath of the invasion of Czechoslovakia due to the unpreparedness of the Yugoslav army to respond to a similar invasion of Yugoslavia .
After the defeat of the Confederacy , federal forces remained in Charleston during the city 's reconstruction . The war had shattered the prosperity of the antebellum city . Freed slaves were faced with poverty and discrimination , but a large community of free people of color had been well-established in the city before the war and became the leaders of the postwar Republican Party and its legislators . Men who had been free people of color before the war comprised 26 % of those elected to state and federal office in South Carolina from 1868 to 1876 .
In the period before German colonisation , Samoa produced mostly copra . German merchants and settlers were active in introducing large scale plantation operations and developing new industries , notably cocoa bean and rubber , relying on imported labourers from China and Melanesia . When the value of natural rubber fell drastically , about the end of the Great War ( World War I ) , the New Zealand government encouraged the production of bananas , for which there is a large market in New Zealand .

Each year HHC 's facilities provide about 225,000 admissions , one million emergency room visits and five million clinic visits to New Yorkers . HHC facilities treat nearly one-fifth of all general hospital discharges and more than one third of emergency room and hospital-based clinic visits in New York City .
In 1928 , Nasser went to Alexandria to live with his maternal grandfather and attend the city 's Attarin elementary school . He left in 1929 for a private boarding school in Helwan , and later returned to Alexandria to enter the Ras el-Tin secondary school and to join his father , who was working for the city 's postal service . It was in Alexandria that Nasser became involved in political activism . After witnessing clashes between protesters and police in Manshia Square , he joined the demonstration without being aware of its purpose . The protest , organized by the ultranationalist Young Egypt Society , called for the end of colonialism in Egypt in the wake of the 1923 Egyptian constitution 's annulment by Prime Minister Isma'il Sidqi . Nasser was arrested and detained for a night before his father bailed him out .
In addition to basic uniform clothing , various badges are used by the USAF to indicate a billet assignment or qualification-level for a given assignment . Badges can also be used as merit-based or service-based awards . Over time , various badges have been discontinued and are no longer distributed . Authorized badges include the Shields of USAF Fire Protection , and Security Forces , and the Missile Badge ( or " pocket rocket " ) , which is earned after working in a missile system maintenance or missile operations capacity for at least one year .
In late 1994 , Marvel acquired the comic book distributor Heroes World Distribution to use as its own exclusive distributor . As the industry 's other major publishers made exclusive distribution deals with other companies , the ripple effect resulted in the survival of only one other major distributor in North America , Diamond Comic Distributors Inc . In early 1997 , when Marvel 's Heroes World endeavor failed , Diamond also forged an exclusive deal with Marvel—giving the company its own section of its comics catalog Previews .
By spring 1950 , Stalin believed the strategic situation had changed . The Soviets had detonated their first nuclear bomb in September 1949 ; American soldiers had fully withdrawn from Korea ; the Americans had not intervened to stop the communist victory in China , and Stalin calculated that the Americans would be even less willing to fight in Korea—which had seemingly much less strategic significance . The Soviets had also cracked the codes used by the US to communicate with the US embassy in Moscow , and reading these dispatches convinced Stalin that Korea did not have the importance to the US that would warrant a nuclear confrontation . Stalin began a more aggressive strategy in Asia based on these developments , including promising economic and military aid to China through the Sino–Soviet Friendship , Alliance , and Mutual Assistance Treaty .
Special bundles of the game contain a Wolf Link Amiibo figurine , which unlocks a Wii U-exclusive dungeon called the " Cave of Shadows " and can carry data over to the upcoming 2016 Zelda game .

Even though the Gelug exchanged gifts with and sent missions to the Ming court up until the 1430s , the Gelug was not mentioned in the Mingshi or the Mingshi Lu . On this , historian Li Tieh-tseng says of Tsongkhapa 's refusal of Ming invitations to visit the Yongle Emperor 's court :
Support for the U.S. cooled when America made clear its determination to invade Iraq in late 2002 . Even so , many of the " coalition of the willing " countries that unconditionally supported the U.S.-led military action have sent troops to Afghanistan , particular neighboring Pakistan , which has disowned its earlier support for the Taliban and contributed tens of thousands of soldiers to the conflict . Pakistan was also engaged in the War in North-West Pakistan ( Waziristan War ) . Supported by U.S. intelligence , Pakistan was attempting to remove the Taliban insurgency and al-Qaeda element from the northern tribal areas .
The experience of pain has many cultural dimensions . For instance , the way in which one experiences and responds to pain is related to sociocultural characteristics , such as gender , ethnicity , and age . An aging adult may not respond to pain in the way that a younger person would . Their ability to recognize pain may be blunted by illness or the use of multiple prescription drugs . Depression may also keep the older adult from reporting they are in pain . The older adult may also quit doing activities they love because it hurts too much . Decline in self-care activities ( dressing , grooming , walking , etc . ) may also be indicators that the older adult is experiencing pain . The older adult may refrain from reporting pain because they are afraid they will have to have surgery or will be put on a drug they might become addicted to . They may not want others to see them as weak , or may feel there is something impolite or shameful in complaining about pain , or they may feel the pain is deserved punishment for past transgressions .
Gaddafi briefly studied History at the University of Libya in Benghazi , before dropping out to join the military . Despite his police record , in 1963 he began training at the Royal Military Academy , Benghazi , alongside several like-minded friends from Misrata . The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged Libyans , and Gaddafi recognised it as a potential instrument of political change . Under Idris , Libya 's armed forces were trained by the British military ; this angered Gaddafi , who viewed the British as imperialists , and accordingly he refused to learn English and was rude to the British officers , ultimately failing his exams . British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour , stating their suspicion that he was involved in the assassination of the military academy 's commander in 1963 . Such reports were ignored and Gaddafi quickly progressed through the course .
Among the notable structures in the town are the three forts built by the Swedes for defense purposes . One of these forts , known as Fort Oscar ( formerly Gustav Adolph ) , which overlooks the sea is located on the far side of La Pointe . However , the ruins have been replaced by a modern military building which now houses the local gendarmerie . The other fort known as Fort Karl now presents a very few ruins . The third fort built by the Swedes is the Fort Gustav , which is also seen in ruins strewn around the weather station and the Light House . The fort built in 1787 over a hill slope has ruins of ramparts , guardhouse , munitions depot , wood-burning oven and so forth .

The American Civil War caught both sides unprepared . The Confederacy hoped to win by getting Britain and France to intervene , or else by wearing down the North 's willingness to fight . The U.S. sought a quick victory focused on capturing the Confederate capital at Richmond , Virginia . The Confederates under Robert E. Lee tenaciously defended their capital until the very end . The war spilled across the continent , and even to the high seas . Most of the material and personnel of the South were used up , while the North prospered .
Copper-alloy touch surfaces have natural intrinsic properties to destroy a wide range of microorganisms ( e.g. , E. coli O157 : H7 , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , Staphylococcus , Clostridium difficile , influenza A virus , adenovirus , and fungi ) . Some 355 copper alloys were proven to kill more than 99.9 % of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly . The United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has approved the registrations of these copper alloys as " antimicrobial materials with public health benefits , " which allows manufacturers to legally make claims as to the positive public health benefits of products made with registered antimicrobial copper alloys . In addition , the EPA has approved a long list of antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys , such as bedrails , handrails , over-bed tables , sinks , faucets , door knobs , toilet hardware , computer keyboards , health club equipment , shopping cart handles , etc . ( for a comprehensive list of products , see : Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces # Approved products ) . Copper doorknobs are used by hospitals to reduce the transfer of disease , and Legionnaires ' disease is suppressed by copper tubing in plumbing systems . Antimicrobial copper alloy products are now being installed in healthcare facilities in the U.K. , Ireland , Japan , Korea , France , Denmark , and Brazil [ citation needed ] and in the subway transit system in Santiago , Chile , where copper-zinc alloy handrails will be installed in some 30 stations between 2011–2014 .
Prior to 1871 , the government of the United States regularly entered into treaties with Native Americans but the Indian Appropriations Act of March 3 , 1871 ( ch . 120 , 16 Stat . 563 ) had a rider ( 25 U.S.C . § 71 ) attached that effectively ended the President’s treaty making by providing that no Indian nation or tribe shall be acknowledged as an independent nation , tribe , or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty . The federal government continued to provide similar contractual relations with the Indian tribes after 1871 by agreements , statutes , and executive orders .

The dynasty lost control of peripheral territories bit by bit . In return for promises of support against the British and the French , the Russian Empire took large chunks of territory in the Northeast in 1860 . The period of cooperation between the reformers and the European powers ended with the Tientsin Massacre of 1870 , which was incited by the murder of French nuns set off by the belligerence of local French diplomats . Starting with the Cochinchina Campaign in 1858 , France expanded control of Indochina . By 1883 , France was in full control of the region and had reached the Chinese border . The Sino-French War began with a surprise attack by the French on the Chinese southern fleet at Fuzhou . After that the Chinese declared war on the French . A French invasion of Taiwan was halted and the French were defeated on land in Tonkin at the Battle of Bang Bo . However Japan threatened to enter the war against China due to the Gapsin Coup and China chose to end the war with negotiations . The war ended in 1885 with the Treaty of Tientsin ( 1885 ) and the Chinese recognition of the French protectorate in Vietnam .
As of January 1 , 2008 estimates by the San Diego Association of Governments revealed that the household median income for San Diego rose to $ 66,715 , up from $ 45,733 , and that the city population rose to 1,336,865 , up 9.3 % from 2000 . The population was 45.3 % non-Hispanic whites , down from 78.9 % in 1970 , 27.7 % Hispanics , 15.6 % Asians/Pacific Islanders , 7.1 % blacks , 0.4 % American Indians , and 3.9 % from other races . Median age of Hispanics was 27.5 years , compared to 35.1 years overall and 41.6 years among non-Hispanic whites ; Hispanics were the largest group in all ages under 18 , and non-Hispanic whites constituted 63.1 % of population 55 and older .
There are facilities across the country with research rooms , archival holdings , and microfilms of documents of federal agencies and courts pertinent to each region .
In turn , according to Kozinski 's analysis , the contemporary rule of binding precedent became possible in the U.S. in the nineteenth century only after the creation of a clear court hierarchy ( under the Judiciary Acts ) , and the beginning of regular verbatim publication of U.S. appellate decisions by West Publishing . The rule gradually developed , case-by-case , as an extension of the judiciary 's public policy of effective judicial administration ( that is , in order to efficiently exercise the judicial power ) . The rule of precedent is generally justified today as a matter of public policy , first , as a matter of fundamental fairness , and second , because in the absence of case law , it would be completely unworkable for every minor issue in every legal case to be briefed , argued , and decided from first principles ( such as relevant statutes , constitutional provisions , and underlying public policies ) , which in turn would create hopeless inefficiency , instability , and unpredictability , and thereby undermine the rule of law .
All the major British cities had flourishing department stores by the mid-or late nineteenth century . Increasingly , women became the major shoppers and middle-class households . Kendals ( formerly Kendal Milne & Faulkner ) in Manchester lays claim to being one of the first department stores and is still known to many of its customers as Kendal 's , despite its 2005 name change to House of Fraser . The Manchester institution dates back to 1836 but had been trading as Watts Bazaar since 1796 . At its zenith the store had buildings on both sides of Deansgate linked by a subterranean passage " Kendals Arcade " and an art nouveau tiled food hall . The store was especially known for its emphasis on quality and style over low prices giving it the nickname " the Harrods of the North " , although this was due in part to Harrods acquiring the store in 1919 . Other large Manchester stores included Paulden 's ( currently Debenhams ) and Lewis 's ( now a Primark ) .
Many were surprised by these changes to the CBC schedule , which were apparently intended to attract a younger audience to the network ; some suggested they might alienate the core CBC viewership . Another note of criticism was made when the network decided to move The National in some time zones to simulcast the American version of The One over the summer . This later became a moot point , as The One was taken off the air after two weeks after extremely low American and Canadian ratings , and the newscast resumed its regular schedule .
In the vaulting events , gymnasts sprint down a 25 metres ( 82 ft ) runway , jump onto a spring filled board or perform a roundoff , or handspring entry onto a springboard ( run/ take-off segment ) , land momentarily , inverted on the hands on the vaulting horse , or vaulting table ( pre flight segment ) , then propel themselves forward or backward , off of this platform to a two footed landing ( post flight segment ) . Every gymnast starts at a different point on the vault runway depending on their height and strength . The post flight segment may include one or more multiple saltos or somersaults , and/or twisting movements . A round-off entry vault , called a Yurchenko , is the most common vault in elite level gymnastics . When performing a yurchenko , gymnasts " round-off " so hands are on the runway while the feet land on the springboard ( beatboard ) . From the roundoff position the gymnast travels backwards and executes a backhandspring so that the hands land on the vaulting table . The gymnast then blocks off the vaulting platform into various twisting and/or somersaulting combinations . The post flight segment brings the gymnast to her feet .
To prevent piracy of films , the standard drill of film distribution is to have a movie first released through movie theaters ( theatrical window ) , on average approximately 16 and a half weeks , before having it released to Blu-Ray and DVD ( entering its video window ) . During the theatrical window , digital versions of films are often transported in data storage devices by couriers rather than by data transmission . The data can be encrypted , with the key being made to work only at specific times in order to prevent leakage between screens . Coded Anti-Piracy marks can be added to films to identify the source of illegal copies and shut them down . As a result of these measures , the only versions of films available for piracy during the theatrical window are usually " cams " made by video recordings of the movie screens , which are of inferior quality compared to the original film version .
Elizabeth I of England , primarily interested in trade with the east , collaborated with English merchants to form the first trading companies to the far-flung regions , using their own jargon . Their goals were to obtain trading concessions by treaty . The queen chartered the Company of Merchants of the Levant , shortened to Levant Company , and soon known also as The Turkey Company , in 1581 . In 1582 , the ship The Great Susan transported the first ambassador , William Harebone , to the Ottoman Porte ( government of the Ottoman Empire ) at Constantinople . Compared to Anatolia , Levant also means " land of the rising sun , " but where Anatolia always only meant the projection of land currently occupied by the Republic of Turkey , Levant meant anywhere in the domain ruled by the Ottoman Porte . The East India Company ( short for a much longer formal name ) was chartered in 1600 for trade to the East Indies .
The Supermarine Spitfire was designed and developed in Southampton , evolving from the Schneider trophy-winning seaplanes of the 1920s and 1930s . Its designer , R J Mitchell , lived in the Portswood area of Southampton , and his house is today marked with a blue plaque . Heavy bombing of the factory in September 1940 destroyed it as well as homes in the vicinity , killing civilians and workers . World War II hit Southampton particularly hard because of its strategic importance as a major commercial port and industrial area . Prior to the Invasion of Europe , components for a Mulberry harbour were built here . After D-Day , Southampton docks handled military cargo to help keep the Allied forces supplied , making it a key target of Luftwaffe bombing raids until late 1944 . Southampton docks was featured in the television show 24 : Live Another Day in Day 9 : 9:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m .
Animals typically use the color green as camouflage , blending in with the chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment . Green animals include , especially , amphibians , reptiles , and some fish , birds and insects . Most fish , reptiles , amphibians , and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment . Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment . For example , broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light . Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds , especially . Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments , sometimes caused by diet . This can causes their feces to look green as well . Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins ( lychochromes ) and hemanovadin . Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields . Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one 's skin include biliverdin , the green pigment in bile , and ceruloplasmin , a protein that carries copper ions in chelation .
Galicia is further divided into 53 comarcas , 315 municipalities ( 93 in A Coruña , 67 in Lugo , 92 in Ourense , 62 in Pontevedra ) and 3,778 parishes . Municipalities are divided into parishes , which may be further divided into aldeas ( " hamlets " ) or lugares ( " places " ) . This traditional breakdown into such small areas is unusual when compared to the rest of Spain . Roughly half of the named population entities of Spain are in Galicia , which occupies only 5.8 percent of the country 's area . It is estimated that Galicia has over a million named places , over 40,000 of them being communities .
In descending order of population , Oklahoma 's largest cities in 2010 were : Oklahoma City ( 579,999 , +14.6 % ) , Tulsa ( 391,906 , −0.3 % ) , Norman ( 110,925 , +15.9 % ) , Broken Arrow ( 98,850 , +32.0 % ) , Lawton ( 96,867 , +4.4 % ) , Edmond ( 81,405 , +19.2 % ) , Moore ( 55,081 , +33.9 % ) , Midwest City ( 54,371 , +0.5 % ) , Enid ( 49,379 , +5.0 % ) , and Stillwater ( 45,688 , +17.0 % ) . Of the state 's ten largest cities , three are outside the metropolitan areas of Oklahoma City and Tulsa , and only Lawton has a metropolitan statistical area of its own as designated by the United States Census Bureau , though the metropolitan statistical area of Fort Smith , Arkansas extends into the state .
Finance proved a major problem for the Labour Party during this period ; a " cash for peerages " scandal under Blair resulted in the drying up of many major sources of donations . Declining party membership , partially due to the reduction of activists ' influence upon policy-making under the reforms of Neil Kinnock and Blair , also contributed to financial problems . Between January and March 2008 , the Labour Party received just over £3 million in donations and were £17 million in debt ; compared to the Conservatives ' £6 million in donations and £12 million in debt .
Critics noted in 2013 that Tom Wheeler , the head of the FCC , which has to approve the deal , is the former head of both the largest cable lobbying organization , the National Cable & Telecommunications Association , and as largest wireless lobby , CTIA – The Wireless Association . According to Politico , Comcast " donated to almost every member of Congress who has a hand in regulating it . " The US Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the deal on April 9 , 2014 . The House Judiciary Committee planned its own hearing . On March 6 , 2014 the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division confirmed it was investigating the deal . In March 2014 , the division 's chairman , William Baer , recused himself because he was involved in a prior Comcast NBCUniversal acquisition . Several states ' attorneys general have announced support for the federal investigation . On April 24 , 2015 , Jonathan Sallet , general counsel of the F.C.C. , said that he was going to recommend a hearing before an administrative law judge , equivalent to a collapse of the deal .
These decisions , apparently taken at the Luftflotte or Fliegerkorps level ( see Organisation of the Luftwaffe ( 1933–1945 ) ) , meant attacks on individual targets were gradually replaced by what was , for all intents and purposes , an unrestricted area attack or Terrorangriff ( Terror Attack ) . Part of the reason for this was inaccuracy of navigation . The effectiveness of British countermeasures against Knickebein , which was designed to avoid area attacks , forced the Luftwaffe to resort to these methods . The shift from precision bombing to area attack is indicated in the tactical methods and weapons dropped . KGr 100 increased its use of incendiaries from 13–28 percent . By December , this had increased to 92 percent . Use of incendiaries , which were inherently inaccurate , indicated much less care was taken to avoid civilian property close to industrial sites . Other units ceased using parachute flares and opted for explosive target markers . Captured German air crews also indicated the homes of industrial workers were deliberately targeted .
Wood to be used for construction work is commonly known as lumber in North America . Elsewhere , lumber usually refers to felled trees , and the word for sawn planks ready for use is timber . In Medieval Europe oak was the wood of choice for all wood construction , including beams , walls , doors , and floors . Today a wider variety of woods is used : solid wood doors are often made from poplar , small-knotted pine , and Douglas fir .
Howison 's personal idealism was also called " California Personalism " by others to distinguish it from the " Boston Personalism " which was of Bowne . Howison maintained that both impersonal , monistic idealism and materialism run contrary to the experience of moral freedom . To deny freedom to pursue truth , beauty , and " benignant love " is to undermine every profound human venture , including science , morality , and philosophy . Personalistic idealists Borden Parker Bowne and Edgar S. Brightman and realistic personal theist Saint Thomas Aquinas address a core issue , namely that of dependence upon an infinite personal God .
On January 21 , 2014 IBM announced that company executives would forgo bonuses for fiscal year 2013 . The move came as the firm reported a 5 % drop in sales and 1 % decline in net profit over 2012 . It also committed to a $ 1.2bn plus expansion of its data center and cloud-storage business , including the development of 15 new data centers . After ten successive quarters of flat or sliding sales under Chief Executive Virginia Rometty IBM is being forced to look at new approaches . Said Rometty , “We’ve got to reinvent ourselves like we’ve done in prior generations.”
Historically , the paper was not overtly pro-Tory or Whig , but has been a long time bastion of the English Establishment and empire . The Times adopted a stance described as " peculiarly detached " at the 1945 general election ; although it was increasingly critical of the Conservative Party 's campaign , it did not advocate a vote for any one party . However , the newspaper reverted to the Tories for the next election five years later . It supported the Conservatives for the subsequent three elections , followed by support for both the Conservatives and the Liberal Party for the next five elections , expressly supporting a Con-Lib coalition in 1974 . The paper then backed the Conservatives solidly until 1997 , when it declined to make any party endorsement but supported individual ( primarily Eurosceptic ) candidates .
While the Baptists in total ( counting both blacks and whites ) have maintained the majority in this part of the country ( known as the Bible Belt ) , the population in North Carolina practices a wide variety of faiths , including Judaism , Islam , Baha'i , Buddhism , and Hinduism . As of 2010 the Southern Baptist Church was the biggest denomination , with 4,241 churches and 1,513,000 members ; the second largest was the United Methodist Church , with 660,000 members and 1,923 churches . The third was the Roman Catholic Church , with 428,000 members in 190 congregations . The fourth greatest was the Presbyterian Church ( USA ) , with 186,000 members and 710 congregations ; this denomination was brought by Scots-Irish immigrants who settled the backcountry in the colonial era .
The island has two local newspapers , both of which are available on the Internet . The St Helena Independent has been published since November 2005 . The Sentinel newspaper was introduced in 2012 .
On December 7 , 1989 , the Communist Party of Lithuania under the leadership of Algirdas Brazauskas , split from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and abandoned its claim to have a constitutional " leading role " in politics . A smaller loyalist faction of the Communist Party , headed by hardliner Mykolas Burokevičius , was established and remained affiliated with the CPSU . However , Lithuania’s governing Communist Party was formally independent from Moscow 's control – a first for Soviet Republics and a political earthquake that prompted Gorbachev to arrange a visit to Lithuania the following month in a futile attempt to bring the local party back under control .
The noise-based speed is defined as the exposure that will lead to a given signal-to-noise ratio on individual pixels . Two ratios are used , the 40:1 ( " excellent image quality " ) and the 10:1 ( " acceptable image quality " ) ratio . These ratios have been subjectively determined based on a resolution of 70 pixels per cm ( 178 DPI ) when viewed at 25 cm ( 9.8 inch ) distance . The signal-to-noise ratio is defined as the standard deviation of a weighted average of the luminance and color of individual pixels . The noise-based speed is mostly determined by the properties of the sensor and somewhat affected by the noise in the electronic gain and AD converter .
In May 2008 Microsoft announced that 10 million Xbox 360s had been sold and that it was the " first current generation gaming console " to surpass the 10 million figure in the US . In the US , the Xbox 360 was the leader in current-generation home console sales until June 2008 , when it was surpassed by the Wii . The Xbox 360 has sold a total of 870,000 units in Canada as of August 1 , 2008 . Between January 2011 and October 2013 , the Xbox 360 was the best-selling console in the United States for these 32 consecutive months .
There are many Hokkien speakers among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia as well as in the United States . Many ethnic Han Chinese emigrants to the region were Hoklo from southern Fujian , and brought the language to what is now Burma ( Myanmar ) , Indonesia ( the former Dutch East Indies ) and present day Malaysia and Singapore ( formerly Malaya and the British Straits Settlements ) . Many of the Hokkien dialects of this region are highly similar to Taiwanese and Amoy . Hokkien is reportedly the native language of up to 98.5 % of the Chinese Filipino in the Philippines , among which is known locally as Lan-nang or Lán-lâng-oē ( " Our people’s language " ) . Hokkien speakers form the largest group of Chinese in Singapore , Malaysia and Indonesia . [ citation needed ]
Ectosymbiosis , also referred to as exosymbiosis , is any symbiotic relationship in which the symbiont lives on the body surface of the host , including the inner surface of the digestive tract or the ducts of exocrine glands . Examples of this include ectoparasites such as lice , commensal ectosymbionts such as the barnacles that attach themselves to the jaw of baleen whales , and mutualist ectosymbionts such as cleaner fish .
The English concentrated on the spirit of the events of Christ 's life , not the literality of events . They neither expected nor sought the appearance of the stigmata or any other physical manifestation . They wanted to create in themselves that environment that allowed Jesus to fulfill His divine mission , insofar as they were able . At the center of this environment was love : the love that Christ showed for humanity in becoming human . Christ 's love reveals the mercy of God and His care for His creation . English Dominican mystics sought through this love to become images of God . Love led to spiritual growth that , in turn , reflected an increase in love for God and humanity . This increase in universal love allowed men 's wills to conform to God 's will , just as Christ 's will submitted to the Father 's will .
The Czech people gained widespread national pride during the mid-eighteenth century , inspired by the Age of Enlightenment a half-century earlier . Czech historians began to emphasize their people 's accomplishments from the fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries , rebelling against the Counter-Reformation ( which had denigrated Czech and other non-Latin languages ) . Czech philologists studied sixteenth-century texts , advocating the return of the language to high culture . This period is known as the Czech National Revival ( or Renascence ) .
Nearly all the gasoline sold in the United States today is mixed with 10 percent ethanol , a mix known as E10 , and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends . Ford , DaimlerChrysler , and GM are among the automobile companies that sell flexible-fuel cars , trucks , and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85 % ethanol ( E85 ) . The challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date . The Energy Policy Act of 2005 , which calls for 7.5 billion US gallons ( 28,000,000 m3 ) of biofuels to be used annually by 2012 , will also help to expand the market .
Innate bisexuality is an idea introduced by Sigmund Freud . According to this theory , all humans are born bisexual in a very broad sense of the term , that of incorporating general aspects of both sexes . In Freud 's view , this was true anatomically and therefore also psychologically , with sexual attraction to both sexes being one part of this psychological bisexuality . Freud believed that in the course of sexual development the masculine side would normally become dominant in men and the feminine side in women , but that as adults everyone still has desires derived from both the masculine and the feminine sides of their natures . Freud did not claim that everyone is bisexual in the sense of feeling the same level of sexual attraction to both genders .
The mantle is equivalent to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water , ammonia and methane . As is customary in planetary science , this mixture is referred to as icy even though it is a hot , dense fluid . This fluid , which has a high electrical conductivity , is sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean . The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions , and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice . At a depth of 7000 km , the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones . Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may comprise an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid 'diamonds ' .
Conflict between the Germanic tribes and the forces of Rome under Julius Caesar forced major Germanic tribes to retreat to the east bank of the Rhine . Roman emperor Augustus in 12 BC ordered the conquest of the Germans , but the catastrophic Roman defeat at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest resulted in the Roman Empire abandoning its plans to completely conquer Germany . Germanic peoples in Roman territory were culturally Romanized , and although much of Germany remained free of direct Roman rule , Rome deeply influenced the development of German society , especially the adoption of Christianity by the Germans who obtained it from the Romans . In Roman-held territories with Germanic populations , the Germanic and Roman peoples intermarried , and Roman , Germanic , and Christian traditions intermingled . The adoption of Christianity would later become a major influence in the development of a common German identity .
Subsequent plans to market a Famicom console in North America featuring a keyboard , cassette data recorder , wireless joystick controller and a special BASIC cartridge under the name " Nintendo Advanced Video System " likewise never materialized . By the beginning of 1985 , the Famicom had sold more than 2.5 million units in Japan and Nintendo soon announced plans to release it in North America as the Advanced Video Entertainment System ( AVS ) that same year . The American video game press was skeptical that the console could have any success in the region , with the March 1985 issue of Electronic Games magazine stating that " the videogame market in America has virtually disappeared " and that " this could be a miscalculation on Nintendo 's part . "
Since the late 18th century , Paris has been famous for its restaurants and haute cuisine , food meticulously prepared and artfully presented . A luxury restaurant , La Taverne Anglaise , opened in 1786 in the arcades of the Palais-Royal by Antoine Beauvilliers ; it featured an elegant dining room , an extensive menu , linen tablecloths , a large wine list and well-trained waiters ; it became a model for future Paris restaurants . The restaurant Le Grand Véfour in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period . The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century , including the Café de Paris , the Rocher de Cancale , the Café Anglais , Maison Dorée and the Café Riche , were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens ; they were immortalised in the novels of Balzac and Émile Zola . Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the Belle Epoque , including Maxim 's on Rue Royale , Ledoyen in the gardens of the Champs-Élysées , and the Tour d'Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle .
Based on studies of these bronze inscriptions , it is clear that , from the Shang dynasty writing to that of the Western Zhou and early Eastern Zhou , the mainstream script evolved in a slow , unbroken fashion , until assuming the form that is now known as seal script in the late Eastern Zhou in the state of Qin , without any clear line of division . Meanwhile , other scripts had evolved , especially in the eastern and southern areas during the late Zhou dynasty , including regional forms , such as the gǔwén ( " ancient forms " ) of the eastern Warring States preserved as variant forms in the Han dynasty character dictionary Shuowen Jiezi , as well as decorative forms such as bird and insect scripts .
At the homestead , Bell set up his own workshop in the converted carriage house near to what he called his " dreaming place " , a large hollow nestled in trees at the back of the property above the river . Despite his frail condition upon arriving in Canada , Bell found the climate and environs to his liking , and rapidly improved . [ N 10 ] He continued his interest in the study of the human voice and when he discovered the Six Nations Reserve across the river at Onondaga , he learned the Mohawk language and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols . For his work , Bell was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a Mohawk headdress and danced traditional dances . [ N 11 ]
In 2007 the German professor Bassam Tibi suggested that the Rohingya conflict may be driven by an Islamist political agenda to impose religious laws , while non-religious causes have also been raised , such as a lingering resentment over the violence that occurred during the Japanese occupation of Burma in World War II—during this time period the British allied themselves with the Rohingya and fought against the puppet government of Burma ( composed mostly of Bamar Japanese ) that helped to establish the Tatmadaw military organisation that remains in power as of March 2013 .
High-voltage AC overhead systems are not only for standard gauge national networks . The meter gauge Rhaetian Railway ( RhB ) and the neighbouring Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn ( MGB ) operate on 11 kV at 16.7 Hz frequency . Practice has proven that both Swiss and German 15 kV trains can operate under these lower voltages . The RhB started trials of the 11 kV system in 1913 on the Engadin line ( St. Moritz-Scuol/Tarasp ) . The MGB constituents Furka-Oberalp-Bahn ( FO ) and Brig-Visp-Zermatt Bahn ( BVZ ) introduced their electric services in 1941 and 1929 respectively , adopting the already proven RhB system .
United States President Barack Obama and key advisers introduced a series of regulatory proposals in June 2009 . The proposals address consumer protection , executive pay , bank financial cushions or capital requirements , expanded regulation of the shadow banking system and derivatives , and enhanced authority for the Federal Reserve to safely wind-down systemically important institutions , among others . In January 2010 , Obama proposed additional regulations limiting the ability of banks to engage in proprietary trading . The proposals were dubbed " The Volcker Rule " , in recognition of Paul Volcker , who has publicly argued for the proposed changes .
Some critics of intellectual property , such as those in the free culture movement , point at intellectual monopolies as harming health ( in the case of pharmaceutical patents ) , preventing progress , and benefiting concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses , and argue that the public interest is harmed by ever-expansive monopolies in the form of copyright extensions , software patents , and business method patents . More recently scientists and engineers are expressing concern that patent thickets are undermining technological development even in high-tech fields like nanotechnology .
Although the Estonian and Germanic languages are of very different origins , one can identify many similar words in Estonian and German , for example . This is primarily because the Estonian language has borrowed nearly one third of its vocabulary from Germanic languages , mainly from Low Saxon ( Middle Low German ) during the period of German rule , and High German ( including standard German ) . The percentage of Low Saxon and High German loanwords can be estimated at 22–25 percent , with Low Saxon making up about 15 percent .
Some rock formations in the path of a glacier are sculpted into small hills called roche moutonnée , or " sheepback " rock . Roche moutonnée are elongated , rounded , and asymmetrical bedrock knobs that can be produced by glacier erosion . They range in length from less than a meter to several hundred meters long . Roche moutonnée have a gentle slope on their up-glacier sides and a steep to vertical face on their down-glacier sides . The glacier abrades the smooth slope on the upstream side as it flows along , but tears loose and carries away rock from the downstream side via plucking .
Prior to the Reformation , the Polish nobility were mostly either Roman Catholic or Orthodox with a small group of Muslims . Many families , however , soon adopted the Reformed faiths . After the Counter-Reformation , when the Roman Catholic Church regained power in Poland , the nobility became almost exclusively Catholic , despite the fact that Roman Catholicism was not the majority religion in Commonwealth ( the Catholic and Orthodox churches each accounted for some 40 % of all citizens population , with the remaining 20 % being Jews or members of Protestant denominations ) . In the 18th century , many followers of Jacob Frank joined the ranks of Jewish-descended Polish gentry . Although Jewish religion was n't usually a pretext to block or deprive of noble status , some laws favoured religious conversion from Judaism to Christianity ( see : Neophyte ) by rewarding it with ennoblement .
The Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues , established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil , largely in anticipation of the recently constructed Trans-Alaska Pipeline System . The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale , out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale ( which amounted to $ 900 million ) at once . It was later championed by Governor Jay Hammond and Kenai state representative Hugh Malone . It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since , diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund .
As of 2000 [ update ] , there were 67,115 private households in the municipality , and an average of 1.8 persons per household . There were 34,981 households that consist of only one person and 1,592 households with five or more people . In 2000 [ update ] , a total of 65,538 apartments ( 90.6 % of the total ) were permanently occupied , while 5,352 apartments ( 7.4 % ) were seasonally occupied and 1,444 apartments ( 2.0 % ) were empty . As of 2009 [ update ] , the construction rate of new housing units was 1.2 new units per 1000 residents .
New developments in Judaism often transcend differences in religious practice between Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews . In North American cities , social trends such as the chavurah movement , and the emergence of " post-denominational Judaism " often bring together younger Jews of diverse ethnic backgrounds . In recent years , there has been increased interest in Kabbalah , which many Ashkenazi Jews study outside of the Yeshiva framework . Another trend is the new popularity of ecstatic worship in the Jewish Renewal movement and the Carlebach style minyan , both of which are nominally of Ashkenazi origin .
Despite this , the Austrians , under the command of General Laudon , captured Glatz ( now Kłodzko , Poland ) in Silesia . In the Battle of Liegnitz Frederick scored a strong victory despite being outnumbered three to one . The Russians under General Saltykov and Austrians under General Lacy briefly occupied his capital , Berlin , in October , but could not hold it for long . The end of that year saw Frederick once more victorious , defeating the able Daun in the Battle of Torgau ; but he suffered very heavy casualties , and the Austrians retreated in good order .
An intellectual revitalization of Europe started with the birth of medieval universities in the 12th century . The contact with the Islamic world in Spain and Sicily , and during the Reconquista and the Crusades , allowed Europeans access to scientific Greek and Arabic texts , including the works of Aristotle , Ptolemy , Jābir ibn Hayyān , al-Khwarizmi , Alhazen , Avicenna , and Averroes . European scholars had access to the translation programs of Raymond of Toledo , who sponsored the 12th century Toledo School of Translators from Arabic to Latin . Later translators like Michael Scotus would learn Arabic in order to study these texts directly . The European universities aided materially in the translation and propagation of these texts and started a new infrastructure which was needed for scientific communities . In fact , European university put many works about the natural world and the study of nature at the center of its curriculum , with the result that the " medieval university laid far greater emphasis on science than does its modern counterpart and descendent . "
New York City is home to the headquarters of the National Football League , Major League Baseball , the National Basketball Association , the National Hockey League , and Major League Soccer . The New York metropolitan area hosts the most sports teams in these five professional leagues . Participation in professional sports in the city predates all professional leagues , and the city has been continuously hosting professional sports since the birth of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1882 . The city has played host to over forty major professional teams in the five sports and their respective competing leagues , both current and historic . Four of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built worldwide ( MetLife Stadium , the new Yankee Stadium , Madison Square Garden , and Citi Field ) are located in the New York metropolitan area . Madison Square Garden , its predecessor , as well as the original Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field , are some of the most famous sporting venues in the world , the latter two having been commemorated on U.S. postage stamps .
The bipolar junction transistor ( BJT ) was the most commonly used transistor in the 1960s and 70s . Even after MOSFETs became widely available , the BJT remained the transistor of choice for many analog circuits such as amplifiers because of their greater linearity and ease of manufacture . In integrated circuits , the desirable properties of MOSFETs allowed them to capture nearly all market share for digital circuits . Discrete MOSFETs can be applied in transistor applications , including analog circuits , voltage regulators , amplifiers , power transmitters and motor drivers .
Puerto Rico 's constitution expressly forbids capital punishment , stating " The death penalty shall not exist " , setting it apart from all U.S. states and territories other than Michigan , which also has a constitutional prohibition ( eleven other states and the District of Columbia have abolished capital punishment through statutory law ) . However , capital punishment is still applicable to offenses committed in Puerto Rico , if they fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government , though federal death penalty prosecutions there have generated significant controversy .
Gram quantities of various copper salts have been taken in suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans , possibly due to redox cycling and the generation of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA . Corresponding amounts of copper salts ( 30 mg/kg ) are toxic in animals . A minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits has been reported to be at least 3 ppm in the diet . However , higher concentrations of copper ( 100 ppm , 200 ppm , or 500 ppm ) in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed conversion efficiency , growth rates , and carcass dressing percentages .
Victoria 's father was Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn , the fourth son of the reigning King of the United Kingdom , George III . Until 1817 , Edward 's niece , Princess Charlotte of Wales , was the only legitimate grandchild of George III . Her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children . In 1818 he married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld , a widowed German princess with two children—Carl ( 1804–1856 ) and Feodora ( 1807–1872 ) —by her first marriage to the Prince of Leiningen . Her brother Leopold was Princess Charlotte 's widower . The Duke and Duchess of Kent 's only child , Victoria , was born at 4.15 a.m. on 24 May 1819 at Kensington Palace in London .
Norfolk Island Hospital is the only medical centre on the island . Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme do not cover Norfolk Island . All visitors to Norfolk Island , including Australians , are recommended to purchase travel insurance . Although the hospital can perform minor surgery , serious medical conditions are not permitted to be treated on the island and patients are flown back to mainland Australia . Air charter transport can cost in the order of A $ 30,000 . For serious emergencies , medical evacuations are provided by the Royal Australian Air Force . The island has one ambulance staffed by St John Ambulance Australia volunteers .
There are many missionary groups operating in the country , including Lutherans , Baptists , Catholics , Grace Brethren , and Jehovah 's Witnesses . While these missionaries are predominantly from the United States , France , Italy , and Spain , many are also from Nigeria , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and other African countries . Large numbers of missionaries left the country when fighting broke out between rebel and government forces in 2002–3 , but many of them have now returned to continue their work .
According to Johnson and Grim ( 2013 ) , Buddhism has grown from a total of 138 million adherents in 1910 , of which 137 million were in Asia , to 495 million in 2010 , of which 487 million are in Asia . According to them , there was a fast annual growth of Buddhism in Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Lebanon and several Western European countries ( 1910–2010 ) . More recently ( 2000–2010 ) , the countries with highest growth rates are Qatar , the United Arab Emirates , Iran and some African countries .
The term Cubism did not come into general usage until 1911 , mainly with reference to Metzinger , Gleizes , Delaunay , and Léger . In 1911 , the poet and critic Guillaume Apollinaire accepted the term on behalf of a group of artists invited to exhibit at the Brussels Indépendants . The following year , in preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or , Metzinger and Gleizes wrote and published Du " Cubisme " in an effort to dispel the confusion raging around the word , and as a major defence of Cubism ( which had caused a public scandal following the 1911 Salon des Indépendants and the 1912 Salon d'Automne in Paris ) . Clarifying their aims as artists , this work was the first theoretical treatise on Cubism and it still remains the clearest and most intelligible . The result , not solely a collaboration between its two authors , reflected discussions by the circle of artists who met in Puteaux and Courbevoie . It mirrored the attitudes of the " artists of Passy " , which included Picabia and the Duchamp brothers , to whom sections of it were read prior to publication . The concept developed in Du " Cubisme " of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously , i.e. , the act of moving around an object to seize it from several successive angles fused into a single image ( multiple viewpoints , mobile perspective , simultaneity or multiplicity ) , is a generally recognized device used by the Cubists .
Endemic species can be threatened with extinction through the process of genetic pollution , i.e . uncontrolled hybridization , introgression and genetic swamping . Genetic pollution leads to homogenization or replacement of local genomes as a result of either a numerical and/or fitness advantage of an introduced species . Hybridization and introgression are side-effects of introduction and invasion . These phenomena can be especially detrimental to rare species that come into contact with more abundant ones . The abundant species can interbreed with the rare species , swamping its gene pool . This problem is not always apparent from morphological ( outward appearance ) observations alone . Some degree of gene flow is normal adaptation , and not all gene and genotype constellations can be preserved . However , hybridization with or without introgression may , nevertheless , threaten a rare species ' existence .
The function of Apollo as a " healer " is connected with Paean ( Παιών-Παιήων ) , the physician of the Gods in the Iliad , who seems to come from a more primitive religion . Paeοn is probably connected with the Mycenean pa-ja-wo-ne ( Linear B : 𐀞𐀊𐀍𐀚 ) , but this is not certain . He did not have a separate cult , but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease . Later the Greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song " paean " ( παιάν ) . The magicians were also called " seer-doctors " ( ἰατρομάντεις ) , and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god Apollo at the oracles .
Radio St Helena , which started operations on Christmas Day 1967 , provided a local radio service that had a range of about 100 km ( 62 mi ) from the island , and also broadcast internationally on shortwave radio ( 11092.5 kHz ) on one day a year . The station presented news , features and music in collaboration with its sister newspaper , the St Helena Herald . It closed on 25 December 2012 to make way for a new three-channel FM service , also funded by St. Helena Government and run by the South Atlantic Media Services ( formerly St. Helena Broadcasting ( Guarantee ) Corporation ) .
One of the oldest cities in the United States , Boston was founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from England . It was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution , such as the Boston Massacre , the Boston Tea Party , the Battle of Bunker Hill , and the Siege of Boston . Upon American independence from Great Britain , the city continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub , as well as a center for education and culture . Through land reclamation and municipal annexation , Boston has expanded beyond the original peninsula . Its rich history attracts many tourists , with Faneuil Hall alone drawing over 20 million visitors per year . Boston 's many firsts include the United States ' first public school , Boston Latin School ( 1635 ) , and first subway system ( 1897 ) .
In 1846 , the United States went to war against Mexico and sent a naval and land expedition to conquer Alta California . At first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports including San Diego , but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back . Following the successful revolt in Los Angeles , the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846 . Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24 , 1846 , when the Americans recaptured it . For the next several months the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo . Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night . The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out . On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General Stephen W. Kearney were at Warner 's Ranch . Commodore Robert F. Stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain Archibald Gillespie to march north to meet him . Their joint command of 150 men , returning to San Diego , encountered about 93 Californios under Andrés Pico . In the ensuing Battle of San Pasqual , fought in the San Pasqual Valley which is now part of the city of San Diego , the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign . Subsequently a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego , rescuing Kearny 's battered and blockaded command .
Many different disciplines have produced work on the emotions . Human sciences study the role of emotions in mental processes , disorders , and neural mechanisms . In psychiatry , emotions are examined as part of the discipline 's study and treatment of mental disorders in humans . Nursing studies emotions as part of its approach to the provision of holistic health care to humans . Psychology examines emotions from a scientific perspective by treating them as mental processes and behavior and they explore the underlying physiological and neurological processes . In neuroscience sub-fields such as social neuroscience and affective neuroscience , scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotion by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality , emotion , and mood . In linguistics , the expression of emotion may change to the meaning of sounds . In education , the role of emotions in relation to learning is examined .
BYU 's stated mission " is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life . " BYU is thus considered by its leaders to be at heart a religious institution , wherein , ideally , religious and secular education are interwoven in a way that encourages the highest standards in both areas . This weaving of the secular and the religious aspects of a religious university goes back as far as Brigham Young himself , who told Karl G. Maeser when the Church purchased the school : " I want you to remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God . "
Despite these criticisms , Comcast has appeared on multiple " top places to work " lists . In 2009 , it was included on CableFAX magazine 's " Top 10 Places to Work in Cable " , which cited its " scale , savvy and vision " . Similarly , the Philadelphia Business Journal awarded Comcast the silver medal among extra-large companies in Philadelphia , with the gold medal going to partner organization , Comcast-Spectacor . The Boston Globe found Comcast to be that city 's top place to work in 2009 . Employee diversity is also an attribute upon which Comcast receives strong marks . In 2008 , Black Enterprise magazine rated Comcast among the top 15 companies for workforce diversity . Comcast was also named a " Top 2014 Workplace " by the Washington Post in their annual feature .
Broadly speaking , Daylight Saving Time was abandoned in the years after the war ( with some notable exceptions including Canada , the UK , France , and Ireland for example ) . However , it was brought back for periods of time in many different places during the following decades , and commonly during the Second World War . It became widely adopted , particularly in North America and Europe starting in the 1970s as a result of the 1970s energy crisis .
The government broadened land ownership by returning land that had been sold to large landowners in the late Ming period by families unable to pay the land tax . To give people more incentives to participate in the market , they reduced the tax burden in comparison with the late Ming , and replaced the corvée system with a head tax used to hire laborers . The administration of the Grand Canal was made more efficient , and transport opened to private merchants . A system of monitoring grain prices eliminated severe shortages , and enabled the price of rice to rise slowly and smoothly through the 18th century . Wary of the power of wealthy merchants , Qing rulers limited their trading licenses and usually refused them permission to open new mines , except in poor areas . These restrictions on domestic resource exploration , as well as on foreign trade , are held by some scholars as a cause of the Great Divergence , by which the Western world overtook China economically .
It is thought that annelids were originally animals with two separate sexes , which released ova and sperm into the water via their nephridia . The fertilized eggs develop into trochophore larvae , which live as plankton . Later they sink to the sea-floor and metamorphose into miniature adults : the part of the trochophore between the apical tuft and the prototroch becomes the prostomium ( head ) ; a small area round the trochophore 's anus becomes the pygidium ( tail-piece ) ; a narrow band immediately in front of that becomes the growth zone that produces new segments ; and the rest of the trochophore becomes the peristomium ( the segment that contains the mouth ) .
With the rise of disco in the US and punk rock in the UK , hard rock 's mainstream dominance was rivalled toward the later part of the decade . Disco appealed to a more diverse group of people and punk seemed to take over the rebellious role that hard rock once held . Early punk bands like The Ramones explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock , with almost all of their songs clocking in around two minutes with no guitar solos . However , new rock acts continued to emerge and record sales remained high into the 1980s . 1977 saw the début and rise to stardom of Foreigner , who went on to release several platinum albums through to the mid-1980s . Midwestern groups like Kansas , REO Speedwagon and Styx helped further cement heavy rock in the Midwest as a form of stadium rock . In 1978 , Van Halen emerged from the Los Angeles music scene with a sound based around the skills of lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen . He popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping , showcased on the song " Eruption " from the album Van Halen , which was highly influential in re-establishing hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion , while also redefining and elevating the role of electric guitar .
During the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony and only six weeks before the wedding of Charles , Prince of Wales , and Lady Diana Spencer , six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down The Mall on her horse , Burmese . Police later discovered that the shots were blanks . The 17-year-old assailant , Marcus Sarjeant , was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three . The Queen 's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised . From April to September 1982 , the Queen remained anxious but proud of her son , Prince Andrew , who was serving with British forces during the Falklands War . On 9 July , the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder , Michael Fagan , in the room with her . Remaining calm and through two calls to the Palace police switchboard , she spoke to Fagan while he sat at the foot of her bed until assistance arrived seven minutes later . Though she hosted US President Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visited his Californian ranch in 1983 , she was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada , one of her Caribbean realms , without informing her .
By 1790 , the Jewish population of Alsace was approximately 22,500 , about 3 % of the provincial population . They were highly segregated and subject to long-standing anti-Jewish regulations . They maintained their own customs , Yiddish language , and historic traditions within the tightly-knit ghettos ; they adhered to Talmudic law enforced by their rabbis . Jews were barred from most cities and instead lived in villages . They concentrated in trade , services , and especially in money lending . They financed about a third of the mortgages in Alsace . Official tolerance grew during the French Revolution , with full emancipation in 1791 . However , local antisemitism also increased and Napoleon turned hostile in 1806 , imposing a one-year moratorium on all debts owed to Jews . [ citation needed ] In the 1830-1870 era most Jews moved to the cities , where they integrated and acculturated , as antisemitism sharply declined . By 1831 , the state began paying salaries to official rabbis , and in 1846 a special legal oath for Jews was discontinued . Antisemitic local riots occasionally occurred , especially during the Revolution of 1848 . Merger of Alsace into Germany in 1871-1918 lessened antisemitic violence .
As for Mac OS , System 7 was a 32-bit rewrite from Pascal to C++ that introduced virtual memory and improved the handling of color graphics , as well as memory addressing , networking , and co-operative multitasking . Also during this time , the Macintosh began to shed the " Snow White " design language , along with the expensive consulting fees they were paying to Frogdesign . Apple instead brought the design work in-house by establishing the Apple Industrial Design Group , becoming responsible for crafting a new look for all Apple products .
About the creation-evolution controversy , Popper wrote that he considered it " a somewhat sensational clash between a brilliant scientific hypothesis concerning the history of the various species of animals and plants on earth , and an older metaphysical theory which , incidentally , happened to be part of an established religious belief " with a footnote to the effect that " [ he ] agree [ s ] with Professor C.E . Raven when , in his Science , Religion , and the Future , 1943 , he calls this conflict " a storm in a Victorian tea-cup " ; though the force of this remark is perhaps a little impaired by the attention he pays to the vapours still emerging from the cup—to the Great Systems of Evolutionist Philosophy , produced by Bergson , Whitehead , Smuts , and others . "
All iPods except for the iPod Touch can function in " disk mode " as mass storage devices to store data files but this may not be the default behavior , and in the case of the iPod Touch , requires special software . [ citation needed ] If an iPod is formatted on a Mac OS computer , it uses the HFS+ file system format , which allows it to serve as a boot disk for a Mac computer . If it is formatted on Windows , the FAT32 format is used . With the release of the Windows-compatible iPod , the default file system used on the iPod line switched from HFS+ to FAT32 , although it can be reformatted to either file system ( excluding the iPod Shuffle which is strictly FAT32 ) . Generally , if a new iPod ( excluding the iPod Shuffle ) is initially plugged into a computer running Windows , it will be formatted with FAT32 , and if initially plugged into a Mac running Mac OS it will be formatted with HFS+ .
During the Middle Ages , shipbuilding became an important industry for the town . Henry V 's famous warship HMS Grace Dieu was built in Southampton . Walter Taylor 's 18th century mechanisation of the block-making process was a significant step in the Industrial Revolution . From 1904 to 2004 , the Thornycroft shipbuilding yard was a major employer in Southampton , building and repairing ships used in the two World Wars .
In addition to membership , as of 2010 [ update ] there are 1,335 officially registered fan clubs , called penyes , around the world . The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona . Among the best supported teams globally , Barcelona has the highest social media following in the world among sports teams , with over 90 million Facebook fans as of February 2016 . The club has had many prominent people among its supporters , including Pope John Paul II , who was an honorary member , and former prime minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero . FC Barcelona has the second highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund .
All signatories to the CPPCG are required to prevent and punish acts of genocide , both in peace and wartime , though some barriers make this enforcement difficult . In particular , some of the signatories—namely , Bahrain , Bangladesh , India , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , the United States , Vietnam , Yemen , and former Yugoslavia—signed with the proviso that no claim of genocide could be brought against them at the International Court of Justice without their consent . Despite official protests from other signatories ( notably Cyprus and Norway ) on the ethics and legal standing of these reservations , the immunity from prosecution they grant has been invoked from time to time , as when the United States refused to allow a charge of genocide brought against it by former Yugoslavia following the 1999 Kosovo War .
Athanasius also wrote a two-part Against the Heathen and The Incarnation of the Word of God . Completed probably early in his life , before the Arian controversy , they constitute the first classic work of developed Orthodox theology . In the first part , Athanasius attacks several pagan practices and beliefs . The second part presents teachings on the redemption . Also in these books , Athanasius put forward the belief that the Son of God , the eternal Word through whom God created the world , entered that world in human form to lead men back into the harmony from which they had earlier fallen away .
Ruben Studdard emerged as the winner , beating Clay Aiken by a small margin . Out of a total of 24 million votes , Studdard finished just 134,000 votes ahead of Aiken . This slim margin of victory was controversial due to the large number of calls that failed to get through . In an interview prior to season five , executive producer Nigel Lythgoe indicated that Aiken had led the fan voting from the wildcard week onward until the finale .
Polytechnic schools are distinct from academic universities in Finland . Ammattikorkeakoulu is the common term in Finland , as is the Swedish alternative " yrkeshögskola " – their focus is on studies leading to a degree ( for instance insinööri , engineer ; in international use , Bachelor of Engineering ) in kind different from but in level comparable to an academic bachelor 's degree awarded by a university . Since 2006 the polytechnics have offered studies leading to master 's degrees ( Master of Engineering ) . After January 1 , 2006 , some Finnish ammattikorkeakoulus switched the English term " polytechnic " to the term " university of applied sciences " in the English translations of their legal names . The ammattikorkeakoulu has many similarities to the hogeschool in Belgium and in the Netherlands and to the Fachhochschule in the German language areas .
Although dissertations on clothing and its function appear from the 19th century as colonising countries dealt with new environments , concerted scientific research into psycho-social , physiological and other functions of clothing ( e.g . protective , cartage ) occurred in the first half of the 20th century , with publications such as J. C. Flügel 's Psychology of Clothes in 1930 , and Newburgh 's seminal Physiology of Heat Regulation and The Science of Clothing in 1949 . By 1968 , the field of environmental physiology had advanced and expanded significantly , but the science of clothing in relation to environmental physiology had changed little . While considerable research has since occurred and the knowledge-base has grown significantly , the main concepts remain unchanged , and indeed Newburgh 's book is still cited by contemporary authors , including those attempting to develop thermoregulatory models of clothing development .
Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools : the original undergraduate college , the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences , and twelve professional schools . While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation , each school 's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs . In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven , the University owns athletic facilities in western New Haven , including the Yale Bowl , a campus in West Haven , Connecticut , and forest and nature preserves throughout New England . The university 's assets include an endowment valued at $ 25.6 billion as of September 2015 , the second largest of any educational institution.The Yale University Library , serving all constituent schools , holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States .
Gaddafi sought to develop closer links in the Maghreb ; in January 1974 Libya and Tunisia announced a political union , the Arab Islamic Republic . Although advocated by Gaddafi and Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba , the move was deeply unpopular in Tunisia and soon abandoned . Retaliating , Gaddafi sponsored anti-government militants in Tunisia into the 1980s . Turning his attention to Algeria , in 1975 Libya signed the Hassi Messaoud defence agreement allegedly to counter " Moroccan expansionism " , also funding the Polisario Front of Western Sahara in their independence struggle against Morocco . Seeking to diversify Libya 's economy , Gaddafi 's government began purchasing shares in major European corporations like Fiat as well as buying real estate in Malta and Italy , which would become a valuable source of income during the 1980s oil slump .
According to a report published in 2014 , about 43 % of all Jews reside in Israel ( 6.1 million ) , and 40 % in the United States ( 5.7 million ) , with most of the remainder living in Europe ( 1.4 million ) and Canada ( 0.4 million ) . These numbers include all those who self-identified as Jews in a socio-demographic study or were identified as such by a respondent in the same household . The exact world Jewish population , however , is difficult to measure . In addition to issues with census methodology , disputes among proponents of halakhic , secular , political , and ancestral identification factors regarding who is a Jew may affect the figure considerably depending on the source .
Tsai writes that shortly after the visit by Deshin Shekpa , the Yongle Emperor ordered the construction of a road and of trading posts in the upper reaches of the Yangzi and Mekong Rivers in order to facilitate trade with Tibet in tea , horses , and salt . The trade route passed through Sichuan and crossed Shangri-La County in Yunnan . Wang and Nyima assert that this " tribute-related trade " of the Ming exchanging Chinese tea for Tibetan horses—while granting Tibetan envoys and Tibetan merchants explicit permission to trade with Han Chinese merchants— " furthered the rule of the Ming dynasty court over Tibet " . Rossabi and Sperling note that this trade in Tibetan horses for Chinese tea existed long before the Ming . Peter C. Perdue says that Wang Anshi ( 1021–1086 ) , realizing that China could not produce enough militarily capable steeds , had also aimed to obtain horses from Inner Asia in exchange for Chinese tea . The Chinese needed horses not only for cavalry but also as draft animals for the army 's supply wagons . The Tibetans required Chinese tea not only as a common beverage but also as a religious ceremonial supplement . The Ming government imposed a monopoly on tea production and attempted to regulate this trade with state-supervised markets , but these collapsed in 1449 due to military failures and internal ecological and commercial pressures on the tea-producing regions .
Near New Haven there is the static inverter plant of the HVDC Cross Sound Cable . There are three PureCell Model 400 fuel cells placed in the city of New Haven—one at the New Haven Public Schools and newly constructed Roberto Clemente School , one at the mixed-use 360 State Street building , and one at City Hall . According to Giovanni Zinn of the city 's Office of Sustainability , each fuel cell may save the city up to $ 1 million in energy costs over a decade . The fuel cells were provided by ClearEdge Power , formerly UTC Power .
The translator 's role as a bridge for " carrying across " values between cultures has been discussed at least since Terence , the 2nd-century-BCE Roman adapter of Greek comedies . The translator 's role is , however , by no means a passive , mechanical one , and so has also been compared to that of an artist . The main ground seems to be the concept of parallel creation found in critics such as Cicero . Dryden observed that " Translation is a type of drawing after life ... " Comparison of the translator with a musician or actor goes back at least to Samuel Johnson’s remark about Alexander Pope playing Homer on a flageolet , while Homer himself used a bassoon .
Colonial Lowcountry landowners experimented with cash crops ranging from tea to silkworms . African slaves brought knowledge of rice cultivation , which plantation owners cultivated and developed as a successful commodity crop by 1700 . With the coerced help of African slaves from the Caribbean , Eliza Lucas , daughter of plantation owner George Lucas , learned how to raise and use indigo in the Lowcountry in 1747 . Supported with subsidies from Britain , indigo was a leading export by 1750 . Those and naval stores were exported in an extremely profitable shipping industry .
Qutb Shahi architecture of the 16th and early 17th centuries followed classical Persian architecture featuring domes and colossal arches . The oldest surviving Qutb Shahi structure in Hyderabad is the ruins of Golconda fort built in the 16th century . The Charminar , Mecca Masjid , Charkaman and Qutb Shahi tombs are other existing structures of this period . Among these the Charminar has become an icon of the city ; located in the centre of old Hyderabad , it is a square structure with sides 20 m ( 66 ft ) long and four grand arches each facing a road . At each corner stands a 56 m ( 184 ft ) -high minaret . Most of the historical bazaars that still exist were constructed on the street north of Charminar towards Golconda fort . The Charminar , Qutb Shahi tombs and Golconda fort are considered to be monuments of national importance in India ; in 2010 the Indian government proposed that the sites be listed for UNESCO World Heritage status . :11–18
In 2004 , NIST researchers presented evidence that an isotropic non-crystalline metallic phase ( dubbed " q-glass " ) could be grown from the melt . This phase is the first phase , or " primary phase , " to form in the Al-Fe-Si system during rapid cooling . Interestingly , experimental evidence indicates that this phase forms by a first-order transition . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) images show that the q-glass nucleates from the melt as discrete particles , which grow spherically with a uniform growth rate in all directions . The diffraction pattern shows it to be an isotropic glassy phase . Yet there is a nucleation barrier , which implies an interfacial discontinuity ( or internal surface ) between the glass and the melt .
Incubation , which optimises temperature for chick development , usually begins after the last egg has been laid . In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared , whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation . Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches , areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds . Incubation can be an energetically demanding process ; adult albatrosses , for instance , lose as much as 83 grams ( 2.9 oz ) of body weight per day of incubation . The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun , decaying vegetation or volcanic sources . Incubation periods range from 10 days ( in woodpeckers , cuckoos and passerine birds ) to over 80 days ( in albatrosses and kiwis ) .
However , there is significant disagreement within Orthodox Judaism , particularly between Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism , about the extent and circumstances under which the proper application of Halakha should be re-examined as a result of changing realities . As a general rule , Haredi Jews believe that when at all possible the law should be maintained as it was understood by their authorities at the haskalah , believing that it had never changed . Modern Orthodox authorities are more willing to assume that under scrupulous examination , identical principles may lead to different applications in the context of modern life . To the Orthodox Jew , halakha is a guide , God 's Law , governing the structure of daily life from the moment he or she wakes up to the moment he goes to sleep . It includes codes of behaviour applicable to a broad range of circumstances ( and many hypothetical ones ) . There are though a number of halakhic meta-principles that guide the halakhic process and in an instance of opposition between a specific halakha and a meta-principle , the meta-principle often wins out . Examples of Halakhic Meta-Principles are : " Deracheha Darchei Noam " - the ways of Torah are pleasant , " Kavod Habriyot " - basic respect for human beings , " Pikuach Nefesh " - the sanctity of human life .
A brash boosterism that had typified Melbourne during this time ended in the early 1890s with a severe depression of the city 's economy , sending the local finance and property industries into a period of chaos during which 16 small " land banks " and building societies collapsed , and 133 limited companies went into liquidation . The Melbourne financial crisis was a contributing factor in the Australian economic depression of the 1890s and the Australian banking crisis of 1893 . The effects of the depression on the city were profound , with virtually no new construction until the late 1890s .
Comcast delivers third-party television programming content to its own customers , and also produces its own first-party content both for subscribers and customers of other competing television services . Fully or partially owned Comcast programming includes Comcast Newsmakers , Comcast Network , Comcast SportsNet , SportsNet New York , MLB Network , Comcast Sports Southeast/Charter Sports Southeast , NBC Sports Network , The Golf Channel , AZN Television , and FEARnet . On May 19 , 2009 , Disney and ESPN announced an agreement to allow Comcast Corporation to carry the channels ESPNU and ESPN3 . The U.S. Olympic Committee and Comcast intended to team up to create The U.S. Olympic Network , which was slated to launch after the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games . These plans were then put on hold by the U.S. Olympic Committee . The U.S. Olympic Committee and Comcast have ended the plans to create The U.S. Olympic Network .
Somalia established its first ISP in 1999 , one of the last countries in Africa to get connected to the Internet . According to the telecommunications resource Balancing Act , growth in internet connectivity has since then grown considerably , with around 53 % of the entire nation covered as of 2009 . Both internet commerce and telephony have consequently become among the quickest growing local businesses .
When it comes to civil and criminal cases , the Bundesgerichtshof is at the top of the hierarchy of courts . The other branches of the German judicial system each have their own appellate systems , each topped by a high court ; these are the Bundessozialgericht for matters of social security , the Bundesarbeitsgericht for employment and labour , the Bundesfinanzhof for taxation and financial issues , and the Bundesverwaltungsgericht for administrative law . The so-called Gemeinsamer Senat der Obersten Gerichtshöfe ( Joint Senate of the Supreme Courts ) is not a supreme court in itself , but an ad-hoc body that is convened in only when one supreme court intends to diverge from another supreme court 's legal opinion or when a certain case exceeds the authority of one court . As the courts have well-defined areas of responsibility , situations like these are rather rare and so , the Joint Senate gathers very infrequently , and only to consider matters which are mostly definitory .
Genetic studies of mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) of Amerindians and some Siberian and Central Asian peoples also revealed that the gene pool of the Turkic-speaking peoples of Siberia such as Altaians , Khakas , Shors and Soyots , living between the Altai and Lake Baikal along the Sayan mountains , are genetically closest to Amerindians . [ citation needed ] This view is shared by other researchers who argue that " the ancestors of the American Indians were the first to separate from the great Asian population in the Middle Paleolithic . 2012 research found evidence for a recent common ancestry between Native Americans and indigenous Altaians based on mitochondrial DNA and Y-Chromosome analysis . The paternal lineages of Altaians mostly belong to the subclades of haplogroup P-M45 ( xR1a 38-93 % ; xQ1a 4-32 % ) .
In the 1960s , American and British blues and rock bands began to modify rock and roll by adding harder sounds , heavier guitar riffs , bombastic drumming , and louder vocals , from electric blues . Early forms of hard rock can be heard in the work of Chicago blues musicians Elmore James , Muddy Waters , and Howlin ' Wolf , The Kingsmen 's version of " Louie Louie " ( 1963 ) which made it a garage rock standard , and the songs of rhythm and blues influenced British Invasion acts , including " You Really Got Me " by The Kinks ( 1964 ) , " My Generation " by The Who ( 1965 ) , " Shapes of Things " ( 1966 ) by The Yardbirds and " ( I Ca n't Get No ) Satisfaction " ( 1965 ) by The Rolling Stones . From the late 1960s , it became common to divide mainstream rock music that emerged from psychedelia into soft and hard rock . Soft rock was often derived from folk rock , using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies . In contrast , hard rock was most often derived from blues rock and was played louder and with more intensity .
On August 31 , 1886 , Charleston was nearly destroyed by an earthquake . The shock was estimated to have a moment magnitude of 7.0 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X ( Extreme ) . It was felt as far away as Boston to the north , Chicago and Milwaukee to the northwest , as far west as New Orleans , as far south as Cuba , and as far east as Bermuda . It damaged 2,000 buildings in Charleston and caused $ 6 million worth of damage ( $ 133 million in 2006 dollars ) , at a time when all the city 's buildings were valued around $ 24 million ( $ 531 million in 2006 dollars ) .
Elimination of Polish elites and intelligentia was part of Generalplan Ost . The Intelligenzaktion , a plan to eliminate the Polish intelligentsia , Poland 's 'leadership class ' , took place soon after the German invasion of Poland , lasting from fall of 1939 till spring of 1940 . As the result of this operation in 10 regional actions about 60,000 Polish nobles , teachers , social workers , priests , judges and political activists were killed . It was continued in May 1940 when Germany launched AB-Aktion , More than 16,000 members of the intelligentsia were murdered in Operation Tannenberg alone .
Although spoken Tibetan varies according to the region , the written language , based on Classical Tibetan , is consistent throughout . This is probably due to the long-standing influence of the Tibetan empire , whose rule embraced ( and extended at times far beyond ) the present Tibetan linguistic area , which runs from northern Pakistan in the west to Yunnan and Sichuan in the east , and from north of Qinghai Lake south as far as Bhutan . The Tibetan language has its own script which it shares with Ladakhi and Dzongkha , and which is derived from the ancient Indian Brāhmī script .
At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2015 , Beyoncé was nominated for six awards , ultimately winning three : Best R & B Performance and Best R & B Song for " Drunk in Love " , and Best Surround Sound Album for Beyoncé . She was nominated for Album of the Year but the award was won by Beck for his Morning Phase album . In August , the cover of the September issue of Vogue magazine was unveiled online , Beyoncé as the cover star , becoming the first African-American artist and third African-American woman in general to cover the September issue . She headlined the 2015 Made in America festival in early September and also the Global Citizen Festival later that month . Beyoncé made an uncredited featured appearance on the track " Hymn for the Weekend " by British rock band Coldplay , on their seventh studio album A Head Full of Dreams ( 2015 ) , which saw release in December . On January 7 , 2016 , Pepsi announced Beyoncé would perform alongside Coldplay at Super Bowl 50 in February . Knowles has previously performed at four Super Bowl shows throughout her career , serving as the main headliner of the 47th Super Bowl halftime show in 2013 .
Popular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of Mary 's conception . In 1439 , the Council of Basel , which is not reckoned an ecumenical council , stated that belief in the immaculate conception of Mary is in accord with the Catholic faith . By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties , but such was the influence of the Dominicans , and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas ( who had been canonised in 1323 and declared " Doctor Angelicus " of the Church in 1567 ) that the Council of Trent ( 1545–63 ) —which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine—instead declined to take a position .
To improve the efficiency of the lamp , the filament usually consists of multiple coils of coiled fine wire , also known as a 'coiled coil ' . For a 60-watt 120-volt lamp , the uncoiled length of the tungsten filament is usually 22.8 inches ( 580 mm ) , and the filament diameter is 0.0018 inches ( 0.046 mm ) . The advantage of the coiled coil is that evaporation of the tungsten filament is at the rate of a tungsten cylinder having a diameter equal to that of the coiled coil . The coiled-coil filament evaporates more slowly than a straight filament of the same surface area and light-emitting power . As a result , the filament can then run hotter , which results in a more efficient light source , while reducing the evaporation so that the filament will last longer than a straight filament at the same temperature .
Palmerston died in 1865 , and after a brief ministry led by Russell , Derby returned to power . In 1866 , Victoria attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time since Albert 's death . The following year she supported the passing of the Reform Act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men , though she was not in favour of votes for women . Derby resigned in 1868 , to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli , who charmed Victoria . " Everyone likes flattery , " he said , " and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel . " With the phrase " we authors , Ma'am " , he complimented her . Disraeli 's ministry only lasted a matter of months , and at the end of the year his Liberal rival , William Ewart Gladstone , was appointed prime minister . Victoria found Gladstone 's demeanour far less appealing ; he spoke to her , she is thought to have complained , as though she were " a public meeting rather than a woman " .
Of the approximately 850 municipalities of Thuringia , 126 are classed as towns ( within a district ) or cities ( forming their own urban district ) . Most of the towns are small with a population of less than 10,000 ; only the ten biggest ones have a population greater than 30,000 . The first towns emerged during the 12th century , whereas the latest ones received town status only in the 20th century . Today , all municipalities within districts are equal in law , whether they are towns or villages . Independent cities ( i.e . urban districts ) have greater powers ( the same as any district ) than towns within a district .
There are several theories to the Islamisation process in Southeast Asia . Another theory is trade . The expansion of trade among West Asia , India and Southeast Asia helped the spread of the religion as Muslim traders from Southern Yemen ( Hadramout ) brought Islam to the region with their large volume of trade . Many settled in Indonesia , Singapore , and Malaysia . This is evident in the Arab-Indonesian , Arab-Singaporean , and Arab-Malay populations who were at one time very prominent in each of their countries . The second theory is the role of missionaries or Sufis . [ citation needed ] The Sufi missionaries played a significant role in spreading the faith by introducing Islamic ideas to the region . Finally , the ruling classes embraced Islam and that further aided the permeation of the religion throughout the region . The ruler of the region 's most important port , Malacca Sultanate , embraced Islam in the 15th century , heralding a period of accelerated conversion of Islam throughout the region as Islam provided a positive force among the ruling and trading classes .
Trade secret misappropriation is different from violations of other intellectual property laws , since by definition trade secrets are secret , while patents and registered copyrights and trademarks are publicly available . In the United States , trade secrets are protected under state law , and states have nearly universally adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act . The United States also has federal law in the form of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 ( 18 U.S.C . §§ 1831–1839 ) , which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime . This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity . The first , 18 U.S.C . § 1831 ( a ) , criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers . The second , 18 U.S.C . § 1832 , criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes . ( The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses . ) In Commonwealth common law jurisdictions , confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an equitable right rather than a property right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as the United States .

Yale traces its beginnings to " An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School , " passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut on October 9 , 1701 , while meeting in New Haven . The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut . Soon thereafter , a group of ten Congregationalist ministers : Samuel Andrew , Thomas Buckingham , Israel Chauncy , Samuel Mather , Rev . James Noyes II ( son of James Noyes ) , James Pierpont , Abraham Pierson , Noadiah Russell , Joseph Webb and Timothy Woodbridge , all alumni of Harvard , met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell in Branford , Connecticut , to pool their books to form the school 's library . The group , led by James Pierpont , is now known as " The Founders " . [ citation needed ]
Yale expanded gradually , establishing the Yale School of Medicine ( 1810 ) , Yale Divinity School ( 1822 ) , Yale Law School ( 1843 ) , Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences ( 1847 ) , the Sheffield Scientific School ( 1847 ) , and the Yale School of Fine Arts ( 1869 ) . In 1887 , as the college continued to grow under the presidency of Timothy Dwight V , Yale College was renamed Yale University . The university would later add the Yale School of Music ( 1894 ) , the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies ( founded by Gifford Pinchot in 1900 ) , the Yale School of Public Health ( 1915 ) , the Yale School of Nursing ( 1923 ) , the Yale School of Drama ( 1955 ) , the Yale Physician Associate Program ( 1973 ) , and the Yale School of Management ( 1976 ) . It would also reorganize its relationship with the Sheffield Scientific School .
Genre fiction also showed it could question reality in its 20th century forms , in spite of its fixed formulas , through the enquiries of the skeptical detective and the alternative realities of science fiction . The separation of " mainstream " and " genre " forms ( including journalism ) continued to blur during the period up to our own times . William Burroughs , in his early works , and Hunter S. Thompson expanded documentary reporting into strong subjective statements after the second World War , and post-modern critics have disparaged the idea of objective realism in general .
Sacerdotalis caelibatus ( Latin for " Of the celibate priesthood " ) , promulgated on 24 June 1967 , defends the Catholic Church 's tradition of priestly celibacy in the West . This encyclical was written in the wake of Vatican II , when the Catholic Church was questioning and revising many long-held practices . Priestly celibacy is considered a discipline rather than dogma , and some had expected that it might be relaxed . In response to these questions , the Pope reaffirms the discipline as a long-held practice with special importance in the Catholic Church . The encyclical Sacerdotalis caelibatus from 24 June 1967 , confirms the traditional Church teaching , that celibacy is an ideal state and continues to be mandatory for Roman Catholic priests . Celibacy symbolizes the reality of the kingdom of God amid modern society . The priestly celibacy is closely linked to the sacramental priesthood . However , during his pontificate Paul VI was considered generous in permitting bishops to grant laicization of priests who wanted to leave the sacerdotal state , a position which was drastically reversed by John Paul II in 1980 and cemented in the 1983 Canon Law that only the pope can in exceptional circumstances grant laicization .
The bel ( B ) and the smaller decibel ( dB ) are units of measurement of sound intensity invented by Bell Labs and named after him . [ N 28 ] Since 1976 the IEEE 's Alexander Graham Bell Medal has been awarded to honor outstanding contributions in the field of telecommunications .
Spielberg 's next film , Schindler 's List , was based on the true story of Oskar Schindler , a man who risked his life to save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust . Schindler 's List earned Spielberg his first Academy Award for Best Director ( it also won Best Picture ) . With the film a huge success at the box office , Spielberg used the profits to set up the Shoah Foundation , a non-profit organization that archives filmed testimony of Holocaust survivors . In 1997 , the American Film Institute listed it among the 10 Greatest American Films ever Made ( # 9 ) which moved up to ( # 8 ) when the list was remade in 2007 .
The state has one city with a population exceeding one million : Ciudad Juárez . Ciudad Juárez is ranked eighth most populous city in the country and Chihuahua City was ranked 16th most populous in Mexico . Chihuahua ( along with Baja California ) is the only state in Mexico to have two cities ranked in the top 20 most populated . El Paso and Ciudad Juárez comprise one of the largest binational metropolitan areas in the world with a combined population of 2.4 million . In fact , Ciudad Juárez is one of the fastest growing cities in the world in spite of the fact that it is " the most violent zone in the world outside of declared war zones " . For instance , a few years ago the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas published that in Ciudad Juárez " the average annual growth over the 10-year period 1990–2000 was 5.3 percent . Juárez experienced much higher population growth than the state of Chihuahua and than Mexico as a whole " . Chihuahua City has one of the highest literacy rates in the country at 98 % ; 35 % of the population is aged 14 or below , 60 % 15-65 , and 5 % over 65 . The growth rate is 2.4 % . The 76.5 % of the population of the state of Chihuahua live in cities which makes the state one of the most urbanized in Mexico .
In 2013 , the league expanded with the addition of two new franchises to play in 2014 , the Los Angeles Kiss ( owned by Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley of the legendary rock band Kiss ) and the Portland Thunder .
The GameCube and Wii versions feature several minor differences in their controls . The Wii version of the game makes use of the motion sensors and built-in speaker of the Wii Remote . The speaker emits the sounds of a bowstring when shooting an arrow , Midna 's laugh when she gives advice to Link , and the series ' trademark " chime " when discovering secrets . The player controls Link 's sword by swinging the Wii Remote . Other attacks are triggered using similar gestures with the Nunchuk . Unique to the GameCube version is the ability for the player to control the camera freely , without entering a special " lookaround " mode required by the Wii ; however , in the GameCube version , only two of Link 's secondary weapons can be equipped at a time , as opposed to four in the Wii version .

In the 1770s Pierre Jaquet-Droz , a Swiss watchmaker , built a mechanical doll ( automata ) that could write holding a quill pen . By switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters , and hence different messages , could be produced . In effect , it could be mechanically " programmed " to read instructions . Along with two other complex machines , the doll is at the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuchâtel , Switzerland , and still operates .
Cognitive neuroscientists consider memory as the retention , reactivation , and reconstruction of the experience-independent internal representation . The term of internal representation implies that such definition of memory contains two components : the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level , and the underpinning physical neural changes ( Dudai 2007 ) . The latter component is also called engram or memory traces ( Semon 1904 ) . Some neuroscientists and psychologists mistakenly equate the concept of engram and memory , broadly conceiving all persisting after-effects of experiences as memory ; others argue against this notion that memory does not exist until it is revealed in behavior or thought ( Moscovitch 2007 ) .
Asthma is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms , forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV1 ) , and peak expiratory flow rate . Asthma may also be classified as atopic ( extrinsic ) or non-atopic ( intrinsic ) , based on whether symptoms are precipitated by allergens ( atopic ) or not ( non-atopic ) . While asthma is classified based on severity , at the moment there is no clear method for classifying different subgroups of asthma beyond this system . Finding ways to identify subgroups that respond well to different types of treatments is a current critical goal of asthma research .
In Paris ' Roman era , its main cemetery was located to the outskirts of the Left Bank settlement , but this changed with the rise of Catholicism , where most every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes . With Paris ' growth many of these , particularly the city 's largest cemetery , les Innocents , were filled to overflowing , creating quite unsanitary conditions for the capital . When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786 , the contents of all Paris ' parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of Paris ' stone mines outside the " Porte d'Enfer " city gate , today place Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th arrondissement . The process of moving bones from Cimetière des Innocents to the catacombs took place between 1786 and 1814 ; part of the network of tunnels and remains can be visited today on the official tour of the catacombs .
Two recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the Thames in the London area . In 1999 , the remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the foreshore north of Vauxhall Bridge . This bridge either crossed the Thames , or went to a now lost island in the river . Dendrology dated the timbers to 1500 BC . In 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure , dated to 4500 BC , were found on the Thames foreshore , south of Vauxhall Bridge . The function of the mesolithic structure is not known . Both structures are on South Bank , at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the River Thames .
After the Lisa 's announcement , John Dvorak discussed rumors of a mysterious " MacIntosh " project at Apple in February 1983 . The company announced the Macintosh 128K—manufactured at an Apple factory in Fremont , California—in October 1983 , followed by an 18-page brochure included with various magazines in December . The Macintosh was introduced by a US $ 1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial , " 1984 " . It most notably aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22 , 1984 , and is now considered a " watershed event " and a " masterpiece . " Regis McKenna called the ad " more successful than the Mac itself . " " 1984 " used an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh ( indicated by a Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top ) as a means of saving humanity from the " conformity " of IBM 's attempts to dominate the computer industry . The ad alludes to George Orwell 's novel , Nineteen Eighty-Four , which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised " Big Brother . "
Oklahoma City is protected by the Oklahoma City Fire Department ( OKCFD ) , which employs 1015 paid , professional firefighters . The current Chief of Department is G. Keith Bryant , the department is also commanded by three Deputy Chiefs , who – along with the department chief – oversee the Operational Services , Prevention Services , and Support Services bureaus . The OKCFD currently operates out of 37 fire stations , located throughout the city in six battalions . The OKCFD also operates a fire apparatus fleet of 36 engines ( including 30 paramedic engines ) , 13 ladders , 16 brush patrol units , six water tankers , two hazardous materials units , one Technical Rescue Unit , one Air Supply Unit , six Arson Investigation Units , and one Rehabilitation Unit . Each engine is staffed with a driver , an officer , and one to two firefighters , while each ladder company is staffed with a driver , an officer , and one firefighter . Minimum staffing per shift is 213 personnel . The Oklahoma City Fire Department responds to over 70,000 emergency calls annually .
Tajikistan means the " Land of the Tajiks " . The suffix " -stan " ( Persian : ـستان‎‎ -stān ) is Persian for " place of " or " country " and Tajik is , most likely , the name of a pre-Islamic ( before the seventh century A.D. ) tribe . According to the Library of Congress 's 1997 Country Study of Tajikistan , it is difficult to definitively state the origins of the word " Tajik " because the term is " embroiled in twentieth-century political disputes about whether Turkic or Iranian peoples were the original inhabitants of Central Asia . "
Capital punishment was suspended in the United States from 1972 through 1976 primarily as a result of the Supreme Court 's decision in Furman v. Georgia . The last pre-Furman execution was that of Luis Monge on June 2 , 1967 . In this case , the court found that the death penalty was being imposed in an unconstitutional manner , on the grounds of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution . The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be per se unconstitutional .
Poultry is available fresh or frozen , as whole birds or as joints ( cuts ) , bone-in or deboned , seasoned in various ways , raw or ready cooked . The meatiest parts of a bird are the flight muscles on its chest , called " breast " meat , and the walking muscles on the legs , called the " thigh " and " drumstick " . The wings are also eaten ( Buffalo wings are a popular example in the United States ) and may be split into three segments , the meatier " drumette " , the " wingette " ( also called the " flat " ) , and the wing tip ( also called the " flapper " ) . In Japan , the wing is frequently separated , and these parts are referred to as 手羽元 ( teba-moto " wing base " ) and 手羽先 ( teba-saki " wing tip " ) .
It is speculated by some archaeologists that Sumerian speakers were farmers who moved down from the north , after perfecting irrigation agriculture there . The Ubaid pottery of southern Mesopotamia has been connected via Choga Mami transitional ware to the pottery of the Samarra period culture ( c. 5700 – 4900 BC C-14 ) in the north , who were the first to practice a primitive form of irrigation agriculture along the middle Tigris River and its tributaries . The connection is most clearly seen at Tell Awayli ( Oueilli , Oueili ) near Larsa , excavated by the French in the 1980s , where eight levels yielded pre-Ubaid pottery resembling Samarran ware . According to this theory , farming peoples spread down into southern Mesopotamia because they had developed a temple-centered social organization for mobilizing labor and technology for water control , enabling them to survive and prosper in a difficult environment .

Evidence exists that native peoples traveled through Oklahoma as early as the last ice age . Ancestors of the Wichita and Caddo lived in what is now Oklahoma . The Panhandle culture peoples were precontact residents of the panhandle region . The westernmost center of the Mississippian culture was Spiro Mounds , in what is now Spiro , Oklahoma , which flourished between AD 850 and 1450 . Spaniard Francisco Vásquez de Coronado traveled through the state in 1541 , but French explorers claimed the area in the 1700s and it remained under French rule until 1803 , when all the French territory west of the Mississippi River was purchased by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase .
This dissociation aims to make the early steps ( offering , promising , requesting an advantage ) of a corrupt deal already an offence and , thus , to give a clear signal ( from a criminal-policy point-of-view ) that bribery is not acceptable . [ citation needed ] Furthermore , such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties ( the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker ) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal . In addition , there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding , for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a " fee " to the decision maker to obtain a favorable decision . A working definition of corruption is also provided as follows in article 3 of the Civil Law Convention on Corruption ( ETS 174 ) : For the purpose of this Convention , " corruption " means requesting , offering , giving or accepting , directly or indirectly , a bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof , which distorts the proper performance of any duty or behavior required of the recipient of the bribe , the undue advantage or the prospect thereof .
A perceived turning point was when Blair controversially allied himself with US President George W. Bush in supporting the Iraq War , which caused him to lose much of his political support . The UN Secretary-General , among many , considered the war illegal . The Iraq War was deeply unpopular in most western countries , with Western governments divided in their support and under pressure from worldwide popular protests . The decisions that led up to the Iraq war and its subsequent conduct are currently the subject of Sir John Chilcot 's Iraq Inquiry .
The design and function of department stores in Germany followed the lead of London , Paris and New York . Germany used to have a number of department stores ; nowadays only a few of them remain . Next to some smaller , independent department stores these are Karstadt ( in 2010 taken over by Nicolas Berggruen , also operating the KaDeWe in Berlin , the Alsterhaus in Hamburg and the Oberpollinger in Munich ) , GALERIA Kaufhof ( part of the Metro AG ) . Others like Hertie , Wertheim and Horten AG were taken over by others and either fully integrated or later closed .
The ceremonial county of Somerset consists of a two-tier non-metropolitan county , which is administered by Somerset County Council and five district councils , and two unitary authority areas ( whose councils combine the functions of a county and a district ) . The five districts of Somerset are West Somerset , South Somerset , Taunton Deane , Mendip , and Sedgemoor . The two unitary authorities — which were established on 1 April 1996 following the break-up of the short-lived county of Avon — are North Somerset , and Bath & North East Somerset .
Frederick Lynch , the author of Invisible Victims : White Males and the Crisis of Affirmative Action , did a study on white males that said they were victims of reverse discrimination . Lynch explains that these white men felt frustrated and unfairly victimized by affirmative action . Shelby Steele , another author against affirmative action , wanted to see affirmative action go back to its original meaning of enforcing equal opportunity . He argued that blacks had to take full responsibility in their education and in maintaining a job . Steele believes that there is still a long way to go in America to reach our goals of eradicating discrimination .
In 1821 , Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of Neptune 's neighbour Uranus . Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables , leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational interaction . In 1843 , John Couch Adams began work on the orbit of Uranus using the data he had . Via Cambridge Observatory director James Challis , he requested extra data from Sir George Airy , the Astronomer Royal , who supplied it in February 1844 . Adams continued to work in 1845–46 and produced several different estimates of a new planet .
There are many different patterns of gas exchange demonstrated by different groups of insects . Gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous and diffusive ventilation , to discontinuous gas exchange . :65–68 During continuous gas exchange , oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released in a continuous cycle . In discontinuous gas exchange , however , the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at rest . Diffusive ventilation is simply a form of continuous gas exchange that occurs by diffusion rather than physically taking in the oxygen . Some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration . As larvae , many insects have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water , while others need to rise to the water surface to replenish air supplies which may be held or trapped in special structures .
The first President of the Bank was Wim Duisenberg , the former president of the Dutch central bank and the European Monetary Institute . While Duisenberg had been the head of the EMI ( taking over from Alexandre Lamfalussy of Belgium ) just before the ECB came into existence , the French government wanted Jean-Claude Trichet , former head of the French central bank , to be the ECB 's first president . The French argued that since the ECB was to be located in Germany , its president should be French . This was opposed by the German , Dutch and Belgian governments who saw Duisenberg as a guarantor of a strong euro . Tensions were abated by a gentleman 's agreement in which Duisenberg would stand down before the end of his mandate , to be replaced by Trichet .
In the Low Middle Ages , Catalan went through a golden age , reaching a peak of maturity and cultural richness . Examples include the work of Majorcan polymath Ramon Llull ( 1232–1315 ) , the Four Great Chronicles ( 13th–14th centuries ) , and the Valencian school of poetry culminating in Ausiàs March ( 1397–1459 ) . By the 15th century , the city of Valencia had become the sociocultural center of the Crown of Aragon , and Catalan was present all over the Mediterranean world . During this period , the Royal Chancery propagated a highly standardized language . Catalan was widely used as an official language in Sicily until the 15th century , and in Sardinia until the 17th . During this period , the language was what Costa Carreras terms " one of the 'great languages ' of medieval Europe " .
In 1838 the situation was slightly the same as in 1831 . Muhammad Ali of Egypt was not happy about lack of his control and power in Syria , he resumed military actions . The Ottoman army lost to Egyptians at the Battle of Nezib on June 24 , 1839 . The Ottoman Empire was saved by Great Britain , Austria , Prussia and Russia by signing a convention in London in July 15 , 1840 to grant Muhammad Ali and his descendants the right to inherit power in Egypt in exchange for removal of Egyptian military forces from Syria and Lebanon . Moreover , Muhammad Ali had to admit a formal dependence from the Ottoman sultan . After Muhammad Ali refused to obey the requirements of the London convention , the allied Anglo-Austrian fleet blocked the Delta , bombarded Beirut and captured Acre . Muhammad Ali accepted the conditions of the London convention in 1840 .
High hopes for the AFL waned when interim commissioner Ed Policy announced his resignation , citing the obsolescence of his position in the reformatted league . Two weeks later , the Los Angeles Avengers announced that they were formally folding the franchise . One month later , the league missed the deadline to formally ratify the new collective bargaining agreement and announced that it was eliminating health insurance for the players . Progress on the return stalled , and no announcements were made regarding the future of the league .
During the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony and only six weeks before the wedding of Charles , Prince of Wales , and Lady Diana Spencer , six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down The Mall on her horse , Burmese . Police later discovered that the shots were blanks . The 17-year-old assailant , Marcus Sarjeant , was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three . The Queen 's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised . From April to September 1982 , the Queen remained anxious but proud of her son , Prince Andrew , who was serving with British forces during the Falklands War . On 9 July , the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder , Michael Fagan , in the room with her . Remaining calm and through two calls to the Palace police switchboard , she spoke to Fagan while he sat at the foot of her bed until assistance arrived seven minutes later . Though she hosted US President Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visited his Californian ranch in 1983 , she was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada , one of her Caribbean realms , without informing her .
Because the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials , a given bipolar n–p–n transistor tends to be swifter than an equivalent p–n–p transistor . GaAs has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors . It is for this reason that GaAs is used in high-frequency applications . A relatively recent FET development , the high-electron-mobility transistor ( HEMT ) , has a heterostructure ( junction between different semiconductor materials ) of aluminium gallium arsenide ( AlGaAs ) -gallium arsenide ( GaAs ) which has twice the electron mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction . Because of their high speed and low noise , HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12 GHz . HEMTs based on gallium nitride and aluminium gallium nitride ( AlGaN/GaN HEMTs ) provide a still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications .
Utrecht city has an active cultural life , and in the Netherlands is second only to Amsterdam . There are several theatres and theatre companies . The 1941 main city theatre was built by Dudok . Besides theatres there is a large number of cinemas including three arthouse cinemas . Utrecht is host to the international Early Music Festival ( Festival Oude Muziek , for music before 1800 ) and the Netherlands Film Festival . The city has an important classical music hall Vredenburg ( 1979 by Herman Hertzberger ) . Its acoustics are considered among the best of the 20th-century original music halls . [ citation needed ] The original Vredenburg music hall has been redeveloped as part of the larger station area redevelopment plan and in 2014 has gained additional halls that allowed its merger with the rock club Tivoli and the SJU jazzpodium . There are several other venues for music throughout the city . Young musicians are educated in the conservatory , a department of the Utrecht School of the Arts . There is a specialised museum of automatically playing musical instruments .
As the century wore on , the factions slowly began to adopt more coherent political tendencies as the interests of their power bases began to diverge . The Whig party 's initial base of support from the great aristocratic families , widened to include the emerging industrial interests and wealthy merchants . As well as championing constitutional monarchy with strict limits on the monarch 's power , the Whigs adamantly opposed a Catholic king as a threat to liberty , and believed in extending toleration to nonconformist Protestants , or dissenters . A major influence on the Whigs were the liberal political ideas of John Locke , and the concepts of universal rights employed by Locke and Algernon Sidney .
The term Carnival is traditionally used in areas with a large Catholic presence . However , the Philippines , a predominantly Roman Catholic country , does not celebrate Carnival anymore since the dissolution of the Manila Carnival after 1939 , the last carnival in the country . In historically Lutheran countries , the celebration is known as Fastelavn , and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans and Methodists , pre-Lenten celebrations , along with penitential observances , occur on Shrove Tuesday . In Eastern Orthodox nations , Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent . In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands , the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 ( often at 11:11 a.m. ) . This dates back to celebrations before the Advent season or with harvest celebrations of St. Martin 's Day .
Assembly of desktop computers for the North American market formerly took place at Dell plants in Austin , Texas ( original location ) and Lebanon , Tennessee ( opened in 1999 ) , which have been closed in 2008 and early 2009 , respectively . The plant in Winston-Salem , North Carolina received $ 280 million USD in incentives from the state and opened in 2005 , but ceased operations in November 2010 , and Dell 's contract with the state requires them to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions . Most of the work that used to take place in Dell 's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico , or some of Dell 's own factories overseas . The Miami , Florida facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation , while Dell continues to produce its servers ( its most profitable products ) in Austin , Texas .
Bioscience is the overall major in which undergraduate students who are interested in general well-being take in college . Immunology is a branch of bioscience for undergraduate programs but the major gets specified as students move on for graduate program in immunology . The aim of immunology is to study the health of humans and animals through effective yet consistent research , ( AAAAI , 2013 ) . The most important thing about being immunologists is the research because it is the biggest portion of their jobs .
Each season premieres with the audition round , taking place in different cities . The audition episodes typically feature a mix of potential finalists , interesting characters and woefully inadequate contestants . Each successful contestant receives a golden ticket to proceed on to the next round in Hollywood . Based on their performances during the Hollywood round ( Las Vegas round for seasons 10 onwards ) , 24 to 36 contestants are selected by the judges to participate in the semifinals . From the semifinal onwards the contestants perform their songs live , with the judges making their critiques after each performance . The contestants are voted for by the viewing public , and the outcome of the public votes is then revealed in the results show typically on the following night . The results shows feature group performances by the contestants as well as guest performers . The Top-three results show also features the homecoming events for the Top 3 finalists . The season reaches its climax in a two-hour results finale show , where the winner of the season is revealed .
Data compression can be viewed as a special case of data differencing : Data differencing consists of producing a difference given a source and a target , with patching producing a target given a source and a difference , while data compression consists of producing a compressed file given a target , and decompression consists of producing a target given only a compressed file . Thus , one can consider data compression as data differencing with empty source data , the compressed file corresponding to a " difference from nothing . " This is the same as considering absolute entropy ( corresponding to data compression ) as a special case of relative entropy ( corresponding to data differencing ) with no initial data .
White LEDs can also be made by coating near-ultraviolet ( NUV ) LEDs with a mixture of high-efficiency europium-based phosphors that emit red and blue , plus copper and aluminium-doped zinc sulfide ( ZnS : Cu , Al ) that emits green . This is a method analogous to the way fluorescent lamps work . This method is less efficient than blue LEDs with YAG : Ce phosphor , as the Stokes shift is larger , so more energy is converted to heat , but yields light with better spectral characteristics , which render color better . Due to the higher radiative output of the ultraviolet LEDs than of the blue ones , both methods offer comparable brightness . A concern is that UV light may leak from a malfunctioning light source and cause harm to human eyes or skin .
Sheahon Zenger was introduced as KU 's new athletic director in January 2011 . Under former athletic director Lew Perkins , the department 's budget increased from $ 27.2 million in 2003 ( 10th in the conference ) to currently over $ 50 million thanks in large part to money raised from a new priority seating policy at Allen Fieldhouse , a new $ 26.67 million eight-year contract with Adidas replacing an existing contract with Nike , and a new $ 40.2 million seven-year contract with ESPN Regional Television . The additional funds brought improvements to the university , including :
The competition formed as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League , which was originally founded in 1888 , and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal . The deal was worth £1 billion a year domestically as of 2013–14 , with BSkyB and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively . The league generates €2.2 billion per year in domestic and international television rights . In 2014/15 , teams were apportioned revenues of £1.6 billion .
At the same time the order found itself face to face with the Renaissance . It struggled against pagan tendencies in Renaissance humanism , in Italy through Dominici and Savonarola , in Germany through the theologians of Cologne but it also furnished humanism with such advanced writers as Francesco Colonna ( probably the writer of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili ) and Matteo Bandello . Many Dominicans took part in the artistic activity of the age , the most prominent being Fra Angelico and Fra Bartolomeo .
At age eight , Beyoncé and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group . They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl 's Tyme , and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston . After seeing the group , R & B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search , the largest talent show on national TV at the time . Girl 's Tyme failed to win , and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good . In 1995 Beyoncé 's father resigned from his job to manage the group . The move reduced Beyoncé 's family 's income by half , and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments . Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R & B girl groups . The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records , moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording , only to be cut by the company . This put further strain on the family , and Beyoncé 's parents separated . On October 5 , 1995 , Dwayne Wiggins 's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group . In 1996 , the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music , the Knowles family reunited , and shortly after , the group got a contract with Columbia Records .
The economy relies heavily on investment and support from Armenians abroad . Before independence , Armenia 's economy was largely industry-based – chemicals , electronics , machinery , processed food , synthetic rubber , and textile – and highly dependent on outside resources . The republic had developed a modern industrial sector , supplying machine tools , textiles , and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy . Recently , the Intel Corporation agreed to open a research center in Armenia , in addition to other technology companies , signalling the growth of the technology industry in Armenia .
Apple spent $ 2.5 million purchasing all 39 advertising pages in a special , post-election issue of Newsweek , and ran a " Test Drive a Macintosh " promotion , in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards . While 200,000 people participated , dealers disliked the promotion , the supply of computers was insufficient for demand , and many were returned in such a bad condition that they could no longer be sold . This marketing campaign caused CEO John Sculley to raise the price from US $ 1,995 to US $ 2,495 ( about $ 5,200 when adjusted for inflation in 2010 ) . The computer sold well , nonetheless , reportedly outselling the IBM PCjr which also began shipping early that year . By April 1984 the company sold 50,000 Macintoshes , and hoped for 70,000 by early May and almost 250,000 by the end of the year .
Most birds can fly , which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes . Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding , feeding , and predator avoidance and escape . Birds have various adaptations for flight , including a lightweight skeleton , two large flight muscles , the pectoralis ( which accounts for 15 % of the total mass of the bird ) and the supracoracoideus , as well as a modified forelimb ( wing ) that serves as an aerofoil . Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species ' type of flight ; many birds combine powered , flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight . About 60 extant bird species are flightless , as were many extinct birds . Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands , probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators . Though flightless , penguins use similar musculature and movements to " fly " through the water , as do auks , shearwaters and dippers .
In modern times , a process of devolution in the United Kingdom has decentralised power once again . Since the 1997 referendums in Scotland and Wales and the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland , three of the four constituent countries of the UK now have some level of autonomy . Government has been devolved to the Scottish Parliament , the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly . England does not have its own parliament and English affairs continue to be decided by the Westminster Parliament . In 1998 a set of eight unelected Regional assemblies , or chambers , was created to support the English Regional Development Agencies , but these were abolished between 2008 and 2010 . The Regions of England continue to be used in certain governmental administrative functions .
Heritage buildings constructed during the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras showcase Indo-Islamic architecture influenced by Medieval , Mughal and European styles . After the 1908 flooding of the Musi River , the city was expanded and civic monuments constructed , particularly during the rule of Mir Osman Ali Khan ( the VIIth Nizam ) , whose patronage of architecture led to him being referred to as the maker of modern Hyderabad . In 2012 , the government of India declared Hyderabad the first " Best heritage city of India " .
In 1822 , the citizens of Boston voted to change the official name from " the Town of Boston " to " the City of Boston " , and on March 4 , 1822 , the people of Boston accepted the charter incorporating the City . At the time Boston was chartered as a city , the population was about 46,226 , while the area of the city was only 4.7 square miles ( 12 km2 ) .
Located in the Laurelhurst neighborhood , Seattle Children 's , formerly Children 's Hospital and Regional Medical Center , is the pediatric referral center for Washington , Alaska , Montana , and Idaho . The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has a campus in the Eastlake neighborhood . The University District is home to the University of Washington Medical Center which , along with Harborview , is operated by the University of Washington . Seattle is also served by a Veterans Affairs hospital on Beacon Hill , a third campus of Swedish in Ballard , and Northwest Hospital and Medical Center near Northgate Mall .
Allied submarines did not adopt a defensive posture and wait for the enemy to attack . Within hours after the Pearl Harbor attack , in retribution against Japan , Roosevelt promulgated a new doctrine : unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan . This meant sinking any warship , commercial vessel , or passenger ship in Axis-controlled waters , without warning and without help to survivors . [ nb 13 ] At the outbreak of the war in the Pacific the Dutch Admiral in charge of the naval defense of the East Indies , Conrad Helfrich , gave instructions to wage war aggressively . His small force of submarines sank more Japanese ships in the first weeks of the war than the entire British and US navies together , an exploit which earned him the nickname " Ship-a-day Helfrich " . The Dutch force were in fact the first to sink an enemy warship ; On 24 December 1941 , HNLMS K XVI torpedoed and sank the Japanese destroyer Sagiri .
A standard dialect ( also known as a standardized dialect or " standard language " ) is a dialect that is supported by institutions . Such institutional support may include government recognition or designation ; presentation as being the " correct " form of a language in schools ; published grammars , dictionaries , and textbooks that set forth a correct spoken and written form ; and an extensive formal literature that employs that dialect ( prose , poetry , non-fiction , etc. ) . There may be multiple standard dialects associated with a single language . For example , Standard American English , Standard British English , Standard Canadian English , Standard Indian English , Standard Australian English , and Standard Philippine English may all be said to be standard dialects of the English language .
The above are further subdivided into 31 planes of existence . [ web 4 ] Rebirths in some of the higher heavens , known as the Śuddhāvāsa Worlds or Pure Abodes , can be attained only by skilled Buddhist practitioners known as anāgāmis ( non-returners ) . Rebirths in the Ārūpyadhātu ( formless realms ) can be attained by only those who can meditate on the arūpajhānas , the highest object of meditation .
After the Civil War , population expansion , railroad construction , and the disappearance of the buffalo herds heightened military tensions on the Great Plains . Several tribes , especially the Sioux and Comanche , fiercely resisted confinement to reservations . The main role of the Army was to keep indigenous peoples on reservations and to end their wars against settlers and each other , William Tecumseh Sherman and Philip Sheridan were in charge . A famous victory for the Plains Nations was the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 , when Col. George Armstrong Custer and two hundred plus members of the 7th Cavalry were killed by a force consisting of Native Americans from the Lakota , Northern Cheyenne , and Arapaho nations . The last significant conflict came in 1891 .
Regular script has been attributed to Zhong Yao , of the Eastern Han to Cao Wei period ( c. 151–230 AD ) , who has been called the " father of regular script " . However , some scholars postulate that one person alone could not have developed a new script which was universally adopted , but could only have been a contributor to its gradual formation . The earliest surviving pieces written in regular script are copies of Yao 's works , including at least one copied by Wang Xizhi . This new script , which is the dominant modern Chinese script , developed out of a neatly written form of early semi-cursive , with addition of the pause ( 頓/顿 dùn ) technique to end horizontal strokes , plus heavy tails on strokes which are written to the downward-right diagonal . Thus , early regular script emerged from a neat , formal form of semi-cursive , which had itself emerged from neo-clerical ( a simplified , convenient form of clerical script ) . It then matured further in the Eastern Jin dynasty in the hands of the " Sage of Calligraphy " , Wang Xizhi , and his son Wang Xianzhi . It was not , however , in widespread use at that time , and most writers continued using neo-clerical , or a somewhat semi-cursive form of it , for daily writing , while the conservative bafen clerical script remained in use on some stelae , alongside some semi-cursive , but primarily neo-clerical .
The Namibian Constitution adopted in February 1990 incorporated protection for human rights , compensation for state expropriations of private property , an independent judiciary and an executive presidency ( the constituent assembly became the national assembly ) . The country officially became independent on 21 March 1990 . Sam Nujoma was sworn in as the first President of Namibia watched by Nelson Mandela ( who had been released from prison the previous month ) and representatives from 147 countries , including 20 heads of state . Walvis Bay was ceded to Namibia in 1994 upon the end of Apartheid in South Africa . [ citation needed ]
The Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt considered the most important centre of the maritime transport in the Middle East , connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea . Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work , it allows ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa . The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfiq at the city of Suez . Ismailia lies on its west bank , 3 km ( 1.9 mi ) from the half-way point .
The Kinsey scale has been praised for dismissing the dichotomous classification of sexual orientation and allowing for a new perspective on human sexuality . However , the scale has been criticized because it is still not a true continuum . Despite seven categories being able to provide a more accurate description of sexual orientation than a dichotomous scale it is still difficult to determine which category individuals should be assigned to . In a major study comparing sexual response in homosexual males and females , Masters and Johnson discuss the difficulty of assigning the Kinsey ratings to participants . Particularly , they found it difficult to determine the relative amount heterosexual and homosexual experience and response in a person 's history when using the scale . They report finding it difficult to assign ratings 2-4 for individuals with a large number of heterosexual and homosexual experiences . When , there is a lot of heterosexual and homosexual experiences in one 's history it becomes difficult for that individual to be fully objective in assessing the relative amount of each .
For over a century , New Haven citizens had fought in the colonial militia alongside regular British forces , as in the French and Indian War . As the American Revolution approached , General David Wooster and other influential residents hoped that the conflict with the government in Britain could be resolved short of rebellion . On 23 April 1775 , which is still celebrated in New Haven as Powder House Day , the Second Company , Governor 's Foot Guard , of New Haven entered the struggle against the governing British parliament . Under Captain Benedict Arnold , they broke into the powder house to arm themselves and began a three-day march to Cambridge , Massachusetts . Other New Haven militia members were on hand to escort George Washington from his overnight stay in New Haven on his way to Cambridge . Contemporary reports , from both sides , remark on the New Haven volunteers ' professional military bearing , including uniforms .
Dumbwaiters are small freight elevators that are intended to carry food , books or other small freight loads rather than passengers . They often connect kitchens to rooms on other floors . they usually do not have the same safety features found in passenger elevators , like various ropes for redundancy . they have a lower capacity , and they can be up to 1 meter ( 3 ft. ) tall . there 's a control panel at every stop , that mimics the ones found in passenger elevators , like calling , door control , floor selection .
The Early Jurassic spans from 200 million years to 175 million years ago . The climate was much more humid than the Triassic , and as a result , the world was very tropical . In the oceans , Plesiosaurs , Ichthyosaurs and Ammonites fill waters as the dominant races of the seas . On land , dinosaurs and other reptiles stake their claim as the dominant race of the land , with species such as Dilophosaurus at the top . The first true crocodiles evolved , pushing out the large amphibians to near extinction . All-in-all , reptiles rise to rule the world . Meanwhile , the first true mammals evolve , but remained relatively small sized .
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 ( ESA ; 16 U.S.C . § 1531 et seq . ) is one of the few dozens of United States environmental laws passed in the 1970s , and serves as the enacting legislation to carry out the provisions outlined in The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) . The ESA was signed into law by President Richard Nixon on December 28 , 1973 , it was designed to protect critically imperiled species from extinction as a " consequence of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation . " The U.S. Supreme Court found that " the plain intent of Congress in enacting " the ESA " was to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction , whatever the cost . " The Act is administered by two federal agencies , the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ( FWS ) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
Immanuel Kant ( 1724–1804 ) tried to reconcile rationalism and religious belief , individual freedom and political authority , as well as map out a view of the public sphere through private and public reason . Kant 's work continued to shape German thought , and indeed all of European philosophy , well into the 20th century . Mary Wollstonecraft was one of England 's earliest feminist philosophers . She argued for a society based on reason , and that women , as well as men , should be treated as rational beings . She is best known for her work A Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1791 ) .
In Theravāda Buddhism , the cause of human existence and suffering is identified as craving , which carries with it the various defilements . These various defilements are traditionally summed up as greed , hatred and delusion . These are believed deeply rooted afflictions of the mind that create suffering and stress . To be free from suffering and stress , these defilements must be permanently uprooted through internal investigation , analyzing , experiencing , and understanding of the true nature of those defilements by using jhāna , a technique of the Noble Eightfold Path . It then leads the meditator to realize the Four Noble Truths , Enlightenment and Nibbāna . Nibbāna is the ultimate goal of Theravadins .
During up-peak mode ( also called moderate incoming traffic ) , elevator cars in a group are recalled to the lobby to provide expeditious service to passengers arriving at the building , most typically in the morning as people arrive for work or at the conclusion of a lunch-time period . Elevators are dispatched one-by-one when they reach a pre-determined passenger load , or when they have had their doors opened for a certain period of time . The next elevator to be dispatched usually has its hall lantern or a " this car leaving next " sign illuminated to encourage passengers to make maximum use of the available elevator system capacity . Some elevator banks are programmed so that at least one car will always return to the lobby floor and park whenever it becomes free .
In February 1925 , the Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri summoned him to the Vatican and informed him of Pope Pius XI 's decision to appoint him as the Apostolic Visitor to Bulgaria ( 1925–35 ) . On 3 March , Pius XI also named him for consecration as titular archbishop of Areopolis , Jordan . Roncalli was initially reluctant about a mission to Bulgaria , but he would soon relent . His nomination as apostolic visitor was made official on 19 March . Roncalli was consecrated by Giovanni Tacci Porcelli in the church of San Carlo alla Corso in Rome . After he was consecrated , he introduced his family to Pope Pius XI . He chose as his episcopal motto Obedientia et Pax ( " Obedience and Peace " ) , which became his guiding motto . While he was in Bulgaria , an earthquake struck in a town not too far from where he was . Unaffected , he wrote to his sisters Ancilla and Maria and told them both that he was fine .
Continuing his experiments in Brantford , Bell brought home a working model of his telephone . On August 3 , 1876 , from the telegraph office in Mount Pleasant five miles ( eight km ) away from Brantford , Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready . With curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses , faint voices were heard replying . The following night , he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford , four miles ( six km ) distant , along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences , and laid through a tunnel . This time , guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing . These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances .
As of the early 21st century , Christianity has approximately 2.4 billion adherents . The faith represents about a third of the world 's population and is the largest religion in the world . Christians have composed about 33 percent of the world 's population for around 100 years . The largest Christian denomination is the Roman Catholic Church , with 1.17 billion adherents , representing half of all Christians .
China Mobile had more than 2,300 base stations suspended due to power disruption or severe telecommunication traffic congestion . Half of the wireless communications were lost in the Sichuan province . China Unicom 's service in Wenchuan and four nearby counties was cut off , with more than 700 towers suspended .
Flower ontogeny uses a combination of genes normally responsible for forming new shoots . The most primitive flowers probably had a variable number of flower parts , often separate from ( but in contact with ) each other . The flowers tended to grow in a spiral pattern , to be bisexual ( in plants , this means both male and female parts on the same flower ) , and to be dominated by the ovary ( female part ) . As flowers evolved , some variations developed parts fused together , with a much more specific number and design , and with either specific sexes per flower or plant or at least " ovary-inferior " .
The U.S. Census Bureau reports a 2010 population of 129,779 , with 47,094 households and 25,854 families within the city of New Haven . The population density is 6,859.8 people per square mile ( 2,648.6/km² ) . There are 52,941 housing units at an average density of 2,808.5 per square mile ( 1,084.4/km² ) . The racial makeup of the city is 42.6 % White , 35.4 % African American , 0.5 % Native American , 4.6 % Asian , 0.1 % Pacific Islander , 12.9 % from other races , and 3.9 % from two or more races . Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 27.4 % of the population . Non-Hispanic Whites were 31.8 % of the population in 2010 , down from 69.6 % in 1970 . The city 's demography is shifting rapidly : New Haven has always been a city of immigrants and currently the Latino population is growing rapidly . Previous influxes among ethnic groups have been African-Americans in the postwar era , and Irish , Italian and ( to a lesser degree ) Slavic peoples in the prewar period .
In the beginning of 1996 , several human rights groups brought cases to hold Shell accountable for alleged human rights violations in Nigeria , including summary execution , crimes against humanity , torture , inhumane treatment and arbitrary arrest and detention . In particular , Shell stood accused of collaborating in the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other leaders of the Ogoni tribe of southern Nigeria , who were hanged in 1995 by Nigeria 's then military rulers . The lawsuits were brought against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson , the head of its Nigerian operation . In 2009 , Shell agreed to pay $ 15.5m in a legal settlement . Shell has not accepted any liability over the allegations against it .
Three of the women claimed he had grabbed their breasts , a fourth said he placed his hand under her skirt on her buttock . A fifth woman claimed Schwarzenegger tried to take off her bathing suit in a hotel elevator , and the last said he pulled her onto his lap and asked her about a sex act .
Some experiments on very resinous Longleaf Pine specimens indicate an increase in strength , due to the resin which increases the strength when dry . Such resin-saturated heartwood is called " fat lighter " . Structures built of fat lighter are almost impervious to rot and termites ; however they are very flammable . Stumps of old longleaf pines are often dug , split into small pieces and sold as kindling for fires . Stumps thus dug may actually remain a century or more since being cut . Spruce impregnated with crude resin and dried is also greatly increased in strength thereby .
Feynman was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society ( ForMemRS ) in 1965 . At this time in the early 1960s , Feynman exhausted himself by working on multiple major projects at the same time , including a request , while at Caltech , to " spruce up " the teaching of undergraduates . After three years devoted to the task , he produced a series of lectures that eventually became The Feynman Lectures on Physics . He wanted a picture of a drumhead sprinkled with powder to show the modes of vibration at the beginning of the book . Concerned over the connections to drugs and rock and roll that could be made from the image , the publishers changed the cover to plain red , though they included a picture of him playing drums in the foreword . The Feynman Lectures on Physics occupied two physicists , Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands , as part-time co-authors for several years . Even though the books were not adopted by most universities as textbooks , they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics . Many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books , including The Character of Physical Law , QED : The Strange Theory of Light and Matter , Statistical Mechanics , Lectures on Gravitation , and the Feynman Lectures on Computation .
Southampton Water has the benefit of a double high tide , with two high tide peaks , making the movement of large ships easier . This is not caused as popularly supposed by the presence of the Isle of Wight , but is a function of the shape and depth of the English Channel . In this area the general water flow is distorted by more local conditions reaching across to France .
At the time of her accession , the government was led by the Whig prime minister Lord Melbourne , who at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced Queen , who relied on him for advice . Charles Greville supposed that the widowed and childless Melbourne was " passionately fond of her as he might be of his daughter if he had one " , and Victoria probably saw him as a father figure . Her coronation took place on 28 June 1838 at Westminster Abbey . Over 400,000 visitors came to London for the celebrations . She became the first sovereign to take up residence at Buckingham Palace and inherited the revenues of the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall as well as being granted a civil list allowance of £385,000 per year . Financially prudent , she paid off her father 's debts .
There is a variety of annual events , beginning with the relatively new New Year 's Day Parade , fireworks display at the London Eye , the world 's second largest street party , the Notting Hill Carnival is held during the late August Bank Holiday each year . Traditional parades include November 's Lord Mayor 's Show , a centuries-old event celebrating the annual appointment of a new Lord Mayor of the City of London with a procession along the streets of the City , and June 's Trooping the Colour , a formal military pageant performed by regiments of the Commonwealth and British armies to celebrate the Queen 's Official Birthday .
Domestically , Menzies presided over a fairly regulated economy in which utilities were publicly owned , and commercial activity was highly regulated through centralised wage-fixing and high tariff protection . Liberal leaders from Menzies to Malcolm Fraser generally maintained Australia 's high tariff levels . At that time the Liberals ' coalition partner , the Country Party , the older of the two in the coalition ( now known as the " National Party " ) , had considerable influence over the government 's economic policies . It was not until the late 1970s and through their period out of power federally in the 1980s that the party came to be influenced by what was known as the " New Right " – a conservative liberal group who advocated market deregulation , privatisation of public utilities , reductions in the size of government programs and tax cuts .
The Spanish governor was expelled in 1814 . In 1816 , Portugal invaded the recently liberated territory and in 1821 , it was annexed to the Banda Oriental of Brazil . Juan Antonio Lavalleja and his band called the Treinta y Tres Orientales ( " Thirty-Three Orientals " ) re-established the independence of the region in 1825 . Uruguay was consolidated as an independent state in 1828 , with Montevideo as the nation 's capital . In 1829 , the demolition of the city 's fortifications began and plans were made for an extension beyond the Ciudad Vieja , referred to as the " Ciudad Nueva " ( " new city " ) . Urban expansion , however , moved very slowly because of the events that followed .
The use of the term for the Iranian language family was introduced in 1836 by Christian Lassen . Robert Needham Cust used the term Irano-Aryan in 1878 , and Orientalists such as George Abraham Grierson and Max Müller contrasted Irano-Aryan ( Iranian ) and Indo-Aryan ( Indic ) . Some recent scholarship , primarily in German , has revived this convention .
A group is called finite if it has a finite number of elements . The number of elements is called the order of the group . An important class is the symmetric groups SN , the groups of permutations of N letters . For example , the symmetric group on 3 letters S3 is the group consisting of all possible orderings of the three letters ABC , i.e . contains the elements ABC , ACB , ... , up to CBA , in total 6 ( or 3 factorial ) elements . This class is fundamental insofar as any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group SN for a suitable integer N ( Cayley 's theorem ) . Parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above , S3 can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle .
On November 17 , 1987 , SCA acquired CBS Records , which hosted such acts as Michael Jackson , for US $ 2 billion . CBS Inc. , now CBS Corporation , retained the rights to the CBS name for music recordings but granted Sony a temporary license to use the CBS name . CBS Corporation founded a new CBS Records in 2006 , which is distributed by Sony through its RED subsidiary .
With the neoplatonist Plotinus , wrote Nathaniel Alfred Boll ; " there even appears , probably for the first time in Western philosophy , idealism that had long been current in the East even at that time , for it taught ... that the soul has made the world by stepping from eternity into time ... " . Similarly , in regard to passages from the Enneads , " The only space or place of the world is the soul " and " Time must not be assumed to exist outside the soul " , Ludwig Noiré wrote : " For the first time in Western philosophy we find idealism proper in Plotinus , However , Plotinus does not address whether we know external objects , unlike Schopenhauer and other modern philosophers .
Infrared cleaning is a technique used by some Motion picture film scanner , film scanners and flatbed scanners to reduce or remove the effect of dust and scratches upon the finished scan . It works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels ( red , green , and blue ) . The infrared channel , in combination with the other channels , is used to detect the location of scratches and dust . Once located , those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by inpainting .
Mandolin has also been used in blues music , most notably by Ry Cooder , who performed outstanding covers on his very first recordings , Yank Rachell , Johnny " Man " Young , Carl Martin , and Gerry Hundt . Howard Armstrong , who is famous for blues violin , got his start with his father 's mandolin and played in string bands similar to the other Tennessee string bands he came into contact with , with band makeup including " mandolins and fiddles and guitars and banjos . And once in a while they would ease a little ukulele in there and a bass fiddle . " Other blues players from the era 's string bands include Willie Black ( Whistler And His Jug Band ) , Dink Brister , Jim Hill , Charles Johnson , Coley Jones ( Dallas String Band ) , Bobby Leecan ( Need More Band ) , Alfred Martin , Charlie McCoy ( 1909-1950 ) , Al Miller , Matthew Prater , and Herb Quinn .
The playing time of a phonograph record depended on the turntable speed and the groove spacing . At the beginning of the 20th century , the early discs played for two minutes , the same as early cylinder records . The 12-inch disc , introduced by Victor in 1903 , increased the playing time to three and a half minutes . Because a 10-inch 78 rpm record could hold about three minutes of sound per side and the 10-inch size was the standard size for popular music , almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length . For example , when King Oliver 's Creole Jazz Band , including Louis Armstrong on his first recordings , recorded 13 sides at Gennett Records in Richmond , Indiana , in 1923 , one side was 2:09 and four sides were 2:52–2:59 .
Public expenditure health was at 8.9 % of the GDP in 2004 , whereas private expenditure was at 1.3 % . As of 2012 , the HIV/AIDS prevalence was at 2.8 % among 15- to 49-year-olds . Health expenditure was at US $ 30 per capita in 2004 . A large proportion of the population is undernourished , with malnutrition being a problem in Congo-Brazzaville . There were 20 physicians per 100,000 persons in the early 2000s ( decade ) .
Cultural depictions of dogs in art extend back thousands of years to when dogs were portrayed on the walls of caves . Representations of dogs became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed . Hunting scenes were popular in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance . Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance , protection , loyalty , fidelity , faithfulness , watchfulness , and love .
The engagement was not without controversy : Philip had no financial standing , was foreign-born ( though a British subject who had served in the Royal Navy throughout the Second World War ) , and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links . Marion Crawford wrote , " Some of the King 's advisors did not think him good enough for her . He was a prince without a home or kingdom . Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip 's foreign origin . " Elizabeth 's mother was reported , in later biographies , to have opposed the union initially , even dubbing Philip " The Hun " . In later life , however , she told biographer Tim Heald that Philip was " an English gentleman " .
Many medieval philosophers developed arguments for the existence of God , while attempting to comprehend the precise implications of God 's attributes . Reconciling some of those attributes generated important philosophical problems and debates . For example , God 's omniscience may seem to imply that God knows how free agents will choose to act . If God does know this , their ostensible free will might be illusory , or foreknowledge does not imply predestination , and if God does not know it , God may not be omniscient .
Calvary as an English name for the place is derived from the Latin word for skull ( calvaria ) , which is used in the Vulgate translation of " place of a skull " , the explanation given in all four Gospels of the Aramaic word Gûlgaltâ which was the name of the place where Jesus was crucified . The text does not indicate why it was so designated , but several theories have been put forward . One is that as a place of public execution , Calvary may have been strewn with the skulls of abandoned victims ( which would be contrary to Jewish burial traditions , but not Roman ) . Another is that Calvary is named after a nearby cemetery ( which is consistent with both of the proposed modern sites ) . A third is that the name was derived from the physical contour , which would be more consistent with the singular use of the word , i.e. , the place of " a skull " . While often referred to as " Mount Calvary " , it was more likely a small hill or rocky knoll .
USB 2.0 High-Speed Inter-Chip ( HSIC ) is a chip-to-chip variant of USB 2.0 that eliminates the conventional analog transceivers found in normal USB . It was adopted as a standard by the USB Implementers Forum in 2007 . The HSIC physical layer uses about 50 % less power and 75 % less board area compared to traditional USB 2.0 . HSIC uses two signals at 1.2 V and has a throughput of 480 Mbit/s . Maximum PCB trace length for HSIC is 10 cm . It does not have low enough latency to support RAM memory sharing between two chips .
The question of whether the government should intervene or not in the regulation of the cyberspace is a very polemical one . Indeed , for as long as it has existed and by definition , the cyberspace is a virtual space free of any government intervention . Where everyone agree that an improvement on cybersecurity is more than vital , is the government the best actor to solve this issue ? Many government officials and experts think that the government should step in and that there is a crucial need for regulation , mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem . R. Clarke said during a panel discussion at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco , he believes that the " industry only responds when you threaten regulation . If industry does n't respond ( to the threat ) , you have to follow through . " On the other hand , executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary , but think that the government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently .
The report " Mary : Faith and Hope in Christ " , by the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission , concluded that the teaching about Mary in the two definitions of the Assumption and the Immaculate Conception can be said to be consonant with the teaching of the Scriptures and the ancient common traditions . But the report expressed concerns that the Roman Catholic dogmatic definitions of these concepts implies them to be " revealed by God " , stating : " The question arises for Anglicans , however , as to whether these doctrines concerning Mary are revealed by God in a way which must be held by believers as a matter of faith . "
In 1902 , the Siemens company developed a tantalum lamp filament . These lamps were more efficient than even graphitized carbon filaments and could operate at higher temperatures . Since tantalum metal has a lower resistivity than carbon , the tantalum lamp filament was quite long and required multiple internal supports . The metal filament had the property of gradually shortening in use ; the filaments were installed with large loops that tightened in use . This made lamps in use for several hundred hours quite fragile . Metal filaments had the property of breaking and re-welding , though this would usually decrease resistance and shorten the life of the filament . General Electric bought the rights to use tantalum filaments and produced them in the US until 1913 .
Besides emptiness , Mahayana schools often place emphasis on the notions of perfected spiritual insight ( prajñāpāramitā ) and Buddha-nature ( tathāgatagarbha ) . There are conflicting interpretations of the tathāgatagarbha in Mahāyāna thought . The idea may be traced to Abhidharma , and ultimately to statements of the Buddha in the Nikāyas . In Tibetan Buddhism , according to the Sakya school , tathāgatagarbha is the inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one 's mind . In Nyingma , tathāgatagarbha also generally refers to inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one 's mind . According to the Gelug school , it is the potential for sentient beings to awaken since they are empty ( i.e . dependently originated ) . According to the Jonang school , it refers to the innate qualities of the mind that expresses themselves as omniscience etc . when adventitious obscurations are removed . The " Tathāgatagarbha Sutras " are a collection of Mahayana sutras that present a unique model of Buddha-nature . Even though this collection was generally ignored in India , East Asian Buddhism provides some significance to these texts .
In the 2011–12 season , Arsenal celebrated their 125th year anniversary . The celebrations included a modified version of the current crest worn on their jerseys for the season . The crest was all white , surrounded by 15 oak leaves to the right and 15 laurel leaves to the left . The oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the Royal Oak pub . The 15 laurel leaves represent the design detail on the six pence pieces paid by the founding fathers to establish the club . The laurel leaves also represent strength . To complete the crest , 1886 and 2011 are shown on either sides of the motto " Forward " at the bottom of the crest .
The cartridge media of the console is officially referred to as Game Pak in most Western regions , and as Cassette ( カセット , Kasetto ? ) in Japan and parts of Latin America . While the SNES can address 128 Mbit , [ f ] only 117.75 Mbit are actually available for cartridge use . A fairly normal mapping could easily address up to 95 Mbit of ROM data ( 48 Mbit at FastROM speed ) with 8 Mbit of battery-backed RAM . However , most available memory access controllers only support mappings of up to 32 Mbit . The largest games released ( Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean ) contain 48 Mbit of ROM data , while the smallest games contain only 2 Mbit .
In the past 20 years , several commercial streets have been developed , hence the nightlife has become more diverse : there are shopping malls opening late in the Xinjiekou CBD and Hunan Road . The well-established " Nanjing 1912 " district hosts a wide variety of recreational facilities ranging from traditional restaurants and western pubs to dance clubs . There are two major areas where bars are densely located ; one is in 1912 block ; the other is along Shanghai road and its neighbourhood . Both are popular with international residents of the city .
The National Incident Based Reporting System ( NIBRS ) crime statistics system aims to address limitations inherent in UCR data . The system is used by law enforcement agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes . Local , state , and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their records management systems . Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense category . The Group A offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories . Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system . In addition to the Group A offenses , eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information . The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary-based UCR system . As of 2004 , 5,271 law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data . That amount represents 20 % of the United States population and 16 % of the crime statistics data collected by the FBI .
However , the NSA 's report was completely disproved by Croatian experts . The report failed to recognize that Tito was a native speaker of the very distinctive local Kajkavian dialect of Zagorje . The acute accent , present only in Croatian dialects , which Tito is perfectly pronouncing , is the strongest proof of Tito 's belonging to Kajkavian dialect .
Chopin has figured extensively in Polish literature , both in serious critical studies of his life and music and in fictional treatments . The earliest manifestation was probably an 1830 sonnet on Chopin by Leon Ulrich . French writers on Chopin ( apart from Sand ) have included Marcel Proust and André Gide ; and he has also featured in works of Gottfried Benn and Boris Pasternak . There are numerous biographies of Chopin in English ( see bibliography for some of these ) .
The innovative production techniques devised by post-punk producers such as Martin Hannett and Dennis Bovell during this period would become an important element of the emerging music , with studio experimentation taking a central role . A variety of groups that predated punk , such as Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle , experimented with crude production techniques and electronic instruments in tandem with performance art methods and influence from transgressive literature , ultimately helping to pioneer industrial music . Throbbing Gristle 's independent label Industrial Records would become a hub for this scene and provide it with its namesake .
The most important state-owned companies headquartered in Montevideo are : AFE ( railways ) , ANCAP ( Energy ) , Administracion Nacional de Puertos ( Ports ) , ANTEL ( telecommunications ) , BHU ( savings and loan ) , BROU ( bank ) , BSE ( insurance ) , OSE ( water & sewage ) , UTE ( electricity ) . These companies operate under public law , using a legal entity defined in the Uruguayan Constitution called Ente Autonomo ( " autonomous entity " ) . The government also owns part of other companies operating under private law , such as those owned wholly or partially by the CND ( National Development Corporation ) .
Concerning humanity as the image of Christ , English Dominican spirituality concentrated on the moral implications of image-bearing rather than the philosophical foundations of the imago Dei . The process of Christ 's life , and the process of image-bearing , amends humanity to God 's image . The idea of the " image of God " demonstrates both the ability of man to move toward God ( as partakers in Christ 's redeeming sacrifice ) , and that , on some level , man is always an image of God . As their love and knowledge of God grows and is sanctified by faith and experience , the image of God within man becomes ever more bright and clear .
Both Allen and Lambert released the coronation song , " No Boundaries " which was co-written by DioGuardi . This is the first season in which the winner failed to achieve gold album status , and none from that season achieved platinum album status in the U.S. [ citation needed ]
West 's third studio album , Graduation , garnered major publicity when its release date pitted West in a sales competition against rapper 50 Cent 's Curtis . Upon their September 2007 releases , Graduation outsold Curtis by a large margin , debuting at number one on the U.S . Billboard 200 chart and selling 957,000 copies in its first week . Graduation once again continued the string of critical and commercial successes by West , and the album 's lead single , " Stronger " , garnered the rapper his third number-one hit . " Stronger " , which samples French house duo Daft Punk , has been accredited to not only encouraging other hip-hop artists to incorporate house and electronica elements into their music , but also for playing a part in the revival of disco and electro-infused music in the late 2000s . Ben Detrick of XXL cited the outcome of the sales competition between 50 Cent 's Curtis and West 's Graduation as being responsible for altering the direction of hip-hop and paving the way for new rappers who did n't follow the hardcore-gangster mold , writing , " If there was ever a watershed moment to indicate hip-hop 's changing direction , it may have come when 50 Cent competed with Kanye in 2007 to see whose album would claim superior sales . "
During adolescence , the human body undergoes various physical , physiological and immunological changes triggered and mediated by hormones , of which the most significant in females is 17-β-oestradiol ( an oestrogen ) and , in males , is testosterone . Oestradiol usually begins to act around the age of 10 and testosterone some months later . There is evidence that these steroids act directly not only on the primary and secondary sexual characteristics but also have an effect on the development and regulation of the immune system , including an increased risk in developing pubescent and post-pubescent autoimmunity . There is also some evidence that cell surface receptors on B cells and macrophages may detect sex hormones in the system .
In 1915 , as the Russian Caucasus Army continued to advance into eastern Anatolia , the Ottoman government started the deportation of its ethnic Armenian population , resulting in the death of approximately 1.5 million Armenians in what became known as the Armenian Genocide . The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases : the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour , followed by the deportation of women , children , the elderly and infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert . Driven forward by military escorts , the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery , rape , and systematic massacre . Large-scale massacres were also committed against the Empire 's Greek and Assyrian minorities as part of the same campaign of ethnic cleansing .
Towards the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s , producers such as Daft Punk , Stardust , Cassius , St. Germain and DJ Falcon began producing a new sound out of Paris 's house scene . Together , they laid the groundwork for what would be known as the French house movement . By combining the harder-edged-yet-soulful philosophy of Chicago house with the melodies of obscure funk , state-of-the-art production techniques and the sound of analog synthesizers , they began to create the standards that would shape all house music .
A recent addition to the exhibition is the late 13th-century Westminster Retable , England 's oldest altarpiece , which was most probably designed for the high altar of the abbey . Although it has been damaged in past centuries , the panel has been expertly cleaned and conserved .
Karl Marx published the Communist Manifesto in February 1848 , with little attention . However , a few days later the French Revolution of 1848 broke out , which replaced the monarchy of Louis Philippe with the Second French Republic . In June 1848 , Paris workers , disenchanted with the new government , built barricades and raised red flags . The new government called in the French Army to put down the uprising , the first of many such confrontations between the army and the new worker 's movements in Europe .
As the number and size of agricultural societies increased , they expanded into lands traditionally used by hunter-gatherers . This process of agriculture-driven expansion led to the development of the first forms of government in agricultural centers , such as the Fertile Crescent , Ancient India , Ancient China , Olmec , Sub-Saharan Africa and Norte Chico .
The list of nutrients that people are known to require is , in the words of Marion Nestle , " almost certainly incomplete " . As of 2014 , nutrients are thought to be of two types : macro-nutrients which are needed in relatively large amounts , and micronutrients which are needed in smaller quantities . A type of carbohydrate , dietary fiber , i.e . non-digestible material such as cellulose , is required , for both mechanical and biochemical reasons , although the exact reasons remain unclear . Other micronutrients include antioxidants and phytochemicals , which are said to influence ( or protect ) some body systems . Their necessity is not as well established as in the case of , for instance , vitamins .
Archaeologists excavating near the city have unearthed Iron Age sites that may date from 500 BCE . The region comprising modern Hyderabad and its surroundings was known as Golkonda ( Golla Konda- " shepherd 's hill " ) , and was ruled by the Chalukya dynasty from 624 CE to 1075 CE . Following the dissolution of the Chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century , Golkonda came under the control of the Kakatiya dynasty from 1158 , whose seat of power was at Warangal , 148 km ( 92 mi ) northeast of modern Hyderabad .
This contrasts with the presidential system , in which the president ( or equivalent ) is both the head of state and the head of the government . In some presidential or semi-presidential systems , such as those of France , Russia or South Korea , the prime minister is an official generally appointed by the president but usually approved by the legislature and responsible for carrying out the directives of the president and managing the civil service . The head of government of the People 's Republic of China is referred to as the Premier of the State Council and the premier of the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) is also appointed by the president , but requires no approval by the legislature .
Chopin 's relations with Sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter Solange and Solange 's fiancé , the young fortune-hunting sculptor Auguste Clésinger . The composer frequently took Solange 's side in quarrels with her mother ; he also faced jealousy from Sand 's son Maurice . Chopin was utterly indifferent to Sand 's radical political pursuits , while Sand looked on his society friends with disdain . As the composer 's illness progressed , Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin , whom she called her " third child " . In letters to third parties , she vented her impatience , referring to him as a " child , " a " little angel " , a " sufferer " and a " beloved little corpse . " In 1847 Sand published her novel Lucrezia Floriani , whose main characters—a rich actress and a prince in weak health—could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin ; the story was uncomplimentary to Chopin , who could not have missed the allusions as he helped Sand correct the printer 's galleys . In 1847 he did not visit Nohant , and he quietly ended their ten-year relationship following an angry correspondence which , in Sand 's words , made " a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship . " The two would never meet again .
The university employs 3,401 full-time faculty members across its eleven schools , including 18 members of the National Academy of Sciences , 65 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , 19 members of the National Academy of Engineering , and 6 members of the Institute of Medicine .

On 25 January 1952 , a confrontation between British forces and police at Ismailia resulted in the deaths of 40 Egyptian policemen , provoking riots in Cairo the next day which left 76 people dead . Afterwards , Nasser published a simple six-point program in Rose al-Yūsuf to dismantle feudalism and British influence in Egypt . In May , Nasser received word that Farouk knew the names of the Free Officers and intended to arrest them ; he immediately entrusted Free Officer Zakaria Mohieddin with the task of planning the government takeover by army units loyal to the association .
Following the events in Olympia , there were reports that China requested permission to deploy People 's Liberation Army personnel along the relay route to protect the flame in Canberra . Australian authorities stated that such a request , if it were to be made , would be refused . Chinese officials labeled it a rumor . Australian police have been given powers to search relay spectators , following a call by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association for Chinese Australian students to " go defend our sacred torch " against " ethnic degenerate scum and anti-China separatists " . Tony Goh , chairman of the Australian Council of Chinese Organisations , has said the ACCO would be taking " thousands " of pro-Beijing demonstrators to Canberra by bus , to support the torch relay . Zhang Rongan , a Chinese Australian student organising pro-Beijing demonstrations , told the press that Chinese diplomats were assisting with the organization of buses , meals and accommodation for pro-Beijing demonstrators , and helping them organise a " peaceful show of strength " . Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said Chinese officials were urging supporters to " turn up and put a point of view " , but that he had no objection to it as long as they remained peaceful .
Ganondorf then revives , and Midna teleports Link and Zelda outside the castle so she can hold him off with the Fused Shadows . However , as Hyrule Castle collapses , it is revealed that Ganondorf was victorious as he crushes Midna 's helmet . Ganondorf engages Link on horseback , and , assisted by Zelda and the Light Spirits , Link eventually knocks Ganondorf off his horse and they duel on foot before Link strikes down Ganondorf and plunges the Master Sword into his chest . With Ganondorf dead , the Light Spirits not only bring Midna back to life , but restore her to her true form . After bidding farewell to Link and Zelda , Midna returns home before destroying the Mirror of Twilight with a tear to maintain balance between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm . Near the end , as Hyrule Castle is rebuilt , Link is shown leaving Ordon Village heading to parts unknown .
Frustrated by the wasted effort , and with demands for action from their citizens , the allied force decided to attack the center of Russian strength in the Black Sea at Sevastopol on the Crimean peninsula . After extended preparations , the forces landed on the peninsula in September 1854 and fought their way to a point south of Sevastopol after a series of successful battles . The Russians counterattacked on 25 October in what became the Battle of Balaclava and were repulsed , but at the cost of seriously depleting the British Army forces . A second counterattack , ordered personally by Nicholas , was defeated by Omar Pasha . The front settled into a siege and led to horrible conditions for troops on both sides . Smaller actions were carried out in the Baltic , the Caucasus , the White Sea and in the North Pacific .
As noted in the introduction to this article , the American public has maintained its position of support for capital punishment for murder . However , when given a choice between the death penalty and life imprisonment without parole , support has traditionally been significantly lower than polling which has only mentioned the death penalty as a punishment . In 2010 , for instance , one poll showed 49 percent favoring the death penalty and 46 percent favoring life imprisonment while in another 61 % said they preferred another punishment to the death penalty . The highest level of support for the death penalty recorded overall was 80 percent in 1994 ( 16 percent opposed ) , and the lowest recorded was 42 percent in 1966 ( 47 percent opposed ) . On the question of the death penalty vs. life without parole , the strongest preference for the death penalty was 61 percent in 1997 ( 29 percent favoring life ) , and the lowest preference for the death penalty was 47 percent in 2006 ( 48 percent favoring life ) .
There are many notable contributors to the field of Chinese science throughout the ages . One of the best examples would be Shen Kuo ( 1031–1095 ) , a polymath scientist and statesman who was the first to describe the magnetic-needle compass used for navigation , discovered the concept of true north , improved the design of the astronomical gnomon , armillary sphere , sight tube , and clepsydra , and described the use of drydocks to repair boats . After observing the natural process of the inundation of silt and the find of marine fossils in the Taihang Mountains ( hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean ) , Shen Kuo devised a theory of land formation , or geomorphology . He also adopted a theory of gradual climate change in regions over time , after observing petrified bamboo found underground at Yan'an , Shaanxi province . If not for Shen Kuo 's writing , the architectural works of Yu Hao would be little known , along with the inventor of movable type printing , Bi Sheng ( 990-1051 ) . Shen 's contemporary Su Song ( 1020–1101 ) was also a brilliant polymath , an astronomer who created a celestial atlas of star maps , wrote a pharmaceutical treatise with related subjects of botany , zoology , mineralogy , and metallurgy , and had erected a large astronomical clocktower in Kaifeng city in 1088 . To operate the crowning armillary sphere , his clocktower featured an escapement mechanism and the world 's oldest known use of an endless power-transmitting chain drive .
Much of the Great Plains became open range , or rangeland where cattle roamed free , hosting ranching operations where anyone was theoretically free to run cattle . In the spring and fall , ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves , treated animals and sorted the cattle for sale . Such ranching began in Texas and gradually moved northward . In 1866-95 , cowboys herded 10 million cattle north to rail heads such as Dodge City , Kansas and Ogallala , Nebraska ; from there , cattle were shipped eastward .
With 120,000 students in London , the federal University of London is the largest contact teaching university in the UK . It includes four large multi-faculty universities – King 's College London , Queen Mary , Royal Holloway and UCL – and a number of smaller and more specialised institutions including Birkbeck , the Courtauld Institute of Art , Goldsmiths , Guildhall School of Music and Drama , the Institute of Education , the London Business School , the London School of Economics , the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine , the Royal Academy of Music , the Central School of Speech and Drama , the Royal Veterinary College and the School of Oriental and African Studies . Members of the University of London have their own admissions procedures , and some award their own degrees .
The maximum energy is a function of dielectric volume , permittivity , and dielectric strength . Changing the plate area and the separation between the plates while maintaining the same volume causes no change of the maximum amount of energy that the capacitor can store , so long as the distance between plates remains much smaller than both the length and width of the plates . In addition , these equations assume that the electric field is entirely concentrated in the dielectric between the plates . In reality there are fringing fields outside the dielectric , for example between the sides of the capacitor plates , which will increase the effective capacitance of the capacitor . This is sometimes called parasitic capacitance . For some simple capacitor geometries this additional capacitance term can be calculated analytically . It becomes negligibly small when the ratios of plate width to separation and length to separation are large .
Primary resistance occurs when a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB . A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary ( acquired ) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment , not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately ( lack of compliance ) , or using low-quality medication . Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries , as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs . MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs : rifampicin and isoniazid . Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs . Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs . It was first observed in 2003 in Italy , but not widely reported until 2012 , and has also been found in Iran and India . Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB .
These different explorations of 'identity ' demonstrate how difficult a concept it is to pin down . Since identity is a virtual thing , it is impossible to define it empirically . Discussions of identity use the term with different meanings , from fundamental and abiding sameness , to fluidity , contingency , negotiated and so on . Brubaker and Cooper note a tendency in many scholars to confuse identity as a category of practice and as a category of analysis ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 5 ) . Indeed , many scholars demonstrate a tendency to follow their own preconceptions of identity , following more or less the frameworks listed above , rather than taking into account the mechanisms by which the concept is crystallised as reality . In this environment , some analysts , such as Brubaker and Cooper , have suggested doing away with the concept completely ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 1 ) . Others , by contrast , have sought to introduce alternative concepts in an attempt to capture the dynamic and fluid qualities of human social self-expression . Hall ( 1992 , 1996 ) , for example , suggests treating identity as a process , to take into account the reality of diverse and ever-changing social experience . Some scholars have introduced the idea of identification , whereby identity is perceived as made up of different components that are 'identified ' and interpreted by individuals . The construction of an individual sense of self is achieved by personal choices regarding who and what to associate with . Such approaches are liberating in their recognition of the role of the individual in social interaction and the construction of identity .
The rebel barons responded by inviting the French prince Louis to lead them : Louis had a claim to the English throne by virtue of his marriage to Blanche of Castile , a granddaughter of Henry II . Philip may have provided him with private support but refused to openly support Louis , who was excommunicated by Innocent for taking part in the war against John . Louis ' planned arrival in England presented a significant problem for John , as the prince would bring with him naval vessels and siege engines essential to the rebel cause . Once John contained Alexander in Scotland , he marched south to deal with the challenge of the coming invasion .
During the rule of the succeeding Hanoverian dynasty , power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government . The first Hanoverian monarch , George I , relied on his ministers to a greater extent than did previous monarchs . Later Hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation : George III and George IV both openly opposed Catholic Emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a Catholic emancipation bill would violate the Coronation Oath , which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established Church of England from Papal domination and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy . However , George IV reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers . Thus , as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved , the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse , both in the United Kingdom and in the other Commonwealth realms .
Agriculture and horticulture seek to optimize the capture of solar energy in order to optimize the productivity of plants . Techniques such as timed planting cycles , tailored row orientation , staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields . While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource , the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture . During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age , French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy . These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm . Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south , but over time , sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight . In 1699 , Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun . Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water , drying crops , brooding chicks and drying chicken manure . More recently the technology has been embraced by vinters , who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses .
Barça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey Final , winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time . A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became La Liga champions for the 2008–09 season . Barça finished the season by beating the previous year 's Champions League winners Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome to win their third Champions League title and completed the first ever treble won by a Spanish team . The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk , becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble . In December 2009 , Barcelona won the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup , and became the first football club ever to accomplish the sextuple . Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Spanish Super Cup trophy for a ninth time .
Over 50 % of undergraduate students live on campus . Most of the residence halls on campus are located on the South 40 , named because of its adjacent location on the south side of the Danforth Campus and its size of 40 acres ( 160,000 m2 ) . It is the location of all the freshman buildings as well as several upperclassman buildings , which are set up in the traditional residential college system . All of the residential halls are co-ed . The South 40 is organized as a pedestrian-friendly environment wherein residences surround a central recreational lawn known as the Swamp . Bear 's Den ( the largest dining hall on campus ) , the Habif Health and Wellness Center ( Student Health Services ) , the Residential Life Office , University Police Headquarters , various student-owned businesses ( e.g . the laundry service , Wash U Wash ) , and the baseball , softball , and intramural fields are also located on the South 40 .
Because of the low elevation , the islands that make up this nation are vulnerable to the effects of tropical cyclones and by the threat of current and future sea level rise . The highest elevation is 4.6 metres ( 15 ft ) above sea level on Niulakita , which gives Tuvalu the second-lowest maximum elevation of any country ( after the Maldives ) . The highest elevations are typically in narrow storm dunes on the ocean side of the islands which are prone to overtopping in tropical cyclones , as occurred with Cyclone Bebe , which was a very early-season storm that passed through the Tuvaluan atolls in October 1972 . Cyclone Bebe submerged Funafuti , eliminating 90 % of structures on the island . Sources of drinking water were contaminated as a result of the system 's storm surge and the flooding of the sources of fresh water .
It is the third language of South Africa in terms of native speakers ( ~13.5 % ) , of whom 53 percent are Coloureds and 42.4 percent Whites . In 1996 , 40 percent of South Africans reported to know Afrikaans at least at a very basic level of communication . It is the lingua franca in Namibia , where it is spoken natively in 11 percent of households . In total , Afrikaans is the first language in South Africa alone of about 6.8 million people and is estimated to be a second language for at least 10 million people worldwide , compared to over 23 million and 5 million respectively , for Dutch .
Von Neumann was born Neumann János Lajos ( in Hungarian the family name comes first ) , Hebrew name Yonah , in Budapest , Kingdom of Hungary , which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , to wealthy Jewish parents of the Haskalah . He was the eldest of three children . He had two younger brothers : Michael , born in 1907 , and Nicholas , who was born in 1911 . His father , Neumann Miksa ( Max Neumann ) was a banker , who held a doctorate in law . He had moved to Budapest from Pécs at the end of the 1880s . Miksa 's father and grandfather were both born in Ond ( now part of the town of Szerencs ) , Zemplén County , northern Hungary . John 's mother was Kann Margit ( Margaret Kann ) ; her parents were Jakab Kann and Katalin Meisels . Three generations of the Kann family lived in spacious apartments above the Kann-Heller offices in Budapest ; von Neumann 's family occupied an 18-room apartment on the top floor .
Walking is a popular recreational activity in London . Areas that provide for walks include Wimbledon Common , Epping Forest , Hampton Court Park , Hampstead Heath , the eight Royal Parks , canals and disused railway tracks . Access to canals and rivers has improved recently , including the creation of the Thames Path , some 28 miles ( 45 km ) of which is within Greater London , and The Wandle Trail ; this runs 12 miles ( 19 km ) through South London along the River Wandle , a tributary of the River Thames . Other long distance paths , linking green spaces , have also been created , including the Capital Ring , the Green Chain Walk , London Outer Orbital Path ( " Loop " ) , Jubilee Walkway , Lea Valley Walk , and the Diana , Princess of Wales Memorial Walk .
Boston ( pronounced i/ˈbɒstən/ ) is the capital and largest city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States . Boston also served as the historic county seat of Suffolk County until Massachusetts disbanded county government in 1999 . The city proper covers 48 square miles ( 124 km2 ) with an estimated population of 655,884 in 2014 , making it the largest city in New England and the 24th largest city in the United States . The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area called Greater Boston , home to 4.7 million people and the tenth-largest metropolitan statistical area in the country . Greater Boston as a commuting region is home to 8.1 million people , making it the sixth-largest combined statistical area in the United States .
Victoria 's youngest son , Leopold , was affected by the blood-clotting disease haemophilia B and two of her five daughters , Alice and Beatrice , were carriers . Royal haemophiliacs descended from Victoria included her great-grandsons , Tsarevich Alexei of Russia , Alfonso , Prince of Asturias , and Infante Gonzalo of Spain . The presence of the disease in Victoria 's descendants , but not in her ancestors , led to modern speculation that her true father was not the Duke of Kent but a haemophiliac . There is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with Victoria 's mother , and as male carriers always suffer the disease , even if such a man had existed he would have been seriously ill . It is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because Victoria 's father was over 50 at the time of her conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers . Spontaneous mutations account for about a third of cases .
The elaboration of the cerebral cortex carries with it changes to other brain areas . The superior colliculus , which plays a major role in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates , shrinks to a small size in mammals , and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex . The cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion ( the neocerebellum ) dedicated to supporting the cerebral cortex , which has no counterpart in other vertebrates .
An individual wrestler may sometimes use their real name , or a minor variation of it , for much of their career , such as Angelo Poffo , Ernie Ladd , Verne Gagne , Bret Hart , and Randy Orton . Others can keep one ring name for their entire career ( cases in point include Chris Jericho , Shawn Michaels , CM Punk and Ricky Steamboat ) , or may change from time to time to better suit the demands of the audience or company . Sometimes a character is owned and trademarked by the company , forcing the wrestler to find a new one when they leave ( although a simple typeset change , such as changing Rhyno to Rhino , can usually get around this ) , and sometimes a character is owned by the wrestler . Sometimes , a wrestler may change their legal name in order to obtain ownership of their ring name ( examples include Andrew Martin and Warrior ) . Many wrestlers ( such as The Rock and The Undertaker ) are strongly identified with their character , even responding to the name in public or between friends . It 's actually considered proper decorum for fellow wrestlers to refer to each other by their stage names/characters rather than their birth/legal names , unless otherwise introduced . A professional wrestling character 's popularity can grow to the point that it makes appearances in other media ( see Hulk Hogan and El Santo ) or even give the performer enough visibility to enter politics ( Antonio Inoki and Jesse Ventura , among others ) .
Although it had equipment capable of doing serious damage , the problem for the Luftwaffe was its unclear strategy and poor intelligence . OKL had not been informed that Britain was to be considered a potential opponent until early 1938 . It had no time to gather reliable intelligence on Britain 's industries . Moreover , OKL could not settle on an appropriate strategy . German planners had to decide whether the Luftwaffe should deliver the weight of its attacks against a specific segment of British industry such as aircraft factories , or against a system of interrelated industries such as Britain 's import and distribution network , or even in a blow aimed at breaking the morale of the British population . The Luftwaffe 's strategy became increasingly aimless over the winter of 1940–1941 . Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy . This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it began .
By synchronously resetting all clocks in a region to one hour ahead of Standard Time ( one hour " fast " ) , individuals who follow such a year-round schedule will wake an hour earlier than they would have otherwise ; they will begin and complete daily work routines an hour earlier , and they will have available to them an extra hour of daylight after their workday activities . However , they will have one less hour of daylight at the start of each day , making the policy less practical during winter .
Materialism is a form of philosophical monism which holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature , and that all phenomena , including mental phenomena and consciousness , are identical with material interactions .
The language of the Quran has been described as " rhymed prose " as it partakes of both poetry and prose ; however , this description runs the risk of failing to convey the rhythmic quality of Quranic language , which is more poetic in some parts and more prose-like in others . Rhyme , while found throughout the Quran , is conspicuous in many of the earlier Meccan suras , in which relatively short verses throw the rhyming words into prominence . The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81 , and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers . Frequently a change of rhyme from one set of verses to another signals a change in the subject of discussion . Later sections also preserve this form but the style is more expository .
The music hall and cabaret are famous Paris institutions . The Moulin Rouge was opened in 1889 . It was highly visible because of its large red imitation windmill on its roof , and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan . It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec , who made posters for the venue . In 1911 , the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows , competing with its great rival , the Folies Bergère , Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker . The Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers , including Mistinguett , Maurice Chevalier , and Tino Rossi . Other famous Paris music halls include Le Lido , on the Champs-Élysées , opened in 1946 ; and the Crazy Horse Saloon , featuring strip-tease , dance and magic , opened in 1951 . The Olympia Paris has presented Edith Piaf , Marlene Dietrich , Miles Davis , Judy Garland , and the Grateful Dead . A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris , attended mostly visitors to the city .
Although the city lost the status of state capital to Columbia in 1786 , Charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-Revolutionary years . The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop , making short-staple cotton profitable . It was more easily grown in the upland areas , and cotton quickly became South Carolina 's major export commodity . The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations , to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted . Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city , working as domestics , artisans , market workers , and laborers .
Archaeological discovery shows that " Nanjing Man " lived in more than 500 thousand years ago . Zun , a kind of wine vessel , was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago . In the late period of Shang dynasty , Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state , and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture . According to legend , [ which ? ] Fuchai , King of the State of Wu , founded a fort named Yecheng ( 冶城 ) in today 's Nanjing area in 495 BC . Later in 473 BC , the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng ( 越城 ) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate . In 333 BC , after eliminating the State of Yue , the State of Chu built Jinling Yi ( 金陵邑 ) in the western part of present-day Nanjing . It was renamed Moling ( 秣陵 ) during reign of Qin Shi Huang . Since then , the city experienced destruction and renewal many times . [ citation needed ] The area was successively part of Kuaiji , Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty , and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation 's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty ( 106 BC ) . Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture , and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang .
Species that have no long-distance migratory relatives , such as the waxwings Bombycilla , are effectively moving in response to winter weather and the loss of their usual winter food , rather than enhanced breeding opportunities .
Machine vision systems often require bright and homogeneous illumination , so features of interest are easier to process . LEDs are often used for this purpose , and this is likely to remain one of their major uses until the price drops low enough to make signaling and illumination uses more widespread . Barcode scanners are the most common example of machine vision , and many low cost products use red LEDs instead of lasers . Optical computer mice are an example of LEDs in machine vision , as it is used to provide an even light source on the surface for the miniature camera within the mouse . LEDs constitute a nearly ideal light source for machine vision systems for several reasons :
The experience of pain has many cultural dimensions . For instance , the way in which one experiences and responds to pain is related to sociocultural characteristics , such as gender , ethnicity , and age . An aging adult may not respond to pain in the way that a younger person would . Their ability to recognize pain may be blunted by illness or the use of multiple prescription drugs . Depression may also keep the older adult from reporting they are in pain . The older adult may also quit doing activities they love because it hurts too much . Decline in self-care activities ( dressing , grooming , walking , etc . ) may also be indicators that the older adult is experiencing pain . The older adult may refrain from reporting pain because they are afraid they will have to have surgery or will be put on a drug they might become addicted to . They may not want others to see them as weak , or may feel there is something impolite or shameful in complaining about pain , or they may feel the pain is deserved punishment for past transgressions .
An example of this theory in action would be as follows : An emotion-evoking stimulus ( snake ) triggers a pattern of physiological response ( increased heart rate , faster breathing , etc . ) , which is interpreted as a particular emotion ( fear ) . This theory is supported by experiments in which by manipulating the bodily state induces a desired emotional state . Some people may believe that emotions give rise to emotion-specific actions : e.g . " I 'm crying because I 'm sad , " or " I ran away because I was scared . " The issue with the James–Lange theory is that of causation ( bodily states causing emotions and being a priori ) , not that of the bodily influences on emotional experience ( which can be argued and is still quite prevalent today in biofeedback studies and embodiment theory ) .
From its base in India , the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s . This trade , illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729 , helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea , which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China . In 1839 , the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War , and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island , at that time a minor settlement .
More than 12,000 miles ( 19,000 km ) of roads make up the state 's major highway skeleton , including state-operated highways , ten turnpikes or major toll roads , and the longest drivable stretch of Route 66 in the nation . In 2008 , Interstate 44 in Oklahoma City was Oklahoma 's busiest highway , with a daily traffic volume of 123,300 cars . In 2010 , the state had the nation 's third highest number of bridges classified as structurally deficient , with nearly 5,212 bridges in disrepair , including 235 National Highway System Bridges .
Anxious to expand the company 's broadcast and cable presence , longtime MCA head Lew Wasserman sought a rich partner . He located Japanese electronics manufacturer Matsushita Electric ( now known as Panasonic ) , which agreed to acquire MCA for $ 6.6 billion in 1990 . Meanwhile , around this time , the production subsidiary was renamed Universal Studios Inc. , and ( in 1990 ) MCA created MCA/Universal Home Video Inc. for the VHS video cassette ( later DVD ) sales industry .
The structure known as " Virgil 's tomb " is found at the entrance of an ancient Roman tunnel ( also known as " grotta vecchia " ) in Piedigrotta , a district two miles from the centre of Naples , near the Mergellina harbor , on the road heading north along the coast to Pozzuoli . While Virgil was already the object of literary admiration and veneration before his death , in the Middle Ages his name became associated with miraculous powers , and for a couple of centuries his tomb was the destination of pilgrimages and veneration .
West , alongside his mother , founded the " Kanye West Foundation " in Chicago in 2003 , tasked with a mission to battle dropout and illiteracy rates , while partnering with community organizations to provide underprivileged youth access to music education . In 2007 , the West and the Foundation partnered with Strong American Schools as part of their " Ed in '08 " campaign . As spokesman for the campaign , West appeared in a series of PSAs for the organization , and hosted an inaugural benefit concert in August of that year .
Quoted at constant 2002 prices , GDP fell from £12 million in 1999-2000 to £11 million in 2005-06 . Imports are mainly from the UK and South Africa and amounted to £6.4 million in 2004-05 ( quoted on an FOB basis ) . Exports are much smaller , amounting to £0.2 million in 2004-05 . Exports are mainly fish and coffee ; Philatelic sales were £0.06 million in 2004-05 . The limited number of visiting tourists spent about £0.4 million in 2004-05 , representing a contribution to GDP of 3 % .
The name Thuringia or Thüringen derives from the Germanic tribe Thuringii , who emerged during the Migration Period . Their origin is not completely known . An older theory claimed that they were successors of the Hermunduri , but later research rejected the idea . Other historians argue that the Thuringians were allies of the Huns , came to central Europe together with them , and lived before in what is Galicia today . Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus first mentioned the Thuringii around 400 ; during that period , the Thuringii were famous for their excellent horses .
Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter ( /biːˈjɒnseɪ/ bee-YON-say ) ( born September 4 , 1981 ) is an American singer , songwriter , record producer and actress . Born and raised in Houston , Texas , she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child , and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R & B girl-group Destiny 's Child . Managed by her father , Mathew Knowles , the group became one of the world 's best-selling girl groups of all time . Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé 's debut album , Dangerously in Love ( 2003 ) , which established her as a solo artist worldwide , earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles " Crazy in Love " and " Baby Boy " .
This changed with the recent sovereign-debt crisis . The ECB always could , and through the late summer of 2011 did , purchase bonds issued by the weaker states even though it assumes , in doing so , the risk of a deteriorating balance sheet . ECB buying focused primarily on Spanish and Italian debt . Certain techniques can minimise the impact . Purchases of Italian bonds by the central bank , for example , were intended to dampen international speculation and strengthen portfolios in the private sector and also the central bank .
Beyoncé and husband Jay Z are friends with President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama . She performed " America the Beautiful " at the 2009 presidential inauguration , as well as " At Last " during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later . Beyoncé and Jay Z held a fundraiser at the latter 's 40/40 Club in Manhattan for Obama 's 2012 presidential campaign which raised $ 4 million . Beyoncé uploaded pictures of her paper ballot on Tumblr , confirming she had voted in support for the Democratic Party and to encourage others to do so . She also performed the American national anthem at his second inauguration , singing along with a pre-recorded track . She publicly endorsed same sex marriage on March 26 , 2013 , after the Supreme Court debate on California 's Proposition 8 . In July 2013 , Beyoncé and Jay-Z attended a rally in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting of Trayvon Martin .
Chopin 's tombstone , featuring the muse of music , Euterpe , weeping over a broken lyre , was designed and sculpted by Clésinger . The expenses of the funeral and monument , amounting to 5,000 francs , were covered by Jane Stirling , who also paid for the return of the composer 's sister Ludwika to Warsaw . Ludwika took Chopin 's heart in an urn , preserved in alcohol , back to Poland in 1850 . [ n 9 ] She also took a collection of two hundred letters from Sand to Chopin ; after 1851 these were returned to Sand , who seems to have destroyed them .
On July 1 , 1988 , the fourth and last day of a bruising 19th Party Conference , Gorbachev won the backing of the tired delegates for his last-minute proposal to create a new supreme legislative body called the Congress of People 's Deputies . Frustrated by the old guard 's resistance , Gorbachev embarked on a set of constitutional changes to try to separate party and state , and thereby isolate his conservative Party opponents . Detailed proposals for the new Congress of People 's Deputies were published on October 2 , 1988 , and to enable the creation of the new legislature the Supreme Soviet , during its November 29–December 1 , 1988 , session , implemented amendments to the 1977 Soviet Constitution , enacted a law on electoral reform , and set the date of the election for March 26 , 1989 .
From the 2011 Census , the Office for National Statistics published that Plymouth 's unitary authority area population was 256,384 ; 15,664 more people than that of the last census from 2001 , which indicated that Plymouth had a population of 240,720 . The Plymouth urban area had a population of 260,203 in 2011 ( the urban sprawl which extends outside the authority 's boundaries ) . The city 's average household size was 2.3 persons . At the time of the 2011 UK census , the ethnic composition of Plymouth 's population was 96.2 % White ( of 92.9 % was White British ) , with the largest minority ethnic group being Chinese at 0.5 % . The white Irish ethnic group saw the largest decline in its share of the population since the 2001 Census ( -24 % ) , while the Other Asian and Black African had the largest increases ( 360 % and 351 % respectively ) . This excludes the two new ethnic groups added to the 2011 census of Gypsy or Irish Traveller and Arab . The population rose rapidly during the second half of the 19th century , but declined by over 1.6 % from 1931 to 1951 .
Traditionally the Rajputs , Jats , Meenas , Gurjars , Bhils , Rajpurohit , Charans , Yadavs , Bishnois , Sermals , PhulMali ( Saini ) and other tribes made a great contribution in building the state of Rajasthan . All these tribes suffered great difficulties in protecting their culture and the land . Millions of them were killed trying to protect their land . A number of Gurjars had been exterminated in Bhinmal and Ajmer areas fighting with the invaders . Bhils once ruled Kota . Meenas were rulers of Bundi and the Dhundhar region .
In China , a call to boycott French hypermart Carrefour from May 1 began spreading through mobile text messaging and online chat rooms amongst the Chinese over the weekend from April 12 , accusing the company 's major shareholder , the LVMH Group , of donating funds to the Dalai Lama . There were also calls to extend the boycott to include French luxury goods and cosmetic products . Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming , Hefei and Wuhan , accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism . Some burned French flags , some added Swastika ( due to its conotaions with Nazism ) to the French flag , and spread short online messages calling for large protests in front of French consulates and embassy . Some shoppers who insisted on entering one of the Carrefour stores in Kunming were blocked by boycotters wielding large Chinese flags and hit by water bottles . Hundreds of people joined Anti-French rallies in Beijing , Wuhan , Hefei , Kunming and Qingdao , which quickly spread to other cities like Xi'an , Harbin and Jinan . Carrefour denied any support or involvement in the Tibetan issue , and had its staff in its Chinese stores wear uniforms emblazoned with the Chinese national flag and caps with Olympic insignia and as well as the words " Beijing 2008 " to show its support for the games . The effort had to be ceased when the BOCOG deemed the use of official Olympic insignia as illegal and a violation of copyright .
The British recognised the need for anti-aircraft capability a few weeks before World War I broke out ; on 8 July 1914 , the New York Times reported that the British government had decided to 'dot the coasts of the British Isles with a series of towers , each armed with two quick-firing guns of special design , ' while 'a complete circle of towers ' was to be built around 'naval installations ' and 'at other especially vulnerable points . ' By December 1914 the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve ( RNVR ) was manning AA guns and searchlights assembled from various sources at some nine ports . The Royal Garrison Artillery ( RGA ) was given responsibility for AA defence in the field , using motorised two-gun sections . The first were formally formed in November 1914 . Initially they used QF 1-pounder " pom-pom " ( a 37 mm version of the Maxim Gun ) .
Michel Djotodia took over as president and in May 2013 Central African Republic 's Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye requested a UN peacekeeping force from the UN Security Council and on 31 May former President Bozizé was indicted for crimes against humanity and incitement of genocide . The security situation did not improve during June–August 2013 and there were reports of over 200,000 internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) as well as human rights abuses and renewed fighting between Séléka and Bozizé supporters .
It was announced on December 12 , 2012 , that the AFL reached a partnership agreement with NET10 Wireless to be the first non-motorsports-related professional sports league in the United States to have a title sponsor , renaming it the NET10 Wireless Arena Football League . The redesigned website showed the new logo which incorporated the current AFL logo with the one from NET10 Wireless . The title sponsorship agreement ended in 2014 after a two-year partnership .
The Swazi economy is very closely linked to the economy of South Africa , from which it receives over 90 % of its imports and to which it sends about 70 % of its exports . Swaziland 's other key trading partners are the United States and the EU , from whom the country has received trade preferences for apparel exports ( under the African Growth and Opportunity Act – AGOA – to the US ) and for sugar ( to the EU ) . Under these agreements , both apparel and sugar exports did well , with rapid growth and a strong inflow of foreign direct investment . Textile exports grew by over 200 % between 2000 and 2005 and sugar exports increasing by more than 50 % over the same period .
In its metaphysics , Nyāya school is closer to the Vaiśeṣika school than others . It holds that human suffering results from mistakes/defects produced by activity under wrong knowledge ( notions and ignorance ) . Moksha ( liberation ) , it states , is gained through right knowledge . This premise led Nyāya to concern itself with epistemology , that is the reliable means to gain correct knowledge and to remove wrong notions . False knowledge is not merely ignorance to Naiyayikas , it includes delusion . Correct knowledge is discovering and overcoming one 's delusions , and understanding true nature of soul , self and reality . The Nyāya Sūtras begin :
Coordination strategies differ when adjacent time zones shift clocks . The European Union shifts all at once , at 01:00 UTC or 02:00 CET or 03:00 EET ; for example , Eastern European Time is always one hour ahead of Central European Time . Most of North America shifts at 02:00 local time , so its zones do not shift at the same time ; for example , Mountain Time is temporarily ( for one hour ) zero hours ahead of Pacific Time , instead of one hour ahead , in the autumn and two hours , instead of one , ahead of Pacific Time in the spring . In the past , Australian districts went even further and did not always agree on start and end dates ; for example , in 2008 most DST-observing areas shifted clocks forward on October 5 but Western Australia shifted on October 26 . In some cases only part of a country shifts ; for example , in the US , Hawaii and most of Arizona do not observe DST .
In 712 , Arab Muslim general Muhammad bin Qasim conquered most of the Indus region in modern-day Pakistan for the Umayyad Empire , incorporating it as the " As-Sindh " province with its capital at Al-Mansurah , 72 km ( 45 mi ) north of modern Hyderabad in Sindh , Pakistan . After several incursions , the Hindu kings east of Indus defeated the Arabs at the Battle of Rajasthan , halting their expansion and containing them at Sindh in Pakistan . The south Indian Chalukya empire under Vikramaditya II , Nagabhata I of the Pratihara dynasty and Bappa Rawal of the Guhilot dynasty repulsed the Arab invaders in the early 8th century .
Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game . The game is played using a spherical ball of 68.5–69.5 cm ( 27.0–27.4 in ) circumference , known as the football ( or soccer ball ) . Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team 's goal ( between the posts and under the bar ) , thereby scoring a goal . The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner ; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw . Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game : to be involved in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks .
The establishment of the Santa Hermandad in 1480 , and of the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia in 1500—a tribunal and executive body directed by the Governor-Captain General as a direct representative of the King—implied initially the submission of the Kingdom to the Crown , after a century of unrest and fiscal insubordination . As a result , from 1480 to 1520 the Kingdom of Galicia contributed more than 10 % of the total earnings of the Crown of Castille , including the Americas , well over its economic relevance . Like the rest of Spain , the 16th century was marked by population growth up to 1580 , when the simultaneous wars with the Netherlands , France and England hampered Galicia 's Atlantic commerce , which consisted mostly in the exportation of sardines , wood , and some cattle and wine .
The " General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples " grants all indigenous languages spoken in Mexico , regardless of the number of speakers , the same validity as Spanish in all territories in which they are spoken , and indigenous peoples are entitled to request some public services and documents in their native languages . Along with Spanish , the law has granted them — more than 60 languages — the status of " national languages " . The law includes all indigenous languages of the Americas regardless of origin ; that is , it includes the indigenous languages of ethnic groups non-native to the territory . As such the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples recognizes the language of the Kickapoo , who immigrated from the United States , and recognizes the languages of the Guatemalan indigenous refugees . The Mexican government has promoted and established bilingual primary and secondary education in some indigenous rural communities . Nonetheless , of the indigenous peoples in Mexico , only about 67 % of them ( or 5.4 % of the country 's population ) speak an indigenous language and about a sixth do not speak Spanish ( 1.2 % of the country 's population ) .
Swiss are fans of football and the national team is nicknamed the 'Nati ' . The headquarters of the sport 's governing body , the International Federation of Association Football ( FIFA ) , is located in Zürich . Switzerland hosted the 1954 FIFA World Cup , and was the joint host , with Austria , of the Euro 2008 tournament . The Swiss Super League is the nation 's professional club league . For the Brasil 2014 World Cup finals tournament , the country 's German-speaking cantons will be closely monitored by local police forces to prevent celebrations beyond one hour after matches end . Europe 's highest football pitch , at 2,000 metres ( 6,600 ft ) above sea level , is located in Switzerland and is named the Ottmar Hitzfeld Stadium .
At the end of the 15th century the Ottoman Empire advanced all over Southeastern Europe , eventually conquering the Byzantine Empire and extending control over the Balkan states . Hungary was the last bastion of the Latin Christian world in the East , and fought to keep its rule over a period of two centuries . After the tragic death of the young king Vladislaus I of Hungary during the Battle of Varna in 1444 against the Ottomans , the Kingdom was placed in the hands of count John Hunyadi , who became Hungary 's regent-governor ( 1446–1453 ) . Hunyadi was considered one of the most relevant military figures of the 15th century : Pope Pius II awarded him the title of Athleta Christi or Champion of Christ for being the only hope of resisting the Ottomans from advancing to Central and Western Europe .
The Aeneid is widely considered Virgil 's finest work and one of the most important poems in the history of western literature . Virgil worked on the Aeneid during the last eleven years of his life ( 29–19 BC ) , commissioned , according to Propertius , by Augustus . The epic poem consists of 12 books in dactylic hexameter verse which describe the journey of Aeneas , a warrior fleeing the sack of Troy , to Italy , his battle with the Italian prince Turnus , and the foundation of a city from which Rome would emerge . The Aeneid 's first six books describe the journey of Aeneas from Troy to Rome . Virgil made use of several models in the composition of his epic ; Homer , the preeminent author of classical epic , is everywhere present , but Virgil also makes special use of the Latin poet Ennius and the Hellenistic poet Apollonius of Rhodes among the various other writers to which he alludes . Although the Aeneid casts itself firmly into the epic mode , it often seeks to expand the genre by including elements of other genres such as tragedy and aetiological poetry . Ancient commentators noted that Virgil seems to divide the Aeneid into two sections based on the poetry of Homer ; the first six books were viewed as employing the Odyssey as a model while the last six were connected to the Iliad .
Traditionally , Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona 's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority , in stark contrast to Barça 's revolutionary spirit . Also in the 1960s and 1970s , while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia 's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life , Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen , military officers , civil servants and career fascists .
To prevent further loss of groundwater , Tucson has been involved in water conservation and groundwater preservation efforts , shifting away from its reliance on a series of Tucson area wells in favor of conservation , consumption-based pricing for residential and commercial water use , and new wells in the more sustainable Avra Valley aquifer , northwest of the city . An allocation from the Central Arizona Project Aqueduct ( CAP ) , which passes more than 300 mi ( 480 km ) across the desert from the Colorado River , has been incorporated into the city 's water supply , annually providing over 20 million gallons of " recharged " water which is pumped into the ground to replenish water pumped out . Since 2001 , CAP water has allowed the city to remove or turn off over 80 wells .
The name Shell is linked to The " Shell " Transport and Trading Company . In 1833 , the founder 's father , Marcus Samuel , founded an import business to sell seashells to London collectors . When collecting seashell specimens in the Caspian Sea area in 1892 , the younger Samuel realised there was potential in exporting lamp oil from the region and commissioned the world 's first purpose-built oil tanker , the Murex ( Latin for a type of snail shell ) , to enter this market ; by 1907 the company had a fleet . Although for several decades the company had a refinery at Shell Haven on the Thames , there is no evidence of this having provided the name .
Detroit has four border crossings : the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel provide motor vehicle thoroughfares , with the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel providing railroad access to and from Canada . The fourth border crossing is the Detroit–Windsor Truck Ferry , located near the Windsor Salt Mine and Zug Island . Near Zug Island , the southwest part of the city was developed over a 1,500-acre ( 610 ha ) salt mine that is 1,100 feet ( 340 m ) below the surface . The Detroit Salt Company mine has over 100 miles ( 160 km ) of roads within .
The name Thuringia or Thüringen derives from the Germanic tribe Thuringii , who emerged during the Migration Period . Their origin is not completely known . An older theory claimed that they were successors of the Hermunduri , but later research rejected the idea . Other historians argue that the Thuringians were allies of the Huns , came to central Europe together with them , and lived before in what is Galicia today . Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus first mentioned the Thuringii around 400 ; during that period , the Thuringii were famous for their excellent horses .
During the Hellenistic period , many different schools of thought developed . Athens , with its multiple philosophical schools , continued to remain the center of philosophical thought . However Athens had now lost her political freedom and Hellenistic philosophy is a reflection of this new difficult period . In this political climate , Hellenistic philosophers went in search of goals such as ataraxia ( un-disturbedness ) , autarky ( self-sufficiency ) and apatheia ( freedom from suffering ) , which would allow them to wrest well-being or eudaimonia out of the most difficult turns of fortune . This occupation with the inner life , with personal inner liberty and with the pursuit of eudaimonia is what all Hellenistic philosophical schools have in common .
The LSPU Hall is home to the Resource Centre for the Arts . The " Hall " hosts a vibrant and diverse arts community and is regarded as the backbone of artistic infrastructure and development in the downtown . The careers of many well-known Newfoundland artists were launched there including Rick Mercer , Mary Walsh , Cathy Jones , Andy Jones and Greg Thomey . The St. John 's Arts and Culture Centre houses an art gallery , libraries and a 1000-seat theatre , which is the city 's major venue for entertainment productions .
Prior to the 2011–2012 season , Barcelona had a long history of avoiding corporate sponsorship on the playing shirts . On 14 July 2006 , the club announced a five-year agreement with UNICEF , which includes having the UNICEF logo on their shirts . The agreement had the club donate €1.5 million per year to UNICEF ( 0.7 percent of its ordinary income , equal to the UN International Aid Target , cf . ODA ) via the FC Barcelona Foundation . The FC Barcelona Foundation is an entity set up in 1994 on the suggestion of then-chairman of the Economical-Statutory Committee , Jaime Gil-Aluja . The idea was to set up a foundation that could attract financial sponsorships to support a non-profit sport company . In 2004 , a company could become one of 25 " Honorary members " by contributing between £40,000–60,000 ( £54,800–82,300 ) per year . There are also 48 associate memberships available for an annual fee of £14,000 ( £19,200 ) and an unlimited number of " patronages " for the cost of £4,000 per year ( £5,500 ) . It is unclear whether the honorary members have any formal say in club policy , but according to the author Anthony King , it is " unlikely that Honorary Membership would not involve at least some informal influence over the club " .
White light can be formed by mixing differently colored lights ; the most common method is to use red , green , and blue ( RGB ) . Hence the method is called multi-color white LEDs ( sometimes referred to as RGB LEDs ) . Because these need electronic circuits to control the blending and diffusion of different colors , and because the individual color LEDs typically have slightly different emission patterns ( leading to variation of the color depending on direction ) even if they are made as a single unit , these are seldom used to produce white lighting . Nonetheless , this method has many applications because of the flexibility of mixing different colors , and in principle , this mechanism also has higher quantum efficiency in producing white light .

Unlike other Germanic languages , Dutch does n't have phonological aspiration of consonants . Like English , Dutch did not participate in the second consonant shift . Like most Germanic languages , the Dutch consonant system did not undergo the High German consonant shift and has a syllable structure that allows fairly complex consonant clusters . Dutch also retains full use of the velar fricatives that were present in Proto-Germanic , but lost or modified in many other Germanic languages . Dutch has final-obstruent devoicing : at the end of a word , voicing distinction is neutralised and all obstruents are pronounced voiceless . For example , goede ( " good " ) is /ˈɣudə/ but the related form goed is /ɣut/ . Dutch shares with German Final-obstruent devoicing ( Du brood [ broːt ] and German Brot vs Eng bread ) .
The topic of language for writers from Dalmatia and Dubrovnik prior to the 19th century made a distinction only between speakers of Italian or Slavic , since those were the two main groups that inhabited Dalmatian city-states at that time . Whether someone spoke Croatian or Serbian was not an important distinction then , as the two languages were not distinguished by most speakers . This has been used as an argument to state that Croatian literature Croatian per se , but also includes Serbian and other languages that are part of Serbo-Croatian , These facts undermine the Croatian language proponents ' argument that modern-day Croatian is based on a language called Old Croatian .
Software testing is a part of the software quality assurance ( SQA ) process . :347 In SQA , software process specialists and auditors are concerned for the software development process rather than just the artifacts such as documentation , code and systems . They examine and change the software engineering process itself to reduce the number of faults that end up in the delivered software : the so-called " defect rate " . What constitutes an " acceptable defect rate " depends on the nature of the software ; A flight simulator video game would have much higher defect tolerance than software for an actual airplane . Although there are close links with SQA , testing departments often exist independently , and there may be no SQA function in some companies . [ citation needed ]
Since the Carnation Revolution of 1974 , which culminated in the end of one of Portugal 's most notable phases of economic expansion ( that started in the 1960s ) , a significant change has occurred in the nation 's annual economic growth . [ citation needed ] After the turmoil of the 1974 revolution and the PREC period , Portugal tried to adapt to a changing modern global economy , a process that continues in 2013 . Since the 1990s , Portugal 's public consumption-based economic development model has been slowly changing to a system that is focused on exports , private investment and the development of the high-tech sector . Consequently , business services have overtaken more traditional industries such as textiles , clothing , footwear and cork ( Portugal is the world 's leading cork producer ) , wood products and beverages .
The James River reaches tidewater at Richmond where flooding may occur in every month of the year , most frequently in March and least in July . Hurricanes and tropical storms have been responsible for most of the flooding during the summer and early fall months . Hurricanes passing near Richmond have produced record rainfalls . In 1955 , three hurricanes brought record rainfall to Richmond within a six-week period . The most noteworthy of these were Hurricane Connie and Hurricane Diane that brought heavy rains five days apart . And in 2004 , the downtown area suffered extensive flood damage after the remnants of Hurricane Gaston dumped up to 12 inches ( 300 mm ) of rainfall .
Discrete transistors are individually packaged transistors . Transistors come in many different semiconductor packages ( see image ) . The two main categories are through-hole ( or leaded ) , and surface-mount , also known as surface-mount device ( SMD ) . The ball grid array ( BGA ) is the latest surface-mount package ( currently only for large integrated circuits ) . It has solder " balls " on the underside in place of leads . Because they are smaller and have shorter interconnections , SMDs have better high-frequency characteristics but lower power rating .
Linguistic anthropology ( also called anthropological linguistics ) seeks to understand the processes of human communications , verbal and non-verbal , variation in language across time and space , the social uses of language , and the relationship between language and culture . It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems , linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes . Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics , pragmatics , cognitive linguistics , semiotics , discourse analysis , and narrative analysis .
Norfolk Island is the only non-mainland Australian territory to have achieved self-governance . The Norfolk Island Act 1979 , passed by the Parliament of Australia in 1979 , is the Act under which the island was governed until the passing of the Norfolk Island Legislation Amendment Act 2015 . The Australian government maintains authority on the island through an Administrator , currently Gary Hardgrave . From 1979 to 2015 , a Legislative Assembly was elected by popular vote for terms of not more than three years , although legislation passed by the Australian Parliament could extend its laws to the territory at will , including the power to override any laws made by the assembly .
Through Victoria 's reign , the gradual establishment of a modern constitutional monarchy in Britain continued . Reforms of the voting system increased the power of the House of Commons at the expense of the House of Lords and the monarch . In 1867 , Walter Bagehot wrote that the monarch only retained " the right to be consulted , the right to encourage , and the right to warn " . As Victoria 's monarchy became more symbolic than political , it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values , in contrast to the sexual , financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the House of Hanover and which had discredited the monarchy . The concept of the " family monarchy " , with which the burgeoning middle classes could identify , was solidified .
Under Peter I ( the Great ) , Russia was proclaimed an Empire in 1721 and became recognized as a world power . Ruling from 1682 to 1725 , Peter defeated Sweden in the Great Northern War , forcing it to cede West Karelia and Ingria ( two regions lost by Russia in the Time of Troubles ) , as well as Estland and Livland , securing Russia 's access to the sea and sea trade . On the Baltic Sea Peter founded a new capital called Saint Petersburg , later known as Russia 's Window to Europe . Peter the Great 's reforms brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia . Catherine II ( the Great ) , who ruled in 1762–96 , extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the Partitions of Poland , pushing the Russian frontier westward into Central Europe . In the south , after successful Russo-Turkish Wars against the Ottoman Empire , Catherine advanced Russia 's boundary to the Black Sea , defeating the Crimean khanate .
The league held its first season in 1992–93 and was originally composed of 22 clubs . The first ever Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2–1 win against Manchester United . The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were Arsenal , Aston Villa , Blackburn Rovers , Chelsea , Coventry City , Crystal Palace , Everton , Ipswich Town , Leeds United , Liverpool , Manchester City , Manchester United , Middlesbrough , Norwich City , Nottingham Forest , Oldham Athletic , Queens Park Rangers , Sheffield United , Sheffield Wednesday , Southampton , Tottenham Hotspur , and Wimbledon . Luton Town , Notts County and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old first division at the end of the 1991–92 season , and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season .
By the time Oklahoma was admitted to the Union in 1907 , Oklahoma City had surpassed Guthrie , the territorial capital , as the population center and commercial hub of the new state . Soon after , the capital was moved from Guthrie to Oklahoma City . Oklahoma City was a major stop on Route 66 during the early part of the 20th century ; it was prominently mentioned in Bobby Troup 's 1946 jazz classic , " ( Get Your Kicks on ) Route 66 " , later made famous by artist Nat King Cole .
Providing sufficient base drive current is a key problem in the use of bipolar transistors as switches . The transistor provides current gain , allowing a relatively large current in the collector to be switched by a much smaller current into the base terminal . The ratio of these currents varies depending on the type of transistor , and even for a particular type , varies depending on the collector current . In the example light-switch circuit shown , the resistor is chosen to provide enough base current to ensure the transistor will be saturated .
The first known European explorer to reach Bermuda was Spanish sea captain Juan de Bermúdez in 1503 , after whom the islands are named . He claimed the apparently uninhabited islands for the Spanish Empire . Paying two visits to the archipelago , Bermúdez never landed on the islands , but did create a recognisable map of the archipelago . Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners are now thought to have been responsible for the 1543 inscription in Portuguese Rock ( previously called Spanish Rock ) . Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there , which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began . In 1609 , the English Virginia Company , which had established Jamestown in Virginia ( a term originally applied to all of the North American continent ) two years earlier , permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane , when the crew and passengers of the Sea Venture steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent its sinking , then landed ashore .
Capacitors made with any type of dielectric material will show some level of " dielectric absorption " or " soakage " . On discharging a capacitor and disconnecting it , after a short time it may develop a voltage due to hysteresis in the dielectric . This effect can be objectionable in applications such as precision sample and hold circuits or timing circuits . The level of absorption depends on many factors , from design considerations to charging time , since the absorption is a time-dependent process . However , the primary factor is the type of dielectric material . Capacitors such as tantalum electrolytic or polysulfone film exhibit very high absorption , while polystyrene or Teflon allow very small levels of absorption . In some capacitors where dangerous voltages and energies exist , such as in flashtubes , television sets , and defibrillators , the dielectric absorption can recharge the capacitor to hazardous voltages after it has been shorted or discharged . Any capacitor containing over 10 joules of energy is generally considered hazardous , while 50 joules or higher is potentially lethal . A capacitor may regain anywhere from 0.01 to 20 % of its original charge over a period of several minutes , allowing a seemingly safe capacitor to become surprisingly dangerous .
After secession , some North Carolinians refused to support the Confederacy . Some of the yeoman farmers in the state 's mountains and western Piedmont region remained neutral during the Civil War , while some covertly supported the Union cause during the conflict . Approximately 2,000 North Carolinians from western North Carolina enlisted in the Union Army and fought for the North in the war . Two additional Union Army regiments were raised in the coastal areas of the state , which were occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863 . Numerous slaves escaped to Union lines , where they became essentially free .
Bateman was responsible for the building of 36 new buildings for the university both on and off campus , including the expansion of the Harold B. Lee Library . He was also one of several key college leaders who brought about the creation of the Mountain West Conference , which BYU 's athletics program joined — BYU previously participated in the Western Athletic Conference . A BYU satellite TV network also opened in 2000 under his leadership . Bateman was also president during the September 11th attacks in 2001 . The planes crashed on a Tuesday , hours before the weekly devotional normally held at BYU . Previous plans for the devotional were altered , as Bateman led the student body in a prayer for peace . Bateman was followed by Cecil O. Samuelson in 2003 . Samuelson was succeeded by Kevin J Worthen in 2014 .
Liverpool produced a number of nationally and internationally successful popular singers in the 1950s , including traditional pop stars Frankie Vaughan and Lita Roza , and one of the most successful British rock and roll stars in Billy Fury . Many Lancashire towns had vibrant skiffle scenes in the late 1950s , out of which by the early 1960s a flourishing culture of beat groups began to emerge , particularly around Liverpool and Manchester . It has been estimated that there were around 350 bands active in and around Liverpool in this era , often playing ballrooms , concert halls and clubs , among them the Beatles . After their national success from 1962 , a number of Liverpool performers were able to follow them into the charts , including Gerry & the Pacemakers , the Searchers and Cilla Black . The first act to break through in the UK who were not from Liverpool , or managed by Brian Epstein , were Freddie and the Dreamers , who were based in Manchester , as were Herman 's Hermits and the Hollies . Led by the Beatles , beat groups from the region spearheaded the British Invasion of the US , which made a major contribution to the development of rock music . After the decline of beat groups in the late 1960s the centre of rock culture shifted to London and there were relatively few local bands who achieved national prominence until the growth of a disco funk scene and the punk rock revolution in the mid and late 1970s .
From 1996 to 2002 , Tuvalu was one of the best-performing Pacific Island economies and achieved an average real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth rate of 5.6 % per annum . Since 2002 economic growth has slowed , with GDP growth of 1.5 % in 2008 . Tuvalu was exposed to rapid rises in world prices of fuel and food in 2008 , with the level of inflation peaking at 13.4 % . The International Monetary Fund 2010 Report on Tuvalu estimates that Tuvalu experienced zero growth in its 2010 GDP , after the economy contracted by about 2 % in 2009 . On 5 August 2012 , the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) concluded the Article IV consultation with Tuvalu , and assessed the economy of Tuvalu : " A slow recovery is underway in Tuvalu , but there are important risks . GDP grew in 2011 for the first time since the global financial crisis , led by the private retail sector and education spending . We expect growth to rise slowly " . The IMF 2014 Country Report noted that real GDP growth in Tuvalu had been volatile averaging only 1 percent in the past decade . The 2014 Country Report describes economic growth prospects as generally positive as the result of large revenues from fishing licenses , together with substantial foreign aid .
Plymouth is home to the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom ( MBA ) which conducts research in all areas of the marine sciences . The Plymouth Marine Laboratory is an offshoot of the MBA . Together with the National Marine Aquarium , the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Sciences , Plymouth University 's Marine Institute and the Diving Diseases Research Centre , these marine-related organisations form the Plymouth Marine Sciences Partnership . The Plymouth Marine Laboratory , which focuses on global issues of climate change and sustainability . It monitors the effects of ocean acidity on corals and shellfish and reports the results to the UK government . It also cultivates algae that could be used to make biofuels or in the treatment of waste water by using technology such as photo-bioreactors . It works alongside the Boots Group to investigate the use of algae in skin care protects , taking advantage of the chemicals they contain that adapt to protect themselves from the sun .
These deities formed a core pantheon ; there were additionally hundreds of minor ones . Sumerian gods could thus have associations with different cities , and their religious importance often waxed and waned with those cities ' political power . The gods were said to have created human beings from clay for the purpose of serving them . The temples organized the mass labour projects needed for irrigation agriculture . Citizens had a labor duty to the temple , though they could avoid it by a payment of silver .
The manipulation of time at higher latitudes ( for example Iceland , Nunavut or Alaska ) has little impact on daily life , because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons ( in comparison to other latitudes ) , and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of sync with standard working hours regardless of manipulations of the clock . DST is also of little use for locations near the equator , because these regions see only a small variation in daylight in the course of the year .
Ter-Petrosyan led Armenia alongside Defense Minister Vazgen Sargsyan through the Nagorno-Karabakh War with neighboring Azerbaijan . The initial post-Soviet years were marred by economic difficulties , which had their roots early in the Karabakh conflict when the Azerbaijani Popular Front managed to pressure the Azerbaijan SSR to instigate a railway and air blockade against Armenia . This move effectively crippled Armenia 's economy as 85 % of its cargo and goods arrived through rail traffic . In 1993 , Turkey joined the blockade against Armenia in support of Azerbaijan .
London was the world 's largest city from about 1831 to 1925 . London 's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics , claiming 14,000 lives in 1848 , and 6,000 in 1866 . Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world 's first local urban rail network . The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties ; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital . London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War while during the Second World War , the Blitz and other bombings by the German Luftwaffe , killed over 30,000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city . Immediately after the war , the 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium , at a time when London had barely recovered from the war .
Pub names are used to identify and differentiate each pub . Modern names are sometimes a marketing ploy or attempt to create " brand awareness " , frequently using a comic theme thought to be memorable , Slug and Lettuce for a pub chain being an example . Interesting origins are not confined to old or traditional names , however . Names and their origins can be broken up into a relatively small number of categories .
The team worked on a Wii control scheme , adapting camera control and the fighting mechanics to the new interface . A prototype was created that used a swinging gesture to control the sword from a first-person viewpoint , but was unable to show the variety of Link 's movements . When the third-person view was restored , Aonuma thought it felt strange to swing the Wii Remote with the right hand to control the sword in Link 's left hand , so the entire Wii version map was mirrored . [ p ] Details about Wii controls began to surface in December 2005 when British publication NGC Magazine claimed that when a GameCube copy of Twilight Princess was played on the Revolution , it would give the player the option of using the Revolution controller . Miyamoto confirmed the Revolution controller-functionality in an interview with Nintendo of Europe and Time reported this soon after . However , support for the Wii controller did not make it into the GameCube release . At E3 2006 , Nintendo announced that both versions would be available at the Wii launch , and had a playable version of Twilight Princess for the Wii . [ p ] Later , the GameCube release was pushed back to a month after the launch of the Wii .
Some other popular sights are the Waterloo Column , the Laves House , the Wangenheim Palace , the Lower Saxony State Archives , the Hanover Playhouse , the Kröpcke Clock , the Anzeiger Tower Block , the Administration Building of the NORD/LB , the Cupola Hall of the Congress Centre , the Lower Saxony Stock , the Ministry of Finance , the Garten Church , the Luther Church , the Gehry Tower ( designed by the American architect Frank O. Gehry ) , the specially designed Bus Stops , the Opera House , the Central Station , the Maschsee lake and the city forest Eilenriede , which is one of the largest of its kind in Europe . With around 40 parks , forests and gardens , a couple of lakes , two rivers and one canal , Hanover offers a large variety of leisure activities .
The front page caused outrage in Liverpool , where the paper lost more than three-quarters of its estimated 55,000 daily sales and still sells poorly in the city more than 25 years later ( around 12,000 ) . It is unavailable in many parts of the city , as many newsagents refuse to stock it . It was revealed in a documentary called Alexei Sayle 's Liverpool , aired in September 2008 , that many Liverpudlians will not even take the newspaper for free , and those who do may simply burn or tear it up . Liverpudlians refer to the paper as 'The Scum ' with campaigners believing it handicapped their fight for justice .
However , not all highest courts are named as such . Civil law states do not tend to have singular highest courts . Additionally , the highest court in some jurisdictions is not named the " Supreme Court " , for example , the High Court of Australia ; this is because decisions by the High Court could formerly be appealed to the Privy Council . On the other hand , in some places the court named the " Supreme Court " is not in fact the highest court ; examples include the New York Supreme Court , the Supreme Courts of several Canadian provinces/territories and the former Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales , which are all superseded by higher Courts of Appeal .
In 1924 , the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created as a part of Uzbekistan , but in 1929 the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic ( Tajik SSR ) was made a separate constituent republic , however the predominantly ethnic Tajik cities of Samarkand and Bukhara remained in the Uzbek SSR . Between 1927 and 1934 , collectivization of agriculture and a rapid expansion of cotton production took place , especially in the southern region . Soviet collectivization policy brought violence against peasants and forced resettlement occurred throughout Tajikistan . Consequently , some peasants fought collectivization and revived the Basmachi movement . Some small scale industrial development also occurred during this time along with the expansion of irrigation infrastructure .
North Carolina Museum of Art , occupying a large suburban campus on Blue Ridge Road near the North Carolina State Fairgrounds , maintains one of the premier public art collections located between Washington , D.C. , and Atlanta . In addition to its extensive collections of American Art , European Art and ancient art , the museum recently has hosted major exhibitions featuring Auguste Rodin ( in 2000 ) and Claude Monet ( in 2006-07 ) , each attracting more than 200,000 visitors . Unlike most prominent public museums , the North Carolina Museum of Art acquired a large number of the works in its permanent collection through purchases with public funds . The museum 's outdoor park is one of the largest such art parks in the country . The museum facility underwent a major expansion which greatly expanded the exhibit space that was completed in 2010 . The 127,000 sf new expansion is designed by NYC architect Thomas Phifer and Partners .
Some sections of the state feature architectural styles including Spanish revival , Florida vernacular , and Mediterranean Revival Style . It has the largest collection of Art Deco and Streamline Moderne buildings in both the United States and the entire world , most of which are located in the Miami metropolitan area , especially Miami Beach 's Art Deco District , constructed as the city was becoming a resort destination . A unique architectural design found only in Florida is the post-World War II Miami Modern , which can be seen in areas such as Miami 's MiMo Historic District .
Between the 1992–93 season and the 2012–13 season , Premier League clubs had won the UEFA Champions League four times ( as well as supplying five of the runners-up ) , behind Spain 's La Liga with six wins , and Italy 's Serie A with five wins , and ahead of , among others , Germany 's Bundesliga with three wins ( see table here ) . The FIFA Club World Cup ( or the FIFA Club World Championship , as it was originally called ) has been won by Premier league clubs once ( Manchester United in 2008 ) , and they have also been runners-up twice , behind Brazil 's Brasileirão with four wins , and Spain 's La Liga and Italy 's Serie A with two wins each ( see table here ) .
In the spring of 1854 the Russians again advanced , crossing the Danube River into the Turkish province of Dobruja . By April 1854 , the Russians had reached the lines of Trajan 's Wall where they were finally halted . In the center , the Russian forces crossed the Danube and laid siege to Silistra from 14 April with 60,000 troops , the defenders with 15,000 had supplies for three months . :415 The siege was lifted on 23 June 1854 . The English and French forces at this time were unable to take the field for lack of equipment . :415
The other usage refers to a language that is socially subordinated to a regional or national standard language , often historically cognate or related to the standard language , but not actually derived from it . In this sense , unlike in the first usage , the standard language would not itself be considered a " dialect , " as it is the dominant language in a particular state or region , whether in terms of social or political status , official status , predominance or prevalence , or all of the above . Meanwhile , the " dialects " subordinate to the standard language are generally not variations on the standard language but rather separate ( but often related ) languages in and of themselves . For example , most of the various regional Romance languages of Italy , often colloquially referred to as Italian " dialects , " are , in fact , not actually derived from modern standard Italian , but rather evolved from Vulgar Latin separately and individually from one another and independently of standard Italian , long prior to the diffusion of a national standardized language throughout what is now Italy . These various Latin-derived regional languages are therefore , in a linguistic sense , not truly " dialects " of the standard Italian language , but are instead better defined as their own separate languages . Conversely , with the spread of standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century , various regional versions or varieties of standard Italian developed , generally as a mix of the national standard Italian with local regional languages and local accents . These variations on standard Italian , known as regional Italian , would more appropriately be called " dialects " in accordance with the first linguistic definition of " dialect , " as they are in fact derived partially or mostly from standard Italian .
In the 1960s , the first Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed , and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time . The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China , having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise . Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968 , the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 metres on the upper deck , with approximately 1,580 metres spanning the river itself . Since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built . Going in the downstream direction , the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are : Dashengguan Bridge , Line 10 Metro Tunnel , Third Bridge , Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel , First Bridge , Second Bridge and Fourth Bridge .
The 1920s , with tourism at its peak , are considered by many historians as Atlantic City 's golden age . During Prohibition , which was enacted nationally in 1919 and lasted until 1933 , much liquor was consumed and gambling regularly took place in the back rooms of nightclubs and restaurants . It was during Prohibition that racketeer and political boss Enoch L. " Nucky " Johnson rose to power . Prohibition was largely unenforced in Atlantic City , and , because alcohol that had been smuggled into the city with the acquiescence of local officials could be readily obtained at restaurants and other establishments , the resort 's popularity grew further . The city then dubbed itself as " The World 's Playground " . Nucky Johnson 's income , which reached as much as $ 500,000 annually , came from the kickbacks he took on illegal liquor , gambling and prostitution operating in the city , as well as from kickbacks on construction projects .
The New York City Fire Department ( FDNY ) , provides fire protection , technical rescue , primary response to biological , chemical , and radioactive hazards , and emergency medical services for the five boroughs of New York City . The New York City Fire Department is the largest municipal fire department in the United States and the second largest in the world after the Tokyo Fire Department . The FDNY employs approximately 11,080 uniformed firefighters and over 3,300 uniformed EMTs and paramedics . The FDNY 's motto is New York 's Bravest .
The history of time in the United States includes DST during both world wars , but no standardization of peacetime DST until 1966 . In May 1965 , for two weeks , St. Paul , Minnesota and Minneapolis , Minnesota were on different times , when the capital city decided to join most of the nation by starting Daylight Saving Time while Minneapolis opted to follow the later date set by state law . In the mid-1980s , Clorox ( parent of Kingsford Charcoal ) and 7-Eleven provided the primary funding for the Daylight Saving Time Coalition behind the 1987 extension to US DST , and both Idaho senators voted for it based on the premise that during DST fast-food restaurants sell more French fries , which are made from Idaho potatoes .
Her Majesty 's Courts Service provide a Magistrates ' Court and a Combined Crown and County Court in the city . The Plymouth Borough Police , formed in 1836 , eventually became part of Devon and Cornwall Constabulary . There are police stations at Charles Cross and Crownhill ( the Divisional HQ ) and smaller stations at Plympton and Plymstock . The city has one of the Devon and Cornwall Area Crown Prosecution Service Divisional offices . Plymouth has five fire stations located in Camel 's Head , Crownhill , Greenbank , Plympton and Plymstock which is part of Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service . The Royal National Lifeboat Institution have an Atlantic 85 class lifeboat and Severn class lifeboat stationed at Millbay Docks .
The preserved records of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt ( the Reich Security Main Office ) show the persecution of Freemasons during the Holocaust . RSHA Amt VII ( Written Records ) was overseen by Professor Franz Six and was responsible for " ideological " tasks , by which was meant the creation of antisemitic and anti-Masonic propaganda . While the number is not accurately known , it is estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 Freemasons were killed under the Nazi regime . Masonic concentration camp inmates were graded as political prisoners and wore an inverted red triangle .
A psychological identity relates to self-image ( one 's mental model of oneself ) , self-esteem , and individuality . Consequently , Weinreich gives the definition " A person 's identity is defined as the totality of one 's self-construal , in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future " ; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity , such as : " One 's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one 's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one 's construal of past ancestry and one 's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity " ( Weinreich , 1986a ) .
The mandolin has been used extensively in the traditional music of England and Scotland for generations . Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums , instructional books and DVDs , as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents . The instrument has also found its way into British rock music . The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield ( and introduced by Vivian Stanshall ) on Oldfield 's album Tubular Bells , as well as on a number of his subsequent albums ( particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge ( 1974 ) and Ommadawn ( 1975 ) ) . It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne , who featured two members on the instrument , Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe , and whose " Fog on the Tyne " was the biggest selling UK album of 1971-1972 . The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs . Maggie May by Rod Stewart , which hit No . 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100 , also featured Jackson 's playing . It has also been used by other British rock musicians . Led Zeppelin 's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That 's the Way ; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page , who composed the song . Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do , and Black Country Woman . Pete Townshend of The Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme , along with many other tracks on Endless Wire . McGuinness Flint , for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single , When I 'm Dead And Gone , is another example . Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane 's Slim Chance , and played mandolin on their hit How Come . One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in The Incredible String Band . Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player ( beautiful track Pussy Willow ) , as is his guitarist Martin Barre . The popular song Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr . More recently , the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin , played by Ailidh Lennon , on tracks such as Fight , Start to End , and Medicine . British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs . Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London 's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs . The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse . It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney 's 2007 hit " Dance Tonight . " That was not the first time a Beatle played a mandolin , however ; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo , the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name . The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people . Also more recently hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures have been playing a song based primarily using a mandolin . This song was left off their debut album , and features former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones . [ citation needed ]
In addition , most Grand Lodges require the candidate to declare a belief in a Supreme Being . In a few cases , the candidate may be required to be of a specific religion . The form of Freemasonry most common in Scandinavia ( known as the Swedish Rite ) , for example , accepts only Christians . At the other end of the spectrum , " Liberal " or Continental Freemasonry , exemplified by the Grand Orient de France , does not require a declaration of belief in any deity , and accepts atheists ( a cause of discord with the rest of Freemasonry ) .
Christianity , Judaism , Zoroastrianism , and the Sunni branch of Islam are officially recognized by the government , and have reserved seats in the Iranian Parliament . But the Bahá'í Faith , which is said to be the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran , is not officially recognized , and has been persecuted during its existence in Iran since the 19th century . Since the 1979 Revolution , the persecution of Bahais has increased with executions , the denial of civil rights and liberties , and the denial of access to higher education and employment .
Cork is home to the RTÉ Vanbrugh Quartet , and to many musical acts , including John Spillane , The Frank And Walters , Sultans of Ping , Simple Kid , Microdisney , Fred , Mick Flannery and the late Rory Gallagher .

In the Middle Ages , several powerful Somali empires dominated the regional trade including the Ajuran Sultanate , which excelled in hydraulic engineering and fortress building , the Sultanate of Adal , whose general Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi ( Ahmed Gurey ) was the first commander to use cannon warfare on the continent during Adal 's conquest of the Ethiopian Empire , and the Sultanate of the Geledi , whose military dominance forced governors of the Omani empire north of the city of Lamu to pay tribute to the Somali Sultan Ahmed Yusuf .
From the 10th to the 13th century , Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction , affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland , Croatia , Sweden and Sicily . The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture , but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place , as did the expressions of Gothic taste . The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders do not define divisions of style . On the other hand , some regions such as England and Spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere , except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen , or the transfer of bishops . Regional differences that are apparent in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period often become even more apparent in the Gothic .
The only foreign diplomatic experience Montini underwent was his time in the nunciature in Warsaw , Poland in 1923 . Like Achille Ratti before him , [ a ] he felt confronted with the huge problem , not limited to Poland , of excessive nationalism : " This form of nationalism treats foreigners as enemies , especially foreigners with whom one has common frontiers . Then one seeks the expansion of one 's own country at the expense of the immediate neighbours . People grow up with a feeling of being hemmed in . Peace becomes a transient compromise between wars . " When he was recalled to Rome he was happy to go , because " this concludes this episode of my life , which has provided useful , though not always joyful , experiences . "
Although they did not fix their schedules to the clock in the modern sense , ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than modern DST does , often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of day length , so that each daylight hour was longer during summer . For example , Roman water clocks had different scales for different months of the year : at Rome 's latitude the third hour from sunrise , hora tertia , started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice , but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes . After ancient times , equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal , so civil time no longer varies by season . Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings , such as some Mount Athos monasteries and all Jewish ceremonies .
The Red Rose of Lancaster is the county flower found on the county 's heraldic badge and flag . The rose was a symbol of the House of Lancaster , immortalised in the verse " In the battle for England 's head/York was white , Lancaster red " ( referring to the 15th-century Wars of the Roses ) . The traditional Lancashire flag , a red rose on a white field , was not officially registered . When an attempt was made to register it with the Flag Institute it was found that it was officially registered by Montrose in Scotland , several hundred years earlier with the Lyon Office . Lancashire 's official flag is registered as a red rose on a gold field .
The army was still equipped with the Dreyse needle gun of Battle of Königgrätz fame , which was by this time showing the age of its 25-year-old design . The rifle had a range of only 600 m ( 2,000 ft ) and lacked the rubber breech seal that permitted aimed shots . The deficiencies of the needle gun were more than compensated for by the famous Krupp 6-pounder ( 3 kg ) steel breech-loading cannons being issued to Prussian artillery batteries . Firing a contact-detonated shell , the Krupp gun had a longer range and a higher rate of fire than the French bronze muzzle loading cannon , which relied on faulty time fuses .
From their beginnings in Sumer ( now Iraq ) around 3500 BC , the Mesopotamian people began to attempt to record some observations of the world with numerical data . But their observations and measurements were seemingly taken for purposes other than for elucidating scientific laws . A concrete instance of Pythagoras ' law was recorded , as early as the 18th century BC : the Mesopotamian cuneiform tablet Plimpton 322 records a number of Pythagorean triplets ( 3,4,5 ) ( 5,12,13 ) . ... , dated 1900 BC , possibly millennia before Pythagoras , but an abstract formulation of the Pythagorean theorem was not .
In 1984 , he was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour by Queen Elizabeth II on the advice of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for his " services to the study of economics " . He was the first recipient of the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize in 1984 . He also received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 from President George H. W. Bush . In 2011 , his article " The Use of Knowledge in Society " was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in The American Economic Review during its first 100 years .
Natural uranium consists of three major isotopes : uranium-238 ( 99.28 % natural abundance ) , uranium-235 ( 0.71 % ) , and uranium-234 ( 0.0054 % ) . All three are radioactive , emitting alpha particles , with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission , rather than alpha emission . There are also five other trace isotopes : uranium-239 , which is formed when 238U undergoes spontaneous fission , releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom ; uranium-237 , which is formed when 238U captures a neutron but emits two more , which then decays to neptunium-237 ; uranium-233 , which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237 ; and finally , uranium-236 and -240 , which appear in the decay chain of primordial plutonium-244 . It is also expected that thorium-232 should be able to undergo double beta decay , which would produce uranium-232 , but this has not yet been observed experimentally .
Islam and Judaism have a complex relationship . Traditionally Jews and Christians living in Muslim lands , known as dhimmis , were allowed to practice their religions and administer their internal affairs , but they were subject to certain conditions . They had to pay the jizya ( a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males ) to the Islamic state . Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule . They had several social and legal disabilities such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims . Many of the disabilities were highly symbolic . The one described by Bernard Lewis as " most degrading " was the requirement of distinctive clothing , not found in the Quran or hadith but invented in early medieval Baghdad ; its enforcement was highly erratic . On the other hand , Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile , or forced compulsion to change their religion , and they were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession .
Saint Helena produces what is said to be the most expensive coffee in the world . It also produces and exports Tungi Spirit , made from the fruit of the prickly or cactus pears , Opuntia ficus-indica ( " Tungi " is the local St Helenian name for the plant ) . Ascension Island , Tristan da Cunha and Saint Helena all issue their own postage stamps which provide a significant income .
In glaciated areas where the glacier moves faster than one km per year , glacial earthquakes occur . These are large scale temblors that have seismic magnitudes as high as 6.1 . The number of glacial earthquakes in Greenland peaks every year in July , August and September and is increasing over time . In a study using data from January 1993 through October 2005 , more events were detected every year since 2002 , and twice as many events were recorded in 2005 as there were in any other year . This increase in the numbers of glacial earthquakes in Greenland may be a response to global warming .
Many units are supplemented with a variety of specialized weapons , including the M249 SAW ( Squad Automatic Weapon ) , to provide suppressive fire at the fire-team level . Indirect fire is provided by the M203 grenade launcher . The M1014 Joint Service Combat Shotgun or the Mossberg 590 Shotgun are used for door breaching and close-quarters combat . The M14EBR is used by designated marksmen . Snipers use the M107 Long Range Sniper Rifle , the M2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle , and the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper Rifle .
The Japanese enlarged administration and appointed local leaders , which weakened the authority of local traditional leaders . Japan also tried to change the social organization in the islands from Matrilineality to the Japanese Patriarchal system , but with no success . Moreover , during the 1930s , one third of all land up to the high water level was declared the property of the Japanese government . On the archipelago , before it banned foreign traders , the activities of Catholic and Protestant missionaries were allowed . Indigenous people were educated in Japanese schools , and studied Japanese language and Japanese culture . This policy was the government strategy not only in the Marshall Islands , but on all the other mandated territories in Micronesia . On March 27 , 1933 , Japan handed in its notice at the League of Nations , but continued to manage the islands , and in the late 1930s began building air bases on several atolls . The Marshall Islands were in an important geographical position , being the easternmost point in Japan 's defensive ring at the beginning of World War II .
In 1888 , the Italian administration launched its first development projects in the new colony . The Eritrean Railway was completed to Saati in 1888 , and reached Asmara in the highlands in 1911 . The Asmara–Massawa Cableway was the longest line in the world during its time , but was later dismantled by the British in World War II . Besides major infrastructural projects , the colonial authorities invested significantly in the agricultural sector . It also oversaw the provision of urban amenities in Asmara and Massawa , and employed many Eritreans in public service , particularly in the police and public works departments . Thousands of Eritreans were concurrently enlisted in the army , serving during the Italo-Turkish War in Libya as well as the First and second Italo-Abyssinian Wars .
Apollo ( Attic , Ionic , and Homeric Greek : Ἀπόλλων , Apollōn ( GEN Ἀπόλλωνος ) ; Doric : Ἀπέλλων , Apellōn ; Arcadocypriot : Ἀπείλων , Apeilōn ; Aeolic : Ἄπλουν , Aploun ; Latin : Apollō ) is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology . The ideal of the kouros ( a beardless , athletic youth ) , Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music , truth and prophecy , healing , the sun and light , plague , poetry , and more . Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto , and has a twin sister , the chaste huntress Artemis . Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu .
The Sultanate of Ifat , led by the Walashma dynasty with its capital at Zeila , ruled over parts of what is now eastern Ethiopia , Djibouti , and northern Somalia . The historian al-Umari records that Ifat was situated near the Red Sea coast , and states its size as 15 days travel by 20 days travel . Its army numbered 15,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers . Al-Umari also credits Ifat with seven " mother cities " : Belqulzar , Kuljura , Shimi , Shewa , Adal , Jamme and Laboo .
He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics , in the development of functional analysis , a principal member of the Manhattan Project and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton ( as one of the few originally appointed ) , and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata , the universal constructor and the digital computer . He published 150 papers in his life ; 60 in pure mathematics , 20 in physics , and 60 in applied mathematics . His last work , an unfinished manuscript written while in the hospital , was later published in book form as The Computer and the Brain .
Nick Fradiani won the season , defeating Clark Beckham . By winning , Fradiani became the first winner from the Northeast region . Fradiani released " Beautiful Life " as his coronation single while Beckham released " Champion " . Jax , the third place finalist , also released a single called " Forcefield " .
In the last years of the nineteenth century , Planck was investigating the problem of black-body radiation first posed by Kirchhoff some forty years earlier . It is well known that hot objects glow , and that hotter objects glow brighter than cooler ones . The electromagnetic field obeys laws of motion similarly to a mass on a spring , and can come to thermal equilibrium with hot atoms . The hot object in equilibrium with light absorbs just as much light as it emits . If the object is black , meaning it absorbs all the light that hits it , then its thermal light emission is maximized .
If a more consistent report with the genetic groups in the gradation of miscegenation is to be considered ( e.g . that would not cluster people with a balanced degree of African and non-African ancestry in the black group instead of the multiracial one , unlike elsewhere in Latin America where people of high quantity of African descent tend to classify themselves as mixed ) , more people would report themselves as white and pardo in Brazil ( 47.7 % and 42.4 % of the population as of 2010 , respectively ) , because by research its population is believed to have between 65 and 80 % of autosomal European ancestry , in average ( also > 35 % of European mt-DNA and > 95 % of European Y-DNA ) .
Burke 's religious writing comprises published works and commentary on the subject of religion . Burke 's religious thought was grounded in the belief that religion is the foundation of civil society . He sharply criticised deism and atheism , and emphasised Christianity as a vehicle of social progress . Born in Ireland to a Catholic mother and a Protestant father , Burke vigorously defended the Anglican Church , but also demonstrated sensitivity to Catholic concerns . He linked the conservation of a state ( established ) religion with the preservation of citizens ' constitutional liberties and highlighted Christianity 's benefit not only to the believer 's soul , but also to political arrangements .
Several solid dielectrics are available , including paper , plastic , glass , mica and ceramic materials . Paper was used extensively in older devices and offers relatively high voltage performance . However , it is susceptible to water absorption , and has been largely replaced by plastic film capacitors . Plastics offer better stability and ageing performance , which makes them useful in timer circuits , although they may be limited to low operating temperatures and frequencies . Ceramic capacitors are generally small , cheap and useful for high frequency applications , although their capacitance varies strongly with voltage and they age poorly . They are broadly categorized as class 1 dielectrics , which have predictable variation of capacitance with temperature or class 2 dielectrics , which can operate at higher voltage . Glass and mica capacitors are extremely reliable , stable and tolerant to high temperatures and voltages , but are too expensive for most mainstream applications . Electrolytic capacitors and supercapacitors are used to store small and larger amounts of energy , respectively , ceramic capacitors are often used in resonators , and parasitic capacitance occurs in circuits wherever the simple conductor-insulator-conductor structure is formed unintentionally by the configuration of the circuit layout .
Even though the Board of Rites and Lifan Yuan performed some duties of a foreign office , they fell short of developing into a professional foreign service . It was not until 1861 — a year after losing the Second Opium War to the Anglo-French coalition — that the Qing government bowed to foreign pressure and created a proper foreign affairs office known as the Zongli Yamen . The office was originally intended to be temporary and was staffed by officials seconded from the Grand Council . However , as dealings with foreigners became increasingly complicated and frequent , the office grew in size and importance , aided by revenue from customs duties which came under its direct jurisdiction .
One disadvantage of the phalanx was that it was only effective when fighting in large , open spaces , which left the Romans at a disadvantage when fighting in the hilly terrain of central Italian peninsula . In the 4th century BC , the Romans abandoned the phalanx in favour of the more flexible manipular formation . This change is sometimes attributed to Marcus Furius Camillus and placed shortly after the Gallic invasion of 390 BC ; it is more likely , however , that they were copied from Rome 's Samnite enemies to the south , possibly as a result of Samnite victories during the Second Samnite War ( 326 to 304 BC ) .
On 20 December 2012 , Pope Benedict XVI , in an audience with the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints , declared that the late pontiff had lived a life of heroic virtue , which means that he could be called " Venerable " . A miracle attributed to the intercession of Paul VI was approved on 9 May 2014 by Pope Francis . The beatification ceremony for Paul VI was held on 19 October 2014 , which means that he can now be called " Blessed " . His liturgical feast day is celebrated on the date of his birth , 26 September , rather than the day of his death as is usual .
London was the world 's largest city from about 1831 to 1925 . London 's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics , claiming 14,000 lives in 1848 , and 6,000 in 1866 . Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world 's first local urban rail network . The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties ; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital . London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War while during the Second World War , the Blitz and other bombings by the German Luftwaffe , killed over 30,000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city . Immediately after the war , the 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium , at a time when London had barely recovered from the war .
In the 13th century , Hōjō Shigetoki ( 1198–1261 AD ) wrote : " When one is serving officially or in the master 's court , he should not think of a hundred or a thousand people , but should consider only the importance of the master . " Carl Steenstrup noted that 13th and 14th century warrior writings ( gunki ) " portrayed the bushi in their natural element , war , eulogizing such virtues as reckless bravery , fierce family pride , and selfless , at times senseless devotion of master and man " . Feudal lords such as Shiba Yoshimasa ( 1350–1410 AD ) stated that a warrior looked forward to a glorious death in the service of a military leader or the Emperor : " It is a matter of regret to let the moment when one should die pass by ... .First , a man whose profession is the use of arms should think and then act upon not only his own fame , but also that of his descendants . He should not scandalize his name forever by holding his one and only life too dear ... .One 's main purpose in throwing away his life is to do so either for the sake of the Emperor or in some great undertaking of a military general . It is that exactly that will be the great fame of one 's descendants . "
The Buddha 's death is seen as an illusion , he is living on in other planes of existence , and monks are therefore permitted to offer " new truths " based on his input . Mahayana also differs from Theravada in its concept of śūnyatā ( that ultimately nothing has existence ) , and in its belief in bodhisattvas ( enlightened people who vow to continue being reborn until all beings can be enlightened ) .
Pope Julius had died in April , 352 , and was succeeded by Liberius . For two years Liberius had been favourable to the cause of Athanasius ; but driven at last into exile , he was induced to sign an ambiguous formula , from which the great Nicene text , the " homoousion " , had been studiously omitted . In 355 a council was held at Milan , where in spite of the vigorous opposition of a handful of loyal prelates among the Western bishops , a fourth condemnation of Athanasius was announced to the world . With his friends scattered , the saintly Hosius in exile , and Pope Liberius denounced as acquiescing in Arian formularies , Athanasius could hardly hope to escape . On the night of 8 February , 356 , while engaged in services in the Church of St. Thomas , a band of armed men burst in to secure his arrest . It was the beginning of his third exile .
The Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale ( Yale 1773 ) was the prototype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th century : a manly yet aristocratic scholar , equally well-versed in knowledge and sports , and a patriot who " regretted " that he " had but one life to lose " for his country . Western painter Frederic Remington ( Yale 1900 ) was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the Wild West . The fictional , turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice , and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel Stover at Yale ( 1911 ) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school . Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes , especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body , and the alumni , as well as the team itself .
On January 25 , 1918 , at the third meeting of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets , the unrecognized state was renamed the Soviet Russian Republic . On March 3 , 1918 , the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed , giving away much of the land of the former Russian Empire to Germany , in exchange for peace in World War I . On July 10 , 1918 , the Russian Constitution of 1918 renamed the country the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic . By 1918 , during the Russian Civil War , several states within the former Russian Empire had seceded , reducing the size of the country even more .
In September 2010 , Brian May announced in a BBC interview that Sacha Baron Cohen was to play Mercury in a film of the same name . Time commented with approval on his singing ability and visual similarity to Mercury . However , in July 2013 , Baron Cohen dropped out of the role due to " creative differences " between him and the surviving band members . In December 2013 , it was announced that Ben Whishaw , best known for playing Q in the James Bond film Skyfall , had been chosen to replace Cohen in the role of Mercury . The motion picture is being written by Peter Morgan , who had been nominated for Oscars for his screenplays The Queen and Frost/Nixon . The film , which is being co-produced by Robert De Niro 's TriBeCa Productions , will focus on Queen 's formative years and the period leading up to the celebrated performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert .
In Apollo 's role as a healer , his appellations included Acesius ( /əˈsiːʒəs/ ə-SEE-zhəs ; Ἀκέσιος , Akesios , from ἄκεσις , " healing " ) , Acestor ( /əˈsɛstər/ ə-SES-tər ; Ἀκέστωρ , Akestōr , literally " healer " ) , Paean ( /ˈpiːən/ PEE-ən ; Παιάν , Paiān , from παίειν , " to touch " ) , [ citation needed ] and Iatrus ( /aɪˈætrəs/ eye-AT-rəs ; Ἰατρός , Iātros , literally " physician " ) . Acesius was the epithet of Apollo worshipped in Elis , where he had a temple in the agora . The Romans referred to Apollo as Medicus ( /ˈmɛdᵻkəs/ MED-i-kəs ; literally " physician " in Latin ) in this respect . A temple was dedicated to Apollo Medicus at Rome , probably next to the temple of Bellona .
The successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors . These include host defense mechanisms , the location of infection , and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial . A bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase , and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells . These findings are based on laboratory studies , and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection . Since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration , in vitro characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial . To predict clinical outcome , the antimicrobial activity of an antibacterial is usually combined with its pharmacokinetic profile , and several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy .
There are 20 clubs in the Premier League . During the course of a season ( from August to May ) each club plays the others twice ( a double round-robin system ) , once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents , for a total of 38 games . Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw . No points are awarded for a loss . Teams are ranked by total points , then goal difference , and then goals scored . If still equal , teams are deemed to occupy the same position . If there is a tie for the championship , for relegation , or for qualification to other competitions , a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank . The three lowest placed teams are relegated into the Football League Championship , and the top two teams from the Championship , together with the winner of play-offs involving the third to sixth placed Championship clubs , are promoted in their place .
The England national football team represents England and the Crown Dependencies of Jersey , Guernsey and the Isle of Man for football matches as part of FIFA-authorised events , and is controlled by The Football Association , the governing body for football in England . England are one of the two oldest national teams in football ; alongside Scotland , whom they played in the world 's first international football match in 1872 . England 's home ground is Wembley Stadium , London , and the current team manager is Roy Hodgson .
The question of whether the government should intervene or not in the regulation of the cyberspace is a very polemical one . Indeed , for as long as it has existed and by definition , the cyberspace is a virtual space free of any government intervention . Where everyone agree that an improvement on cybersecurity is more than vital , is the government the best actor to solve this issue ? Many government officials and experts think that the government should step in and that there is a crucial need for regulation , mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem . R. Clarke said during a panel discussion at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco , he believes that the " industry only responds when you threaten regulation . If industry does n't respond ( to the threat ) , you have to follow through . " On the other hand , executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary , but think that the government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently .
The treaty was published in the United States for the first time by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on May 22 , 1946 , in Britain by the Manchester Guardian . It was also part of an official State Department publication , Nazi–Soviet Relations 1939–1941 , edited by Raymond J. Sontag and James S. Beddie in January 1948 . The decision to publish the key documents on German–Soviet relations , including the treaty and protocol , had been taken already in spring 1947 . Sontag and Beddie prepared the collection throughout the summer of 1947 . In November 1947 , President Truman personally approved the publication but it was held back in view of the Foreign Ministers Conference in London scheduled for December . Since negotiations at that conference did not prove constructive from an American point of view , the document edition was sent to press . The documents made headlines worldwide . State Department officials counted it as a success : " The Soviet Government was caught flat-footed in what was the first effective blow from our side in a clear-cut propaganda war . "
In 2008 , State Council established a counterpart support plan ( 《汶川地震灾后恢复重建对口支援方案》 ) . The plan is to arrange 19 eastern and central province and municipalitie to help 18 counties , on " one province to one affected county " basis . The plan spanned 3 years , and cost no less than one percent of the province or municipality 's budget .
Although the city is not particularly noted for theatre and drama , the state government promotes theatre with multiple programmes and festivals in such venues as the Ravindra Bharati , Shilpakala Vedika and Lalithakala Thoranam . Although not a purely music oriented event , Numaish , a popular annual exhibition of local and national consumer products , does feature some musical performances . The city is home to the Telugu film industry , popularly known as Tollywood and as of 2012 [ update ] , produces the second largest number of films in India behind Bollywood . Films in the local Hyderabadi dialect are also produced and have been gaining popularity since 2005 . The city has also hosted international film festivals such as the International Children 's Film Festival and the Hyderabad International Film Festival . In 2005 , Guinness World Records declared Ramoji Film City to be the world 's largest film studio .
In 2004 the old Drake Circus shopping centre and Charles Cross car park were demolished and replaced by the latest Drake Circus Shopping Centre , which opened in October 2006 . It received negative feedback before opening when David Mackay said it was already " ten years out of date " . In contrast , the Theatre Royal 's production and education centre , TR2 , which was built on wasteland at Cattedown , was a runner-up for the RIBA Stirling Prize for Architecture in 2003 .
Throughout the history of the South Slavs , the vernacular , literary , and written languages ( e.g . Chakavian , Kajkavian , Shtokavian ) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently . Prior to the 19th century , they were collectively called " Illyric " , " Slavic " , " Slavonian " , " Bosnian " , " Dalmatian " , " Serbian " or " Croatian " . As such , the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824 , popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades , and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859 . At that time , Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires . Officially , the language was called variously Serbo-Croat , Croato-Serbian , Serbian and Croatian , Croatian and Serbian , Serbian or Croatian , Croatian or Serbian . Unofficially , Serbs and Croats typically called the language " Serbian " or " Croatian " , respectively , without implying a distinction between the two , and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina , " Bosnian " , " Croatian " , and " Serbian " were considered to be three names of a single official language . Croatian linguist Dalibor Brozović advocated the term Serbo-Croatian as late as 1988 , claiming that in an analogy with Indo-European , Serbo-Croatian does not only name the two components of the same language , but simply charts the limits of the region in which it is spoken and includes everything between the limits ( ‘Bosnian’ and ‘Montenegrin’ ) . Today , use of the term " Serbo-Croatian " is controversial due to the prejudice that nation and language must match . It is still used for lack of a succinct alternative , though alternative names have been used , such as Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian ( BCS ) , which is often seen in political contexts such as the Hague War Crimes tribunal .
The most impressive and famous of Sumerian buildings are the ziggurats , large layered platforms which supported temples . Sumerian cylinder seals also depict houses built from reeds not unlike those built by the Marsh Arabs of Southern Iraq until as recently as 400 CE . The Sumerians also developed the arch , which enabled them to develop a strong type of dome . They built this by constructing and linking several arches . Sumerian temples and palaces made use of more advanced materials and techniques , [ citation needed ] such as buttresses , recesses , half columns , and clay nails .
On 6 April 1941 , German forces , with Hungarian and Italian assistance , launched an invasion of Yugoslavia . On 10 April 1941 , Slavko Kvaternik proclaimed the Independent State of Croatia , and Tito responded by forming a Military Committee within the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party . Attacked from all sides , the armed forces of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia quickly crumbled . On 17 April 1941 , after King Peter II and other members of the government fled the country , the remaining representatives of the government and military met with the German officials in Belgrade . They quickly agreed to end military resistance . On 1 May 1941 , Tito issued a pamphlet calling on the people to unite in a battle against the occupation . On 27 June 1941 , the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia appointed Tito Commander in Chief of all project national liberation military forces . On 1 July 1941 , the Comintern sent precise instructions calling for immediate action .
However , Samoans greatly resented New Zealand 's colonial rule , and blamed inflation and the catastrophic 1918 flu epidemic on its misrule . By the late 1920s the resistance movement against colonial rule had gathered widespread support . One of the Mau leaders was Olaf Frederick Nelson , a half Samoan and half Swedish merchant . Nelson was eventually exiled during the late 1920s and early 1930s , but he continued to assist the organisation financially and politically . In accordance with the Mau 's non-violent philosophy , the newly elected leader , High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi , led his fellow uniformed Mau in a peaceful demonstration in downtown Apia on 28 December 1929 .
Baptist historian Bruce Gourley outlines four main views of Baptist origins : ( 1 ) The modern scholarly consensus that the movement traces its origin to the 17th century via the English Separatists , ( 2 ) the view that it was an outgrowth of Anabaptist traditions , ( 3 ) the perpetuity view which assumes that the Baptist faith and practice has existed since the time of Christ , and ( 4 ) the successionist view , or " Baptist successionism " , which argues that Baptist churches actually existed in an unbroken chain since the time of Christ .
The foundation has donated billions of dollars to help sufferers of AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria , protecting millions of children from death at the hands of preventable diseases . However , a 2007 investigation by The Los Angeles Times claimed there are three major unintended consequences with the foundation 's allocation of aid . First , sub-Saharan Africa already suffered from a shortage of primary doctors before the arrival of the Gates Foundation , but " by pouring most contributions into the fight against such high-profile killers as AIDS , Gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained , higher-paid clinicians , diverting staff from basic care " in sub-Saharan Africa . This " brain drain " adds to the existing doctor shortage and pulls away additional trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers . Second , " the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation " . Third , " Gates-funded vaccination programs have instructed caregivers to ignore – even discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations can not prevent " .

The Chinese intervention in late October 1950 bolstered the Korean People 's Air Force ( KPAF ) of North Korea with the MiG-15 , one of the world 's most advanced jet fighters . The fast , heavily armed MiG outflew first-generation UN jets such as the F-80 ( United States Air Force ) and Gloster Meteors ( Royal Australian Air Force ) , posing a real threat to B-29 Superfortress bombers even under fighter escort . Fearful of confronting the United States directly , the Soviet Union denied involvement of their personnel in anything other than an advisory role , but air combat quickly resulted in Soviet pilots dropping their code signals and speaking over the wireless in Russian . This known direct Soviet participation was a casus belli that the UN Command deliberately overlooked , lest the war for the Korean peninsula expand to include the Soviet Union , and potentially escalate into atomic warfare .
On 11 August , Barcelona started the 2015–16 season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating Sevilla FC 5–4 in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup . They ended the year with a 3–0 win over Argentine club River Plate in the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup Final on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time , with Suárez , Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament . The FIFA Club World Cup was Barcelona 's 20th international title , a record only matched by Egyptian club Al Ahly SC . By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions , Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year , breaking Real Madrid 's record of 178 goals scored in 2014 .
Countering Krugman , Peter J. Wallison wrote : " It is not true that every bubble—even a large bubble—has the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates . " Wallison notes that other developed countries had " large bubbles during the 1997–2007 period " but " the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the United States when the 1997–2007 [ bubble ] deflated . " According to Wallison , the reason the U.S. residential housing bubble ( as opposed to other types of bubbles ) led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loans – generally with low or no downpayments .
Phillips released " Home " as his coronation song , while Sanchez released " Change Nothing " . Phillips ' " Home " has since become the best selling of all coronation songs .
The tourism district would comprise several key areas in the city ; the Marina District , Ducktown , Chelsea , South Inlet , Bader Field , and Gardner 's Basin . Also included are 10 roadways that lead into the district , including several in the city 's northern end , or North Beach . Gardner 's Basin , which is home to the Atlantic City Aquarium , was initially left out of the tourism district , while a residential neighborhood in the Chelsea section was removed from the final boundaries , owing to complaints from the city . Also , the inclusion of Bader Field in the district was controversial and received much scrutiny from mayor Lorenzo Langford , who cast the lone " no " vote on the creation of the district citing its inclusion .
Since the 2010 election , the government has embarked on a series of reforms to direct the country towards liberal democracy , a mixed economy , and reconciliation , although doubts persist about the motives that underpin such reforms . The series of reforms includes the release of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest , the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission , the granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners , new labour laws that permit labour unions and strikes , a relaxation of press censorship , and the regulation of currency practices .
On August 5 , 2008 , SCA and Bertelsmann announced that Sony had agreed to acquire Bertelsmann 's 50 % stake in Sony BMG . Sony completed its acquisition of Bertelsmann 's 50 % stake in the companies ' joint venture on October 1 , 2008 . The company , once again named Sony Music Entertainment Inc. , became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Corporation through its US subsidiary SCA . The last few albums to feature a Sony BMG logo were Thriller 25 by Michael Jackson , I Am ... Sasha Fierce by Beyoncé , Keeps Gettin ' Better : A Decade of Hits by Christina Aguilera , and Safe Trip Home by Dido . A temporary logo was unveiled beginning December 1 , 2008 . The present logo was unveiled in March 2009 .
The brushless wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed ( BWRSDF ) machine is the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology ( i.e. , both ports independently excited with no short-circuited port ) . The dual ported transformer circuit topology is known to be unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set . If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set , the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable . Torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated .
According to the preamble in The Law of Treaties , treaties are a source of international law . If an act or lack thereof is condemned under international law , the act will not assume international legality even if approved by internal law . This means that in case of a conflict with domestic law , international law will always prevail .
According to the Office for National Statistics , at the 2001 census there were over a million black people in the United Kingdom ; 1 % of the total population described themselves as " Black Caribbean " , 0.8 % as " Black African " , and 0.2 % as " Black other " . Britain encouraged the immigration of workers from the Caribbean after World War II ; the first symbolic movement was those who came on the ship the Empire Windrush . The preferred official umbrella term is " black and minority ethnic " ( BME ) , but sometimes the term " black " is used on its own , to express unified opposition to racism , as in the Southall Black Sisters , which started with a mainly British Asian constituency , and the National Black Police Association , which has a membership of " African , African-Caribbean and Asian origin " .
In their attempt to ensure white supremacy decades after emancipation , in the early 20th century , most southern states created laws based on the one-drop rule , defining as black , persons with any known African ancestry . This was a stricter interpretation than what had prevailed in the 19th century ; it ignored the many mixed families in the state and went against commonly accepted social rules of judging a person by appearance and association . Some courts called it " the traceable amount rule . " Anthropologists called it an example of a hypodescent rule , meaning that racially mixed persons were assigned the status of the socially subordinate group .
Chapter VIII addresses the idea that species had special characteristics that prevented hybrids from being fertile in order to preserve separately created species . Darwin said that , far from being constant , the difficulty in producing hybrids of related species , and the viability and fertility of the hybrids , varied greatly , especially among plants . Sometimes what were widely considered to be separate species produced fertile hybrid offspring freely , and in other cases what were considered to be mere varieties of the same species could only be crossed with difficulty . Darwin concluded : " Finally , then , the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to , but even rather to support the view , that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties . "
In December , Beyoncé along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for " Demand A Plan " , a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 US mayors and others designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws , following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting . Beyoncé became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song " I Was Here " and its music video , shot in the UN , to the campaign . In 2013 , it was announced that Beyoncé would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci " Chime for Change " campaign that aims to spread female empowerment . The campaign , which aired on February 28 , was set to her new music . A concert for the cause took place on June 1 , 2013 in London and included other acts like Ellie Goulding , Florence and the Machine , and Rita Ora . In advance of the concert , she appeared in a campaign video released on 15 May 2013 , where she , along with Cameron Diaz , John Legend and Kylie Minogue , described inspiration from their mothers , while a number of other artists celebrated personal inspiration from other women , leading to a call for submission of photos of women of viewers ' inspiration from which a selection was shown at the concert . Beyoncé said about her mother Tina Knowles that her gift was " finding the best qualities in every human being . " With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult , visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls . Beyoncé is also taking part in " Miss a Meal " , a food-donation campaign , and supporting Goodwill charity through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S .
One example of omnidirectional antennas is the very common vertical antenna or whip antenna consisting of a metal rod ( often , but not always , a quarter of a wavelength long ) . A dipole antenna is similar but consists of two such conductors extending in opposite directions , with a total length that is often , but not always , a half of a wavelength long . Dipoles are typically oriented horizontally in which case they are weakly directional : signals are reasonably well radiated toward or received from all directions with the exception of the direction along the conductor itself ; this region is called the antenna blind cone or null .
In 2006 , Beyoncé introduced her all-female tour band Suga Mama ( also the name of a song in B'Day ) which includes bassists , drummers , guitarists , horn players , keyboardists and percussionists . Her background singers , The Mamas , consist of Montina Cooper-Donnell , Crystal Collins and Tiffany Moniqué Riddick . They made their debut appearance at the 2006 BET Awards and re-appeared in the music videos for " Irreplaceable " and " Green Light " . The band have supported Beyoncé in most subsequent live performances , including her 2007 concert tour The Beyoncé Experience , 2009–2010 I Am ... World Tour and 2013–2014 The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour .
In particle physics , this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of virtual particles which carry momentum , exchange by which and with real particles , is responsible for the creation of all known fundamental forces ( more accurately known as fundamental interactions ) . Virtual photons ( which are simply lowest quantum mechanical energy state of photons ) are also responsible for electrostatic interaction between electric charges ( which results in Coulomb law ) , for spontaneous radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states , for the Casimir force , for van der Waals bond forces and some other observable phenomena .
Under the millet system , non-Muslim people were considered subjects of the Empire , but were not subject to the Muslim faith or Muslim law . The Orthodox millet , for instance , was still officially legally subject to Justinian 's Code , which had been in effect in the Byzantine Empire for 900 years . Also , as the largest group of non-Muslim subjects ( or zimmi ) of the Islamic Ottoman state , the Orthodox millet was granted a number of special privileges in the fields of politics and commerce , and had to pay higher taxes than Muslim subjects .
Before emerging as a pop star , Madonna has spent her early years in rock music alongside her bands , Breakfast Club and Emmy . While performing with Emmy , Madonna recorded about 12-14 songs which resemble the punk rock of that period . Her early rock roots also can be found on the demo album Pre-Madonna . Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that with her self-titled debut album , Madonna began her career as a disco diva , in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of . In the beginning of the '80 's , disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop , and according to Erlewine , Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music . The album 's songs reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success , including a strong dance-based idiom , catchy hooks , highly polished arrangements and Madonna 's own vocal style . Her second album , Like a Virgin ( 1984 ) , foreshadowed several trends in her later works . It contained references to classical works ( pizzicato synthesizer line that opens " Angel " ) ; potential negative reaction from social groups ( " Dress You Up " was blacklisted by the Parents Music Resource Center ) ; and retro styles ( " Shoo-Bee-Doo " , Madonna 's homage to Motown ) .
After the death of Lysimachus , one of his officers , Philetaerus , took control of the city of Pergamum in 282 BC along with Lysimachus ' war chest of 9,000 talents and declared himself loyal to Seleucus I while remaining de facto independent . His descendant , Attalus I , defeated the invading Galatians and proclaimed himself an independent king . Attalus I ( 241–197BC ) , was a staunch ally of Rome against Philip V of Macedon during the first and second Macedonian Wars . For his support against the Seleucids in 190 BCE , Eumenes II was rewarded with all the former Seleucid domains in Asia Minor . Eumenes II turned Pergamon into a centre of culture and science by establishing the library of Pergamum which was said to be second only to the library of Alexandria with 200,000 volumes according to Plutarch . It included a reading room and a collection of paintings . Eumenes II also constructed the Pergamum Altar with friezes depicting the Gigantomachy on the acropolis of the city . Pergamum was also a center of parchment ( charta pergamena ) production . The Attalids ruled Pergamon until Attalus III bequeathed the kingdom to the Roman Republic in 133 BC to avoid a likely succession crisis .
Richmond city government consists of a city council with representatives from nine districts serving in a legislative and oversight capacity , as well as a popularly elected , at-large mayor serving as head of the executive branch . Citizens in each of the nine districts elect one council representative each to serve a four-year term . Beginning with the November 2008 election Council terms was lengthened to 4 years . The city council elects from among its members one member to serve as Council President and one to serve as Council Vice President . The city council meets at City Hall , located at 900 E. Broad St. , 2nd Floor , on the second and fourth Mondays of every month , except August .
The first years of the 14th century were marked by famines , culminating in the Great Famine of 1315–17 . The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age , which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures . The years 1313–14 and 1317–21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe , resulting in widespread crop failures . The climate change—which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century—was accompanied by an economic downturn .
In response to a given problem situation ( ) , a number of competing conjectures , or tentative theories ( ) , are systematically subjected to the most rigorous attempts at falsification possible . This process , error elimination ( ) , performs a similar function for science that natural selection performs for biological evolution . Theories that better survive the process of refutation are not more true , but rather , more " fit " —in other words , more applicable to the problem situation at hand ( ) . Consequently , just as a species ' biological fitness does not ensure continued survival , neither does rigorous testing protect a scientific theory from refutation in the future . Yet , as it appears that the engine of biological evolution has , over many generations , produced adaptive traits equipped to deal with more and more complex problems of survival , likewise , the evolution of theories through the scientific method may , in Popper 's view , reflect a certain type of progress : toward more and more interesting problems ( ) . For Popper , it is in the interplay between the tentative theories ( conjectures ) and error elimination ( refutation ) that scientific knowledge advances toward greater and greater problems ; in a process very much akin to the interplay between genetic variation and natural selection .
Certain bacteria form close spatial associations that are essential for their survival . One such mutualistic association , called interspecies hydrogen transfer , occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids , such as butyric acid or propionic acid , and produce hydrogen , and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen . The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings . Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow .
Several certification programs exist to support the professional aspirations of software testers and quality assurance specialists . No certification now offered actually requires the applicant to show their ability to test software . No certification is based on a widely accepted body of knowledge . This has led some to declare that the testing field is not ready for certification . Certification itself can not measure an individual 's productivity , their skill , or practical knowledge , and can not guarantee their competence , or professionalism as a tester .
Sugar taken orally reduces the total crying time but not the duration of the first cry in newborns undergoing a painful procedure ( a single lancing of the heel ) . It does not moderate the effect of pain on heart rate and a recent single study found that sugar did not significantly affect pain-related electrical activity in the brains of newborns one second after the heel lance procedure . Sweet oral liquid moderately reduces the incidence and duration of crying caused by immunization injection in children between one and twelve months of age .
In February 1939 , he received news from his sisters that his mother was dying . On 10 February 1939 , Pope Pius XI died . Roncalli was unable to see his mother for the end as the death of a pontiff meant that he would have to stay at his post until the election of a new pontiff . Unfortunately , she died on 20 February 1939 , during the nine days of mourning for the late Pius XI . He was sent a letter by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli , and Roncalli later recalled that it was probably the last letter Pacelli sent until his election as Pope Pius XII on 2 March 1939 . Roncalli expressed happiness that Pacelli was elected , and , on radio , listened to the coronation of the new pontiff .
In Greece Carnival is also known as the Apokriés ( Greek : Αποκριές , " saying goodbye to meat " ) , or the season of the " Opening of the Triodion " , so named after the liturgical book used by the church from then until Holy Week . One of the season 's high points is Tsiknopempti , when celebrants enjoy roast beef dinners ; the ritual is repeated the following Sunday . The following week , the last before Lent , is called Tyrinē ( Greek : Τυρινή , " cheese [ week ] " ) because meat is forbidden , although dairy products are not . Lent begins on " Clean Monday " , the day after " Cheese Sunday " . Throughout the Carnival season , people disguise themselves as maskarádes ( " masqueraders " ) and engage in pranks and revelry .
Before the attack on Pearl Harbor , the 800,000-member America First Committee vehemently opposed any American intervention in the European conflict , even as America sold military aid to Britain and the Soviet Union through the Lend-Lease program . Opposition to war in the U.S. vanished after the attack . On 8 December , the United States , the United Kingdom , Canada , and the Netherlands declared war on Japan , followed by China and Australia the next day . Four days after Pearl Harbor , Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declared war on the United States , drawing the country into a two-theater war . This is widely agreed to be a grand strategic blunder , as it abrogated the benefit Germany gained by Japan 's distraction of the U.S. ( predicted months before in a memo by Commander Arthur McCollum ) [ nb 12 ] and the reduction in aid to Britain , which both Congress and Hitler had managed to avoid during over a year of mutual provocation , which would otherwise have resulted .
During the Cenozoic era , specifically about 25 million years ago during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs , the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands . Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread . The grasslands provided a new niche for mammals , including many ungulates and glires , that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets . Traditionally , the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked . However , an examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open , gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes in mammals , giving rise to the " grit , not grass " hypothesis .
In 1928 , Nasser went to Alexandria to live with his maternal grandfather and attend the city 's Attarin elementary school . He left in 1929 for a private boarding school in Helwan , and later returned to Alexandria to enter the Ras el-Tin secondary school and to join his father , who was working for the city 's postal service . It was in Alexandria that Nasser became involved in political activism . After witnessing clashes between protesters and police in Manshia Square , he joined the demonstration without being aware of its purpose . The protest , organized by the ultranationalist Young Egypt Society , called for the end of colonialism in Egypt in the wake of the 1923 Egyptian constitution 's annulment by Prime Minister Isma'il Sidqi . Nasser was arrested and detained for a night before his father bailed him out .
But Amnesty International found no evidence that UNFPA had supported the coercion . A 2001 study conducted by the pro-life Population Research Institute ( PRI ) falsely claimed that the UNFPA shared an office with the Chinese family planning officials who were carrying out forced abortions . " We located the family planning offices , and in that family planning office , we located the UNFPA office , and we confirmed from family planning officials there that there is no distinction between what the UNFPA does and what the Chinese Family Planning Office does , " said Scott Weinberg , a spokesman for PRI . However , United Nations Members disagreed and approved UNFPA’s new country program me in January 2006 . The more than 130 members of the “Group of 77” developing countries in the United Nations expressed support for the UNFPA programmes . In addition , speaking for European democracies -- Norway , Denmark , Sweden , Finland , the Netherlands , France , Belgium , Switzerland and Germany -- the United Kingdom stated , ”UNFPA’s activities in China , as in the rest of the world , are in strict conformity with the unanimously adopted Programme of Action of the ICPD , and play a key role in supporting our common endeavor , the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.”
As a result of continued warming , the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert . In Eastern Antarctica , seed ferns or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time . Synapsids , commonly known as " mammal-like reptiles " , were common in Antarctica during the Early Triassic and included forms such as Lystrosaurus . The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the Jurassic period ( 206–146 Ma ) , and islands gradually rose out of the ocean . Ginkgo trees , conifers , bennettites , horsetails , ferns and cycads were plentiful during this period . In West Antarctica , coniferous forests dominated through the entire Cretaceous period ( 146–66 Ma ) , though southern beech became more prominent towards the end of this period . Ammonites were common in the seas around Antarctica , and dinosaurs were also present , though only three Antarctic dinosaur genera ( Cryolophosaurus and Glacialisaurus , from the Hanson Formation , and Antarctopelta ) have been described to date . It was during this era that Gondwana began to break up .
The writers of Grub Street , the Grub Street Hacks , were left feeling bitter about the relative success of the men of letters , and found an outlet for their literature which was typified by the libelle . Written mostly in the form of pamphlets , the libelles " slandered the court , the Church , the aristocracy , the academies , the salons , everything elevated and respectable , including the monarchy itself " . Le Gazetier cuirassé by Charles Théveneau de Morande was a prototype of the genre . It was Grub Street literature that was most read by the public during the Enlightenment . More importantly , according to Darnton , the Grub Street hacks inherited the " revolutionary spirit " once displayed by the philosophes , and paved the way for the French Revolution by desacralizing figures of political , moral and religious authority in France .
Many of Yale 's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931 , financed largely by Edward S. Harkness Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities such as a writer , an athlete , a tea-drinking socialite , and a student who has fallen asleep while reading . Similarly , the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute ( on the wall of the Law School ) , or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette . The architect , James Gamble Rogers , faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid , deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages , and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages . In fact , the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture , for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner , most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930 . One exception is Harkness Tower , 216 feet ( 66 m ) tall , which was originally a free-standing stone structure . It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon .
The son of an impoverished Bedouin goat herder , Gaddafi became involved in politics while at school in Sabha , subsequently enrolling in the Royal Military Academy , Benghazi . Founding a revolutionary cell within the military , in 1969 they seized power from the absolute monarchy of King Idris in a bloodless coup . Becoming Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council ( RCC ) , Gaddafi abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic . Ruling by decree , he implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya , and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments . Intent on pushing Libya towards " Islamic socialism " , he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system and nationalized the oil industry , using the increased revenues to bolster the military , implement social programs and fund revolutionary militants across the world . In 1973 he initiated a " Popular Revolution " with the formation of General People 's Committees ( GPCs ) , purported to be a system of direct democracy , but retained personal control over major decisions . He outlined his Third International Theory that year , publishing these ideas in The Green Book .
The Aeronautics Branch was renamed the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1934 to reflect its enhanced status within the Department . As commercial flying increased , the Bureau encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers for providing air traffic control ( ATC ) along the airways . In 1936 , the Bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the ATC system . The pioneer air traffic controllers used maps , blackboards , and mental calculations to ensure the safe separation of aircraft traveling along designated routes between cities .
Since playing Pong while filming Jaws in 1974 , Spielberg has been an avid video gamer . Spielberg played many of LucasArts adventure games , including the first Monkey Island games . He owns a Wii , a PlayStation 3 , a PSP , and Xbox 360 , and enjoys playing first-person shooters such as the Medal of Honor series and Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare . He has also criticized the use of cut scenes in games , calling them intrusive , and feels making story flow naturally into the gameplay is a challenge for future game developers .
Estonian ( eesti keel [ ˈeːsti ˈkeːl ] ( listen ) ) is the official language of Estonia , spoken natively by about 1.1 million people in Estonia and tens of thousands in various migrant communities . It belongs to the Finnic branch of the Uralic language family .
New or " virgin " heavy/heavyweight ( 180–220 g ) vinyl is commonly used for modern audiophile vinyl releases in all genres . Many collectors prefer to have heavyweight vinyl albums , which have been reported to have better sound than normal vinyl because of their higher tolerance against deformation caused by normal play . 180 g vinyl is more expensive to produce only because it uses more vinyl . Manufacturing processes are identical regardless of weight . In fact , pressing lightweight records requires more care . An exception is the propensity of 200 g pressings to be slightly more prone to non-fill , when the vinyl biscuit does not sufficiently fill a deep groove during pressing ( percussion or vocal amplitude changes are the usual locations of these artifacts ) . This flaw causes a grinding or scratching sound at the non-fill point .
Child labour is still common in many parts of the world . Estimates for child labour vary . It ranges between 250 and 304 million , if children aged 5–17 involved in any economic activity are counted . If light occasional work is excluded , ILO estimates there were 153 million child labourers aged 5–14 worldwide in 2008 . This is about 20 million less than ILO estimate for child labourers in 2004 . Some 60 percent of the child labour was involved in agricultural activities such as farming , dairy , fisheries and forestry . Another 25 percent of child labourers were in service activities such as retail , hawking goods , restaurants , load and transfer of goods , storage , picking and recycling trash , polishing shoes , domestic help , and other services . The remaining 15 percent laboured in assembly and manufacturing in informal economy , home-based enterprises , factories , mines , packaging salt , operating machinery , and such operations . Two out of three child workers work alongside their parents , in unpaid family work situations . Some children work as guides for tourists , sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants . Child labour predominantly occurs in the rural areas ( 70 % ) and informal urban sector ( 26 % ) .
Jim Foster , a promotions manager with the National Football League , conceived of indoor football while watching an indoor soccer match at Madison Square Garden in 1981 . While at the game , he wrote his idea on a 9x12 envelope , with sketches of the field and notes on gameplay . He presented the idea to a few friends at the NFL offices , where he received praise and encouragement for his concept . After solidifying the rules and a business plan , and supplemented with sketches by a professional artist , Foster presented his idea to various television networks . He reached an agreement with NBC for a " test game " .
Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture and from general purpose computers . They often feature thousands of CPUs , customized high-speed interconnects , and specialized computing hardware . Such designs tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once . Supercomputers usually see usage in large-scale simulation , graphics rendering , and cryptography applications , as well as with other so-called " embarrassingly parallel " tasks .
Although its PlayStation predecessors had been very dominant against the competition and were hugely profitable for Sony , PlayStation 3 had an inauspicious start , and Sony chairman and CEO Sir Howard Stringer initially could not convince investors of a turnaround in its fortunes . The PS3 lacked the unique gameplay of the more affordable Wii which became that generation 's most successful console in terms of units sold . Furthermore , PS3 had to compete directly with Xbox 360 which had a market head start , and as a result the platform no longer had exclusive titles that the PS2 enjoyed such as the Grand Theft Auto and Final Fantasy series ( regarding cross-platform games , Xbox 360 versions were generally considered superior in 2006 , although by 2008 the PS3 versions had reached parity or surpassed ) , and it took longer than expected for PS3 to enjoy strong sales and close the gap with Xbox 360 . Sony also continued to lose money on each PS3 sold through 2010 , although the redesigned " slim " PS3 has cut these losses since then .
Music is cherished in Boston . The Boston Symphony Orchestra is one of the " Big Five , " a group of the greatest American orchestras , and the classical music magazine Gramophone called it one of the " world 's best " orchestras . Symphony Hall ( located west of Back Bay ) is home to the Boston Symphony Orchestra , ( and the related Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra , which is the largest youth orchestra in the nation ) and the Boston Pops Orchestra . The British newspaper The Guardian called Boston Symphony Hall " one of the top venues for classical music in the world , " adding that " Symphony Hall in Boston was where science became an essential part of concert hall design . " Other concerts are held at the New England Conservatory 's Jordan Hall . The Boston Ballet performs at the Boston Opera House . Other performing-arts organizations located in the city include the Boston Lyric Opera Company , Opera Boston , Boston Baroque ( the first permanent Baroque orchestra in the US ) , and the Handel and Haydn Society ( one of the oldest choral companies in the United States ) . The city is a center for contemporary classical music with a number of performing groups , several of which are associated with the city 's conservatories and universities . These include the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Boston Musica Viva . Several theaters are located in or near the Theater District south of Boston Common , including the Cutler Majestic Theatre , Citi Performing Arts Center , the Colonial Theater , and the Orpheum Theatre .
In the 20th century after decades of intense warfare and political turmoil terms such as " Near East " , " Far East " and " Middle East " were relegated to the experts , especially in the new field of political science . The new wave of diplomats often came from those programs . Archaeology on the international scene , although very much of intellectual interest to the major universities , fell into the shadow of international relations . Their domain became the Ancient Near East , which could no longer be relied upon to be the Near East . The Ottoman Empire was gone , along with all the other empires of the 19th century , replaced with independent republics . Someone had to reconcile the present with the past . This duty was inherited by various specialized agencies that were formed to handle specific aspects of international relations , now so complex as to be beyond the scope and abilities of a diplomatic corps in the former sense . The ancient Near East is frozen in time . The living Near East is primarily what the agencies say it is . In most cases this single term is inadequate to describe the geographical range of their operations . The result is multiple definitions .
In 1972 , Walter Fiers and his team at the University of Ghent were the first to determine the sequence of a gene : the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 coat protein . The subsequent development of chain-termination DNA sequencing in 1977 by Frederick Sanger improved the efficiency of sequencing and turned it into a routine laboratory tool . An automated version of the Sanger method was used in early phases of the Human Genome Project .
Glaciers are present on every continent and approximately fifty countries , excluding those ( Australia , South Africa ) that have glaciers only on distant subantarctic island territories . Extensive glaciers are found in Antarctica , Chile , Canada , Alaska , Greenland and Iceland . Mountain glaciers are widespread , especially in the Andes , the Himalayas , the Rocky Mountains , the Caucasus , and the Alps . Mainland Australia currently contains no glaciers , although a small glacier on Mount Kosciuszko was present in the last glacial period . In New Guinea , small , rapidly diminishing , glaciers are located on its highest summit massif of Puncak Jaya . Africa has glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania , on Mount Kenya and in the Rwenzori Mountains . Oceanic islands with glaciers occur on Iceland , Svalbard , New Zealand , Jan Mayen and the subantarctic islands of Marion , Heard , Grande Terre ( Kerguelen ) and Bouvet . During glacial periods of the Quaternary , Taiwan , Hawaii on Mauna Kea and Tenerife also had large alpine glaciers , while the Faroe and Crozet Islands were completely glaciated .
Saint Helena was first settled by the English in 1659 , and the island has a population of about 4,250 inhabitants , mainly descended from people from Britain – settlers ( " planters " ) and soldiers – and slaves who were brought there from the beginning of settlement – initially from Africa ( the Cape Verde Islands , Gold Coast and west coast of Africa are mentioned in early records ) , then India and Madagascar . Eventually the planters felt there were too many slaves and no more were imported after 1792 .
Hogeschool is used in Belgium and in the Netherlands . The hogeschool has many similarities to the Fachhochschule in the German language areas and to the ammattikorkeakoulu in Finland .
New York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world by the diplomatic consulates of Iceland and Latvia and by New York 's Baruch College . A book containing a series of essays titled New York , culture capital of the world , 1940–1965 has also been published as showcased by the National Library of Australia . In describing New York , author Tom Wolfe said , " Culture just seems to be in the air , like part of the weather . "
After World War II , eastern European countries such as the Soviet Union , Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Romania and Yugoslavia expelled the Germans from their territories . Many of those had inhabited these lands for centuries , developing a unique culture . Germans were also forced to leave the former eastern territories of Germany , which were annexed by Poland ( Silesia , Pomerania , parts of Brandenburg and southern part of East Prussia ) and the Soviet Union ( northern part of East Prussia ) . Between 12 and 16,5 million ethnic Germans and German citizens were expelled westwards to allied-occupied Germany .
The islands were first sighted in 1506 by Portuguese explorer Tristão da Cunha ; rough seas prevented a landing . He named the main island after himself , Ilha de Tristão da Cunha , which was anglicised from its earliest mention on British Admiralty charts to Tristan da Cunha Island . Some sources state that the Portuguese made the first landing in 1520 , when the Lás Rafael captained by Ruy Vaz Pereira called at Tristan for water . The first undisputed landing was made in 1643 by the crew of the Heemstede , captained by Claes Gerritsz Bierenbroodspot .
Since Whitehead 's metaphysics described a universe in which all entities experience , he needed a new way of describing perception that was not limited to living , self-conscious beings . The term he coined was " prehension " , which comes from the Latin prehensio , meaning " to seize . " The term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious , applying to people as well as electrons . It is also intended to make clear Whitehead 's rejection of the theory of representative perception , in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities . For Whitehead , the term " prehension " indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself . In this way , entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations , rather than being independent of them . Further , Whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes , causal efficacy ( or " physical prehension " ) and presentational immediacy ( or " conceptual prehension " ) .

Mexico City remains the only Latin American city to host the Olympic Games , having held the Summer Olympics in 1968 , winning bids against Buenos Aires , Lyon and Detroit . ( This too will change thanks to Rio , 2016 Summer Games host ) . The city hosted the 1955 and 1975 Pan American Games , the last after Santiago and São Paulo withdrew . The ICF Flatwater Racing World Championships were hosted here in 1974 and 1994 . Lucha libre is a Mexican style of wrestling , and is one of the more popular sports throughout the country . The main venues in the city are Arena México and Arena Coliseo .
Also in 1931 , Hayek critiqued Keynes 's Treatise on Money ( 1930 ) in his " Reflections on the pure theory of Mr. J. M. Keynes " and published his lectures at the LSE in book form as Prices and Production . Unemployment and idle resources are , for Keynes , caused by a lack of effective demand ; for Hayek , they stem from a previous , unsustainable episode of easy money and artificially low interest rates . Keynes asked his friend Piero Sraffa to respond . Sraffa elaborated on the effect of inflation-induced " forced savings " on the capital sector and about the definition of a " natural " interest rate in a growing economy . Others who responded negatively to Hayek 's work on the business cycle included John Hicks , Frank Knight , and Gunnar Myrdal . Kaldor later wrote that Hayek 's Prices and Production had produced " a remarkable crop of critics " and that the total number of pages in British and American journals dedicated to the resulting debate " could rarely have been equalled in the economic controversies of the past . "
According to a 2011 projection by the International Energy Agency , solar power plants may produce most of the world 's electricity within 50 years , significantly reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment . The IEA has said : " Photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world 's demand for electricity by 2060 – and half of all energy needs – with wind , hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation " . " Photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity " .

London is home to many museums , galleries , and other institutions , many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role . The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury , in 1753 . Originally containing antiquities , natural history specimens and the national library , the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe . In 1824 the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings ; this now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square .
Pluralistic idealism such as that of Gottfried Leibniz takes the view that there are many individual minds that together underlie the existence of the observed world and make possible the existence of the physical universe . Unlike absolute idealism , pluralistic idealism does not assume the existence of a single ultimate mental reality or " Absolute " . Leibniz ' form of idealism , known as Panpsychism , views " monads " as the true atoms of the universe and as entities having perception . The monads are " substantial forms of being " , elemental , individual , subject to their own laws , non-interacting , each reflecting the entire universe . Monads are centers of force , which is substance while space , matter and motion are phenomenal and their form and existence is dependent on the simple and immaterial monads . There is a pre-established harmony established by God , the central monad , between the world in the minds of the monads and the external world of objects . Leibniz 's cosmology embraced traditional Christian Theism . The English psychologist and philosopher James Ward inspired by Leibniz had also defended a form of pluralistic idealism . According to Ward the universe is composed of " psychic monads " of different levels , interacting for mutual self- betterment .
Fighting on one side was a coalition of forces including the Republic of Vietnam ( South Vietnam or the " RVN " ) , the United States , supplemented by South Korea , Thailand , Australia , New Zealand , and the Philippines . The allies fought against the North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ) as well as the National Liberation Front ( NLF , also known as Viet communists Viet Cong ) , or " VC " , a guerrilla force within South Vietnam . The NVA received substantial military and economic aid from the Soviet Union and China , turning Vietnam into a proxy war .
Over time , Roman architecture was modified as their urban requirements changed , and the civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined . The Roman concrete has remained a riddle , and even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently . The architectural style of the capital city was emulated by other urban centers under Roman control and influence . Roman cities were well planned , efficiently managed and neatly maintained .

Some independent stereo manufacturers including JVC , Pioneer , Kenwood , Alpine , Sony , and Harman Kardon also have iPod-specific integration solutions . Alternative connection methods include adapter kits ( that use the cassette deck or the CD changer port ) , audio input jacks , and FM transmitters such as the iTrip—although personal FM transmitters are illegal in some countries . Many car manufacturers have added audio input jacks as standard .
Laird writes that the Ming appointed titles to eastern Tibetan princes , and that " these alliances with eastern Tibetan principalities are the evidence China now produces for its assertion that the Ming ruled Tibet , " despite the fact that the Ming did not send an army to replace the Mongols after they left Tibet . Yiu Yung-chin states that the furthest western extent of the Ming dynasty 's territory was Gansu , Sichuan , and Yunnan while " the Ming did not possess Tibet . "
One of the best known sporting events in the city is the Boston Marathon , the 26.2-mile ( 42.2 km ) race which is the world 's oldest annual marathon , run on Patriots ' Day in April . On April 15 , 2013 , two explosions killed three people and injured hundreds at the marathon . Another major annual event is the Head of the Charles Regatta , held in October .
When the Central Junta fell to the French , numerous new Juntas appeared all across the Americas , eventually resulting in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south , to Mexico in the north . After the death of the king Ferdinand VII , in 1833 , only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule , until the Spanish–American War in 1898 . Unlike the Spanish , the Portuguese did not divide their colonial territory in America . The captaincies they created were subdued to a centralized administration in Salvador ( later relocated to Rio de Janeiro ) which reported directly to the Portuguese Crown until its independence in 1822 , becoming the Empire of Brazil .
In 1963 , Egyptian director Youssef Chahine produced the film El Nasser Salah El Dine ( " Saladin The Victorious " ) , which intentionally drew parallels between Saladin , considered a hero in the Arab world , and Nasser and his pan-Arabist policies . Nasser is played by Ahmed Zaki in Mohamed Fadel 's 1996 Nasser 56 . The film set the Egyptian box office record at the time , and focused on Nasser during the Suez Crisis . It is also considered a milestone in Egyptian and Arab cinema as the first film to dramatize the role of a modern-day Arab leader . Together with the 1999 Syrian biopic Gamal Abdel Nasser , the films marked the first biographical movies about contemporary public figures produced in the Arab world .

In 1853 , Victoria gave birth to her eighth child , Leopold , with the aid of the new anaesthetic , chloroform . Victoria was so impressed by the relief it gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of her ninth and final child , Beatrice , despite opposition from members of the clergy , who considered it against biblical teaching , and members of the medical profession , who thought it dangerous . Victoria may have suffered from post-natal depression after many of her pregnancies . Letters from Albert to Victoria intermittently complain of her loss of self-control . For example , about a month after Leopold 's birth Albert complained in a letter to Victoria about her " continuance of hysterics " over a " miserable trifle " .
Oklahoma City is on the I-35 Corridor and is one of the primary travel corridors into neighboring Texas and Mexico . Located in the Frontier Country region of the state , the city 's northeast section lies in an ecological region known as the Cross Timbers . The city was founded during the Land Run of 1889 , and grew to a population of over 10,000 within hours of its founding . The city was the scene of the April 19 , 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building , in which 168 people died . It was the deadliest terror attack in the history of the United States until the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , and remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history .
For " closed systems " with no external source or sink of energy , the first law of thermodynamics states that a system 's energy is constant unless energy is transferred in or out by mechanical work or heat , and that no energy is lost in transfer . This means that it is impossible to create or destroy energy . While heat can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas , for cyclic processes of practical interest in heat engines the second law of thermodynamics states that the system doing work always loses some energy as waste heat . This creates a limit to the amount of heat energy that can do work in a cyclic process , a limit called the available energy . Mechanical and other forms of energy can be transformed in the other direction into thermal energy without such limitations . The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up all forms of energy in the system .
In early 2009 , Spielberg shot the first film in a planned trilogy of motion capture films based on The Adventures of Tintin , written by Belgian artist Hergé , with Peter Jackson . The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn , was not released until October 2011 , due to the complexity of the computer animation involved . The world premiere took place on October 22 , 2011 in Brussels , Belgium . The film was released in North American theaters on December 21 , 2011 , in Digital 3D and IMAX . It received generally positive reviews from critics , and grossed over $ 373 million worldwide . The Adventures of Tintin won the award for Best Animated Feature Film at the Golden Globe Awards that year . It is the first non-Pixar film to win the award since the category was first introduced . Jackson has been announced to direct the second film .
In June 2006 , Steven Spielberg announced he would direct a scientifically accurate film about " a group of explorers who travel through a worm hole and into another dimension " , from a treatment by Kip Thorne and producer Lynda Obst . In January 2007 , screenwriter Jonathan Nolan met with them to discuss adapting Obst and Thorne 's treatment into a narrative screenplay . The screenwriter suggested the addition of a " time element " to the treatment 's basic idea , which was welcomed by Obst and Thorne . In March of that year , Paramount hired Nolan , as well as scientists from Caltech , forming a workshop to adapt the treatment under the title Interstellar . The following July , Kip Thorne said there was a push by people for him to portray himself in the film . Spielberg later abandoned Interstellar , which was eventually directed by Christopher Nolan .
The Ming initiated sporadic armed intervention in Tibet during the 14th century , but did not garrison permanent troops there . At times the Tibetans also used armed resistance against Ming forays . The Wanli Emperor ( r. 1572–1620 ) made attempts to reestablish Sino-Tibetan relations after the Mongol-Tibetan alliance initiated in 1578 , which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent Qing dynasty ( 1644–1912 ) of China in their support for the Dalai Lama of the Gelug school . By the late 16th century , the Mongols were successful armed protectors of the Gelug Dalai Lama , after increasing their presence in the Amdo region . This culminated in Güshi Khan 's ( 1582–1655 ) conquest of Tibet from 1637–1642 and the establishment of the Ganden Phodrang regime by the 5th Dalai Lama with his help .
For centuries , various peoples in modern-day Nigeria traded overland with traders from North Africa . Cities in the area became regional centres in a broad network of trade routes that spanned western , central and northern Africa . In the 16th century , Spanish and Portuguese explorers were the first Europeans to begin significant , direct trade with peoples of modern-day Nigeria , at the port they named Lagos and in Calabar . Europeans traded goods with peoples at the coast ; coastal trade with Europeans also marked the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade . The port of Calabar on the historical Bight of Biafra ( now commonly referred to as the Bight of Bonny ) become one of the largest slave trading posts in West Africa in the era of the transatlantic slave trade . Other major slaving ports in Nigeria were located in Badagry , Lagos on the Bight of Benin and on Bonny Island on the Bight of Biafra . The majority of those enslaved and taken to these ports were captured in raids and wars . Usually the captives were taken back to the conquerors ' territory as forced labour ; after time , they were sometimes acculturated and absorbed into the conquerors ' society . A number of slave routes were established throughout Nigeria linking the hinterland areas with the major coastal ports . Some of the more prolific slave traders were linked with the Oyo Empire in the southwest , the Aro Confederacy in the southeast and the Sokoto Caliphate in the north .
The first Confederate soldier to be killed in the Civil War was Private Henry Wyatt from North Carolina , in the Battle of Big Bethel in June 1861 . At the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863 , the 26th North Carolina Regiment participated in Pickett/Pettigrew 's Charge and advanced the farthest into the Northern lines of any Confederate regiment . During the Battle of Chickamauga , the 58th North Carolina Regiment advanced farther than any other regiment on Snodgrass Hill to push back the remaining Union forces from the battlefield . At Appomattox Court House in Virginia in April 1865 , the 75th North Carolina Regiment , a cavalry unit , fired the last shots of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in the Civil War . For many years , North Carolinians proudly boasted that they had been " First at Bethel , Farthest at Gettysburg and Chickamauga , and Last at Appomattox . "
Others have argued that excessive regulation suppresses therapeutic innovation , and that the current cost of regulator-required clinical trials prevents the full exploitation of new genetic and biological knowledge for the treatment of human disease . A 2012 report by the President 's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology made several key recommendations to reduce regulatory burdens to new drug development , including 1 ) expanding the FDA 's use of accelerated approval processes , 2 ) creating an expedited approval pathway for drugs intended for use in narrowly defined populations , and 3 ) undertaking pilot projects designed to evaluate the feasibility of a new , adaptive drug approval process .
The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Florida was 20,271,272 on July 1 , 2015 , a 7.82 % increase since the 2010 United States Census . The population of Florida in the 2010 census was 18,801,310 . Florida was the seventh fastest-growing state in the U.S. in the 12-month period ending July 1 , 2012 . In 2010 , the center of population of Florida was located between Fort Meade and Frostproof . The center of population has moved less than 5 miles ( 8 km ) to the east and approximately 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) to the north between 1980 and 2010 and has been located in Polk County since the 1960 census . The population exceeded 19.7 million by December 2014 , surpassing the population of the state of New York for the first time .
After the American Revolutionary War , the number and proportion of free people of color increased markedly in the North and the South as slaves were freed . Most northern states abolished slavery , sometimes , like New York , in programs of gradual emancipation that took more than two decades to be completed . The last slaves in New York were not freed until 1827 . In connection with the Second Great Awakening , Quaker and Methodist preachers in the South urged slaveholders to free their slaves . Revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves , some by deed and others by will , so that from 1782 to 1810 , the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the South .
Classical immunology ties in with the fields of epidemiology and medicine . It studies the relationship between the body systems , pathogens , and immunity . The earliest written mention of immunity can be traced back to the plague of Athens in 430 BCE . Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time . Many other ancient societies have references to this phenomenon , but it was not until the 19th and 20th centuries before the concept developed into scientific theory .
Having small population size is a characteristic almost universally inherent to apex predators , humans and dogs by far the most blatant exceptions . Low numbers would n't be a problem for apex predators if there was an abundance of prey and no competition or niche overlap , a scenario that is rarely , if ever , encountered in the wild . The competitive exclusion principle states that if two species ' ecological niches overlap , there is a very high likelihood of competition as both species are in direct competition for the same resources . This factor alone could lead to the extirpation of one or both species , but is compounded by the added factor of prey abundance .
The prevalence of HIV-infection among the adult population is 1.8 % . Only 20 % of infected pregnant women receive anti retroviral coverage to prevent transmission to newborns .
Two groups G and H are called isomorphic if there exist group homomorphisms a : G → H and b : H → G , such that applying the two functions one after another in each of the two possible orders gives the identity functions of G and H. That is , a ( b ( h ) ) = h and b ( a ( g ) ) = g for any g in G and h in H. From an abstract point of view , isomorphic groups carry the same information . For example , proving that g • g = 1G for some element g of G is equivalent to proving that a ( g ) ∗ a ( g ) = 1H , because applying a to the first equality yields the second , and applying b to the second gives back the first .
The complete technical disclosure of the Columbia LP by Peter C. Goldmark , Rene ' Snepvangers and William S. Bachman in 1949 made it possible for a great variety of record companies to get into the business of making long playing records . The business grew quickly and interest spread in high fidelity sound and the do-it-yourself market for pickups , turntables , amplifier kits , loudspeaker enclosure plans , and AM/FM radio tuners . The LP record for longer works , 45 rpm for pop music , and FM radio became high fidelity program sources in demand . Radio listeners heard recordings broadcast and this in turn generated more record sales . The industry flourished .
Relations between Ashkenazim and Sephardim have not always been warm . North African Sepharadim and Berber Jews were often looked upon by Ashkenazim as second-class citizens during the first decade after the creation of Israel . This has led to protest movements such as the Israeli Black Panthers led by Saadia Marciano a Moroccan Jew . Nowadays , relations are getting better . In some instances , Ashkenazi communities have accepted significant numbers of Sephardi newcomers , sometimes resulting in intermarriage .
Beyoncé and husband Jay Z are friends with President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama . She performed " America the Beautiful " at the 2009 presidential inauguration , as well as " At Last " during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later . Beyoncé and Jay Z held a fundraiser at the latter 's 40/40 Club in Manhattan for Obama 's 2012 presidential campaign which raised $ 4 million . Beyoncé uploaded pictures of her paper ballot on Tumblr , confirming she had voted in support for the Democratic Party and to encourage others to do so . She also performed the American national anthem at his second inauguration , singing along with a pre-recorded track . She publicly endorsed same sex marriage on March 26 , 2013 , after the Supreme Court debate on California 's Proposition 8 . In July 2013 , Beyoncé and Jay-Z attended a rally in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting of Trayvon Martin .
Cambridge English Dictionary states that culture is , " the way of life , especially the general customs and beliefs , of a particular group of people at a particular time . " Terror Management Theory posits that culture is a series of activities and worldviews that provide humans with the illusion of being individuals of value in a world meaning—raising themselves above the merely physical aspects of existence , in order to deny the animal insignificance and death that Homo Sapiens became aware of when they acquired a larger brain .
The Battle of Wörth ( also known as Fröschwiller or Reichshoffen ) began when the two armies clashed again on 6 August near Wörth in the town of Fröschwiller , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from Wissembourg . The Crown Prince of Prussia 's 3rd army had , on the quick reaction of his Chief of Staff General von Blumenthal , drawn reinforcements which brought its strength up to 140,000 troops . The French had been slowly reinforced and their force numbered only 35,000 . Although badly outnumbered , the French defended their position just outside Fröschwiller . By afternoon , the Germans had suffered c. 10,500 killed or wounded and the French had lost a similar number of casualties and another c. 9,200 men taken prisoner , a loss of about 50 % . The Germans captured Fröschwiller which sat on a hilltop in the centre of the French line . Having lost any hope for victory and facing a massacre , the French army disengaged and retreated in a westerly direction towards Bitche and Saverne , hoping to join French forces on the other side of the Vosges mountains . The German 3rd army did not pursue the French but remained in Alsace and moved slowly south , attacking and destroying the French garrisons in the vicinity .
Theravadin Buddhists believe that personal effort is required to realize rebirth . Monks follow the vinaya : meditating , teaching and serving their lay communities . Laypersons can perform good actions , producing merit .
On November 12 , the league announced the defending champion San Jose SaberCats would be ceasing operations due to " reasons unrelated to League operations " . A statement from the league indicated that the AFL is working to secure new , long-term owners for the franchise . This leaves the AFL with eight teams for 2016 .
Publius Vergilius Maro ( Classical Latin : [ ˈpuː.blɪ.ʊs wɛrˈɡɪ.lɪ.ʊs ˈma.roː ] ; October 15 , 70 BC – September 21 , 19 BC ) , usually called Virgil or Vergil /ˈvɜːrdʒᵻl/ in English , was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period . He is known for three major works of Latin literature , the Eclogues ( or Bucolics ) , the Georgics , and the epic Aeneid . A number of minor poems , collected in the Appendix Vergiliana , are sometimes attributed to him .
Seattle annually sends a team of spoken word slammers to the National Poetry Slam and considers itself home to such performance poets as Buddy Wakefield , two-time Individual World Poetry Slam Champ ; Anis Mojgani , two-time National Poetry Slam Champ ; and Danny Sherrard , 2007 National Poetry Slam Champ and 2008 Individual World Poetry Slam Champ . Seattle also hosted the 2001 national Poetry Slam Tournament . The Seattle Poetry Festival is a biennial poetry festival that ( launched first as the Poetry Circus in 1997 ) has featured local , regional , national , and international names in poetry .
After the Peace of Westphalia , several border territories were assigned to the United Provinces . They were federally-governed Generality Lands ( Generaliteitslanden ) . They were Staats-Brabant ( present North Brabant ) , Staats-Vlaanderen ( present Zeeuws-Vlaanderen ) , Staats-Limburg ( around Maastricht ) and Staats-Oppergelre ( around Venlo , after 1715 ) .
Wood has always been used extensively for furniture , such as chairs and beds . It is also used for tool handles and cutlery , such as chopsticks , toothpicks , and other utensils , like the wooden spoon .
Religious beliefs in the Eastern Empire and Persia were in flux during the late 6th and early 7th centuries . Judaism was an active proselytising faith , and at least one Arab political leader converted to it . [ J ] Christianity had active missions competing with the Persians ' Zoroastrianism in seeking converts , especially among residents of the Arabian Peninsula . All these strands came together with the emergence of Islam in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad ( d. 632 ) . After his death , Islamic forces conquered much of the Eastern Empire and Persia , starting with Syria in 634–635 and reaching Egypt in 640–641 , Persia between 637 and 642 , North Africa in the later 7th century , and the Iberian Peninsula in 711 . By 714 , Islamic forces controlled much of the peninsula in a region they called Al-Andalus .
Strict separation of powers did not operate in The United Kingdom , the political structure of which served in most instances [ citation needed ] as a model for the government created by the U.S . Constitution . [ citation needed ] Under the UK Westminster system , based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government , Parliament ( consisting of the Sovereign ( King-in-Parliament ) , House of Lords and House of Commons ) was the supreme lawmaking authority . The executive branch acted in the name of the King ( " His Majesty 's Government " ) , as did the judiciary . The King 's Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament , and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons . One minister , the Lord Chancellor , was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords . Therefore , it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers , even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other . Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century . In New Jersey , the Governor also functioned as a member of the state 's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature . The President of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals ; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as Vice Presidents . In both Delaware and Pennsylvania , members of the executive council served at the same time as judges . On the other hand , many southern states explicitly required separation of powers . Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina and Georgia all kept the branches of government " separate and distinct . "
In 1839 , Melbourne resigned after Radicals and Tories ( both of whom Victoria detested ) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of Jamaica . The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery . The Queen commissioned a Tory , Sir Robert Peel , to form a new ministry . At the time , it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household , who were usually his political allies and their spouses . Many of the Queen 's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs , and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories . In what became known as the bedchamber crisis , Victoria , advised by Melbourne , objected to their removal . Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen , and consequently resigned his commission , allowing Melbourne to return to office .
Zen Buddhist teaching is often full of paradox , in order to loosen the grip of the ego and to facilitate the penetration into the realm of the True Self or Formless Self , which is equated with the Buddha himself . [ note 14 ] According to Zen master Kosho Uchiyama , when thoughts and fixation on the little " I " are transcended , an Awakening to a universal , non-dual Self occurs : " When we let go of thoughts and wake up to the reality of life that is working beyond them , we discover the Self that is living universal non-dual life ( before the separation into two ) that pervades all living creatures and all existence . " Thinking and thought must therefore not be allowed to confine and bind one .
His first professional TV job came when he was hired to direct one of the segments for the 1969 pilot episode of Night Gallery . The segment , " Eyes , " starred Joan Crawford ; she and Spielberg were reportedly close friends until her death . The episode is unusual in his body of work , in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later , more " mature " films . After this , and an episode of Marcus Welby , M.D. , Spielberg got his first feature-length assignment : an episode of The Name of the Game called " L.A. 2017 " . This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract . He did another segment on Night Gallery and did some work for shows such as Owen Marshall : Counselor at Law and The Psychiatrist , before landing the first series episode of Columbo ( previous episodes were actually TV films ) .
Winston Churchill , on forming his government in 1940 , created the office of Minister of Defence to exercise ministerial control over the Chiefs of Staff Committee and to co-ordinate defence matters . The post was held by the Prime Minister of the day until Clement Attlee 's government introduced the Ministry of Defence Act of 1946 . The new ministry was headed by a Minister of Defence who possessed a seat in the Cabinet . The three existing service Ministers—the Secretary of State for War , the First Lord of the Admiralty , and the Secretary of State for Air—remained in direct operational control of their respective services , but ceased to attend Cabinet .
Usually , the short-term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short-term interest rate target . In other instances , monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold . For example , in the case of the United States the Federal Reserve targets the federal funds rate , the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight . The other primary means of conducting monetary policy include : ( i ) Discount window lending ( as lender of last resort ) ; ( ii ) Fractional deposit lending ( changes in the reserve requirement ) ; ( iii ) Moral suasion ( cajoling certain market players to achieve specified outcomes ) ; ( iv ) " Open mouth operations " ( talking monetary policy with the market ) .
The Crimean War ( 1853–1856 ) was part of a long-running contest between the major European powers for influence over territories of the declining Ottoman Empire . The financial burden of the war led the Ottoman state to issue foreign loans amounting to 5 million pounds sterling on 4 August 1854 . The war caused an exodus of the Crimean Tatars , about 200,000 of whom moved to the Ottoman Empire in continuing waves of emigration . Toward the end of the Caucasian Wars , 90 % of the Circassians were ethnically cleansed and exiled from their homelands in the Caucasus and fled to the Ottoman Empire , resulting in the settlement of 500,000 to 700,000 Circassians in Turkey . [ page needed ] Some Circassian organisations give much higher numbers , totaling 1–1.5 million deported or killed .
A dense wave of smog began in the Central and Eastern part of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 kilometres ( 750 mi ) , including Tianjin , Hebei , Shandong , Jiangsu , Anhui , Shanghai and Zhejiang . A lack of cold air flow , combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions , collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region . The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province , especially in and around Nanjing , with its AQI pollution Index at " severely polluted " for five straight days and " heavily polluted " for nine . On 3 December 2013 , levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic metre , falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic metre on 4 December 2013 . Between 3:00 pm , 3 December and 2:00pm , 4 December local time , several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed , stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station . From 5 to 6 December , Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools . Children 's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent ; general incidence of bronchitis , pneumonia , upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased . The smog dissipated 12 December . Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind , automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure , and coal-powered district heating system in North China region . Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions ( mostly SO2 ) towards China 's east coast .
Some definitions of southern Europe , also known as Mediterranean Europe , include the countries of the Iberian peninsula ( Spain and Portugal ) , the Italian peninsula , southern France and Greece . Other definitions sometimes include the Balkan countries of southeast Europe , which are geographically in the southern part of Europe , but which have different historical , political , economic , and cultural backgrounds .
During the later stages of World War II , the entire Cold War , and to a lesser extent afterwards , uranium-235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons . Initially , two major types of fission bombs were built : a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238 . Later , a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb ( thermonuclear weapon ) was built , that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion . Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile ( unenriched ) uranium case , and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process .
Ronald Inden writes that by the 8th century CE symbols of Hindu gods " replaced the Buddha at the imperial centre and pinnacle of the cosmo-political system , the image or symbol of the Hindu god comes to be housed in a monumental temple and given increasingly elaborate imperial-style puja worship " . Although Buddhism did not disappear from India for several centuries after the eighth , royal proclivities for the cults of Vishnu and Shiva weakened Buddhism 's position within the sociopolitical context and helped make possible its decline .
Westminster Abbey , formally titled the Collegiate Church of St Peter at Westminster , is a large , mainly Gothic abbey church in the City of Westminster , London , located just to the west of the Palace of Westminster . It is one of the most notable religious buildings in the United Kingdom and has been the traditional place of coronation and burial site for English and , later , British monarchs . Between 1540 and 1556 the abbey had the status of a cathedral . Since 1560 , however , the building is no longer an abbey nor a cathedral , having instead the status of a Church of England " Royal Peculiar " —a church responsible directly to the sovereign . The building itself is the original abbey church .
Concurrently , the Somali Transitional Federal Government began preparations to revive the national postal service . The government 's overall reconstruction plan for Somali Post is structured into three Phases spread out over a period of ten years . Phase I will see the reconstruction of the postal headquarters and General Post Office ( GPO ) , as well as the establishment of 16 branch offices in the capital and 17 in regional bases . As of March 2012 , the Somali authorities have re-established Somalia 's membership with the Universal Postal Union ( UPU ) , and taken part once again in the Union 's affairs . They have also rehabilitated the GPO in Mogadishu , and appointed an official Postal Consultant to provide professional advice on the renovations . Phase II of the rehabilitation project involves the construction of 718 postal outlets from 2014 to 2016 . Phase III is slated to begin in 2017 , with the objective of creating 897 postal outlets by 2022 .
Once food leaves the crop , it passes to the midgut ( element 13 in numbered diagram ) , also known as the mesenteron , where the majority of digestion takes place . Microscopic projections from the midgut wall , called microvilli , increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed ; they tend to be close to the origin of the midgut . In some insects , the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary . For example , specialized microvilli producing digestive enzymes may more likely be near the end of the midgut , and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut . :32
The area north of the Congo River came under French sovereignty in 1880 as a result of Pierre de Brazza 's treaty with Makoko of the Bateke . This Congo Colony became known first as French Congo , then as Middle Congo in 1903 . In 1908 , France organized French Equatorial Africa ( AEF ) , comprising Middle Congo , Gabon , Chad , and Oubangui-Chari ( the modern Central African Republic ) . The French designated Brazzaville as the federal capital . Economic development during the first 50 years of colonial rule in Congo centered on natural-resource extraction . The methods were often brutal : construction of the Congo–Ocean Railroad following World War I has been estimated to have cost at least 14,000 lives .
The Royal Assent ceremony takes place in the Senate , as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons . On the day of the event , the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive . The Senate thereafter can not adjourn until after the ceremony . The speaker moves to sit beside the throne , the Mace Bearer , with mace in hand , stands adjacent to him or her , and the governor general enters to take the speaker 's chair . The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament , who follow Black Rod back to the Senate , the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons . In the Senate , those from the commons stand behind the bar , while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general , who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills ( which do not include appropriations bills ) . Once the list of bills is complete , the Clerk of the Senate states : " in Her Majesty 's name , His [ or Her ] Excellency the Governor General [ or the deputy ] doth assent to these bills . " If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent , the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general , who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent . When these bills have all been assented to , the Clerk of the Senate recites " in Her Majesty 's name , His [ or Her ] Excellency the Governor General [ or the deputy ] thanks her loyal subjects , accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills . The governor general or his or her deputy then depart parliament .
BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams . Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011 . Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference . All teams are named the " Cougars " , and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school 's mascot since 1953 . The school 's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song . Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years ( men when they 're 18 , women when 19 ) , BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools ' players . The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period . This has caused minor controversy , but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage , since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions . BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday , as well as expelling players due to honor code violations . Beginning in the 2011 season , BYU football competes in college football as an independent . In addition , most other sports now compete in the West Coast Conference . Teams in swimming and diving and indoor track and field for both men and women joined the men 's volleyball program in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation . For outdoor track and field , the Cougars became an Independent . Softball returned to the Western Athletic Conference , but spent only one season in the WAC ; the team moved to the Pacific Coast Softball Conference after the 2012 season . The softball program may move again after the 2013 season ; the July 2013 return of Pacific to the WCC will enable that conference to add softball as an official sport .
Railways must operate at variable speeds . Until the mid 1980s this was only practical with the brush-type DC motor , although such DC can be supplied from an AC catenary via on-board electric power conversion . Since such conversion was not well developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century , most early electrified railways used DC and many still do , particularly rapid transit ( subways ) and trams . Speed was controlled by connecting the traction motors in various series-parallel combinations , by varying the traction motors ' fields , and by inserting and removing starting resistances to limit motor current .
Present-day Christian religious bodies known for conducting their worship services without musical accompaniment include some Presbyterian churches devoted to the regulative principle of worship , Old Regular Baptists , Primitive Baptists , Plymouth Brethren , Churches of Christ , the Old German Baptist Brethren , Doukhobors the Byzantine Rite and the Amish , Old Order Mennonites and Conservative Mennonites . Certain high church services and other musical events in liturgical churches ( such as the Roman Catholic Mass and the Lutheran Divine Service ) may be a cappella , a practice remaining from apostolic times . Many Mennonites also conduct some or all of their services without instruments . Sacred Harp , a type of folk music , is an a cappella style of religious singing with shape notes , usually sung at singing conventions .
Integral to the story of the origin of the name " Antarctica " is how it was not named Terra Australis—this name was given to Australia instead , and it was because of a mistake made by people who decided that a significant landmass would not be found farther south than Australia . Explorer Matthew Flinders , in particular , has been credited with popularizing the transfer of the name Terra Australis to Australia . He justified the titling of his book A Voyage to Terra Australis ( 1814 ) by writing in the introduction :
The presence of pain in an animal can not be known for certain , but it can be inferred through physical and behavioral reactions . Specialists currently believe that all vertebrates can feel pain , and that certain invertebrates , like the octopus , might too . As for other animals , plants , or other entities , their ability to feel physical pain is at present a question beyond scientific reach , since no mechanism is known by which they could have such a feeling . In particular , there are no known nociceptors in groups such as plants , fungi , and most insects , except for instance in fruit flies .
Many scripts , including Arabic and Devanagari , have special orthographic rules that require certain combinations of letterforms to be combined into special ligature forms . The rules governing ligature formation can be quite complex , requiring special script-shaping technologies such as ACE ( Arabic Calligraphic Engine by DecoType in the 1980s and used to generate all the Arabic examples in the printed editions of the Unicode Standard ) , which became the proof of concept for OpenType ( by Adobe and Microsoft ) , Graphite ( by SIL International ) , or AAT ( by Apple ) .
20th Street starts at Avenue C , and 21st and 22nd Streets begin at First Avenue . They all end at Eleventh Avenue . Travel on the last block of the 20th , 21st and 22nd Streets , between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues , is in the opposite direction than it is on the rest of the respective street . 20th Street is very wide from the Avenue C to First Avenue .
In November 2013 MGM and the McClory estate formally settled the issue with Danjaq , LLC—sister company of Eon Productions—with MGM acquiring the full copyright film rights to the concept of Spectre and all of the characters associated with it . With the acquisition of the film rights and the organisation 's re-introduction to the series ' continuity , the SPECTRE acronym was discarded and the organisation reimagined as " Spectre " .
The Kakatiya dynasty was reduced to a vassal of the Khilji dynasty in 1310 after its defeat by Sultan Alauddin Khilji of the Delhi Sultanate . This lasted until 1321 , when the Kakatiya dynasty was annexed by Malik Kafur , Allaudin Khilji 's general . During this period , Alauddin Khilji took the Koh-i-Noor diamond , which is said to have been mined from the Kollur Mines of Golkonda , to Delhi . Muhammad bin Tughluq succeeded to the Delhi sultanate in 1325 , bringing Warangal under the rule of the Tughlaq dynasty until 1347 when Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah , a governor under bin Tughluq , rebelled against Delhi and established the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan Plateau , with Gulbarga , 200 km ( 124 mi ) west of Hyderabad , as its capital . The Bahmani kings ruled the region until 1518 and were the first independent Muslim rulers of the Deccan .
Computer security , also known as cybersecurity or IT security , is the protection of information systems from theft or damage to the hardware , the software , and to the information on them , as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide . It includes controlling physical access to the hardware , as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access , data and code injection , and due to malpractice by operators , whether intentional , accidental , or due to them being tricked into deviating from secure procedures .
The city 's Greektown and three downtown casino resort hotels serve as part of an entertainment hub . The Eastern Market farmer 's distribution center is the largest open-air flowerbed market in the United States and has more than 150 foods and specialty businesses . On Saturdays , about 45,000 people shop the city 's historic Eastern Market . The Midtown and the New Center area are centered on Wayne State University and Henry Ford Hospital . Midtown has about 50,000 residents and attracts millions of visitors each year to its museums and cultural centers ; for example , the Detroit Festival of the Arts in Midtown draws about 350,000 people .
While the incumbents of some sees are regularly made cardinals , and some countries are entitled to at least one cardinal by concordate ( usually earning its primate the cardinal 's hat ) , no see carries an actual right to the cardinalate , not even if its bishop is a Patriarch .
The synthesis of urea by Friedrich Wöhler opened a new research field , organic chemistry , and by the end of the 19th century , scientists were able to synthesize hundreds of organic compounds . The later part of the 19th century saw the exploitation of the Earth 's petrochemicals , after the exhaustion of the oil supply from whaling . By the 20th century , systematic production of refined materials provided a ready supply of products which provided not only energy , but also synthetic materials for clothing , medicine , and everyday disposable resources . Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in physiological chemistry , the precursor to biochemistry . The 20th century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry , with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom . Linus Pauling 's book on The Nature of the Chemical Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond angles in ever-more complicated molecules . Pauling 's work culminated in the physical modelling of DNA , the secret of life ( in the words of Francis Crick , 1953 ) . In the same year , the Miller–Urey experiment demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes , that basic constituents of proteins , simple amino acids , could themselves be built up from simpler molecules .
On 11 June 2009 , four Uyghurs who had been held in the United States Guantánamo Bay detention camp , in Cuba , were transferred to Bermuda . The four men were among 22 Uyghurs who claimed to be refugees , who were captured in 2001 in Pakistan after fleeing the American aerial bombardment of Afghanistan . They were accused of training to assist the Taliban 's military . They were cleared as safe for release from Guantánamo in 2005 or 2006 , but US domestic law prohibited deporting them back to China , their country of citizenship , because the US government determined that China was likely to violate their human rights .
In his role as god of prophecy and truth , Apollo had the epithets Manticus ( /ˈmæntᵻkəs/ MAN-ti-kəs ; Μαντικός , Mantikos , literally " prophetic " ) , Leschenorius ( /ˌlɛskᵻˈnɔəriəs/ LES-ki-NOHR-ee-əs ; Λεσχηνόριος , Leskhēnorios , from λεσχήνωρ , " converser " ) , and Loxias ( /ˈlɒksiəs/ LOK-see-əs ; Λοξίας , Loxias , from λέγειν , " to say " ) . The epithet " Loxias " has historically been associated with λοξός , " ambiguous " . In this respect , the Romans called him Coelispex ( /ˈsɛlᵻspɛks/ SEL-i-speks ; from Latin coelum , " sky " , and specere , " to look at " ) . The epithet Iatromantis ( /aɪˌætrəˈmæntɪs/ eye-AT-rə-MAN-tis ; Ἰατρομάντις , Iātromantis , from ἰατρός , " physician " , and μάντις , " prophet " ) refers to both his role as a god of healing and of prophecy . As god of music and arts , Apollo had the epithet Musagetes ( /mjuːˈsædʒᵻtiːz/ mew-SAJ-i-teez ; Doric Μουσαγέτας , Mousāgetās ) or Musegetes ( /mjuːˈsɛdʒᵻtiːz/ mew-SEJ-i-teez ; Μουσηγέτης , Mousēgetēs , from Μούσα , " Muse " , and ἡγέτης , " leader " ) .
Stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers , optical scanners , and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element , the print head carriage ( of dot matrix and inkjet printers ) , and the platen or feed rollers . Likewise , many computer plotters ( which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers ) used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement ; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems .
Nigeria has also been pervaded by political corruption . It was ranked 143 out of 182 countries in Transparency International 's 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index ; however , it improved to 136th position in 2014 . More than $ 400 billion were stolen from the treasury by Nigeria 's leaders between 1960 and 1999 . In late 2013 , Nigeria 's then central bank governor Lamido Sanusi informed President Goodluck Jonathan that the state oil company , NNPC had failed to remit US $ 20 billion of oil revenues , which it owed the state . Jonathan however dismissed the claim and replaced Sanusi for his mismanagement of the central bank 's budget . A Senate committee also found Sanusi’s account to be lacking substance . After the conclusion of the NNPC 's account Audit , it was announced in January 2015 that NNPC 's non-remitted revenue is actually US $ 1.48billion , which it needs to refund back to the Government .
While the largest European-American population in Montana overall is German , pockets of significant Scandinavian ancestry are prevalent in some of the farming-dominated northern and eastern prairie regions , parallel to nearby regions of North Dakota and Minnesota . Farmers of Irish , Scots , and English roots also settled in Montana . The historically mining-oriented communities of western Montana such as Butte have a wider range of European-American ethnicity ; Finns , Eastern Europeans and especially Irish settlers left an indelible mark on the area , as well as people originally from British mining regions such as Cornwall , Devon and Wales . The nearby city of Helena , also founded as a mining camp , had a similar mix in addition to a small Chinatown . Many of Montana 's historic logging communities originally attracted people of Scottish , Scandinavian , Slavic , English and Scots-Irish descent . [ citation needed ]
Later , the constitution was amended to state that the citizens of the 16 states had successfully achieved the unity of Germany in free self-determination and that the Basic Law thus applied to the entire German people . Article 23 , which had allowed " any other parts of Germany " to join , was rephrased . It had been used in 1957 to reintegrate the Saar Protectorate as the Saarland into the Federal Republic , and this was used as a model for German reunification in 1990 . The amended article now defines the participation of the Federal Council and the 16 German states in matters concerning the European Union .
Over 90 weeklies , fortnightlies and quarterlies are published in Sanskrit . Sudharma , a daily newspaper in Sanskrit , has been published out of Mysore , India , since 1970 , while Sanskrit Vartman Patram and Vishwasya Vrittantam started in Gujarat during the last five years . Since 1974 , there has been a short daily news broadcast on state-run All India Radio . These broadcasts are also made available on the internet on AIR 's website . Sanskrit news is broadcast on TV and on the internet through the DD National channel at 6:55 AM IST .
Agriculture and forestry have declined in importance over the decades . Nevertheless , they are more important than in the most other areas of Germany , especially within rural regions . 54 % of Thuringia 's territory is in agricultural use . The fertile basins such as the large Thuringian Basin or the smaller Goldene Aue , Orlasenke and Osterland are in intensive use for growing cereals , vegetables , fruits and energy crops . Important products are apples , strawberries , cherries and plums in the fruit sector , cabbage , potatoes , cauliflower , tomatoes ( grown in greenhouses ) , onions , cucumbers and asparagus in the vegetable sector , as well as maize , rapeseed , wheat , barley and sugar beets in the crop sector .
Several Americans , especially Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson , played a major role in bringing Enlightenment ideas to the New World and in influencing British and French thinkers . Franklin was influential for his political activism and for his advances in physics . The cultural exchange during the Age of Enlightenment ran in both directions across the Atlantic . Thinkers such as Paine , Locke , and Rousseau all take Native American cultural practices as examples of natural freedom . The Americans closely followed English and Scottish political ideas , as well as some French thinkers such as Montesquieu . As deists , they were influenced by ideas of John Toland ( 1670–1722 ) and Matthew Tindal ( 1656–1733 ) . During the Enlightenment there was a great emphasis upon liberty , democracy , republicanism and religious tolerance . Attempts to reconcile science and religion resulted in a widespread rejection of prophecy , miracle and revealed religion in preference for Deism – especially by Thomas Paine in The Age of Reason and by Thomas Jefferson in his short Jefferson Bible – from which all supernatural aspects were removed .
James Liebman , a professor of law at Columbia Law School , stated in 1996 that his study found that when habeas corpus petitions in death penalty cases were traced from conviction to completion of the case that there was " a 40 percent success rate in all capital cases from 1978 to 1995 . " Similarly , a study by Ronald Tabak in a law review article puts the success rate in habeas corpus cases involving death row inmates even higher , finding that between " 1976 and 1991 , approximately 47 percent of the habeas petitions filed by death row inmates were granted . " The different numbers are largely definitional , rather than substantive . Freedam 's statistics looks at the percentage of all death penalty cases reversed , while the others look only at cases not reversed prior to habeas corpus review .
On April 26 , 1988 , about 500 people participated in a march organized by the Ukrainian Cultural Club on Kiev 's Khreschatyk Street to mark the second anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster , carrying placards with slogans like " Openness and Democracy to the End . " Between May and June 1988 , Ukrainian Catholics in western Ukraine celebrated the Millennium of Christianity in Kievan Rus ' in secret by holding services in the forests of Buniv , Kalush , Hoshiv , and Zarvanytsia . On June 5 , 1988 , as the official celebrations of the Millennium were held in Moscow , the Ukrainian Cultural Club hosted its own observances in Kiev at the monument to St. Volodymyr the Great , the grand prince of Kievan Rus ' .
In 2006 , Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service . Issues included call transfers of more than 45 % of calls and long wait times . Dell 's blog detailed the response : " We 're spending more than a $ 100 million — and a lot of blood , sweat and tears of talented people — to fix this . " Later in the year , the company increased its spending on customer service to $ 150 million . Despite significant investment in this space , Dell continues to face public scrutiny with even the company 's own website littered with complaints regarding the issue escalation process .

With the Japanese CAP out of position and the carriers at their most vulnerable , SBD Dauntlesses from Enterprise and Yorktown appeared at an altitude of 10,000 feet ( 3,000 m ) and commenced their attack , quickly dealing fatal blows to three fleet carriers : Sōryū , Kaga , and Akagi . Within minutes , all three were ablaze and had to be abandoned with great loss of life . Hiryū managed to survive the wave of dive bombers and launched a counter-attack against the American carriers which caused severe damage to Yorktown ( which was later finished off by a Japanese submarine ) . However , a second attack from the U.S. carriers a few hours later found and destroyed Hiryū , the last remaining fleet carrier available to Nagumo . With his carriers lost and the Americans withdrawn out of range of his powerful battleships , Yamamoto was forced to call off the operation , leaving Midway in American hands . The battle proved to be a decisive victory for the Allies . For the second time , Japanese expansion had been checked and its formidable Combined Fleet was significantly weakened by the loss of four fleet carriers and many highly trained , virtually irreplaceable , personnel . Japan would be largely on the defensive for the rest of the war .
In the Islamic tradition , Mary and Jesus were the only children who could not be touched by Satan at the moment of their birth , for God imposed a veil between them and Satan . According to author Shabbir Akhtar , the Islamic perspective on Mary 's Immaculate Conception is compatible with the Catholic doctrine of the same topic . " O People of the Book ! Do not go beyond the bounds in your religion , and do not say anything of Allah but the truth . The Messiah , Jesus son of Mary , was but a Messenger of God , and a Word of His ( Power ) which He conveyed to Mary , and a spirit from Him . So believe in Allah ( as the One , Unique God ) , and His Messengers ( including Jesus , as Messenger ) ; and do not say : ( Allah is one of ) a trinity . Give up ( this assertion ) â€ " ( it is ) for your own good ( to do so ) . Allah is but One Allah ; All-Glorified He is in that He is absolutely above having a son . To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth . And Allah suffices as the One to be relied on , to Whom affairs should be referred . " Quran 4/171
Since the start of the 1994–95 season , the FA Cup has been sponsored . However , to protect the identity of the competition , the sponsored name has always included 'The FA Cup ' in addition to the sponsor 's name , unlike sponsorship deals for the League Cup where the word 'cup ' is preceded by only the sponsor 's name . Sponsorship deals run for four years , though – as in the case of E.ON – one-year extensions may be agreed . Emirates airline is the sponsor from 2015 to 2018 , renaming the competition as 'The Emirates FA Cup ' , unlike previous editions , which included 'The FA Cup in association with E.ON ' and 'The FA Cup with Budweiser ' .
International observers of Council of Europe and US Department of State have questioned the fairness of Armenia 's parliamentary and presidential elections and constitutional referendum since 1995 , citing polling deficiencies , lack of cooperation by the Electoral Commission , and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places . Freedom House categorized Armenia in its 2008 report as a " Semi-consolidated Authoritarian Regime " ( along with Moldova , Kosovo , Kyrgyzstan , and Russia ) and ranked Armenia 20th among 29 nations in transition , with a Democracy Score of 5.21 out of 7 ( 7 represents the lowest democratic progress ) .
Sometime after the publication of the Eclogues ( probably before 37 BC ) , Virgil became part of the circle of Maecenas , Octavian 's capable agent d'affaires who sought to counter sympathy for Antony among the leading families by rallying Roman literary figures to Octavian 's side . Virgil came to know many of the other leading literary figures of the time , including Horace , in whose poetry he is often mentioned , and Varius Rufus , who later helped finish the Aeneid .
Microsoft Windows 3.0 was released in May 1990 , and according to a common saying at the time " Windows was not as good as Macintosh , but it was good enough for the average user " . Though still a graphical wrapper that relied upon MS-DOS , 3.0 was the first iteration of Windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the much more expensive Macintosh platform . It also did not help matters that during the previous year Jean-Louis Gassée had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers . Finally , there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding PC industry in 1989 , forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices which dropped Apple 's margins .
In ordinary circumstances , transduction , conjugation , and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species , but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences , such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance . In such cases , gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions . Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens .
West of Fort Washington Avenue , 181st Street is largely residential , bordering Hudson Heights and having a few shops to serve the local residents . East of Fort Washington Avenue , the street becomes increasingly commercial , becoming dominated entirely by retail stores where the street reaches Broadway and continues as such until reaching the Harlem River . It is the area 's major shopping district .
World War I was a watershed event in human history , changing views of governments and politics . The Russian Revolution of 1917 ( and similar , albeit less successful , revolutions in many other European countries ) brought communism - and in particular the political theory of Leninism , but also on a smaller level Luxemburgism ( gradually ) - on the world stage . At the same time , social democratic parties won elections and formed governments for the first time , often as a result of the introduction of universal suffrage . However , a group of central European economists led by Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek identified the collectivist underpinnings to the various new socialist and fascist doctrines of government power as being different brands of political totalitarianism .
Frédéric François Chopin ( /ˈʃoʊpæn/ ; French pronunciation : ​ [ fʁe.de.ʁik fʁɑ̃.swa ʃɔ.pɛ̃ ] ; 22 February or 1 March 1810 – 17 October 1849 ) , born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin , [ n 1 ] was a Polish and French ( by citizenship and birth of father ) composer and a virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era , who wrote primarily for the solo piano . He gained and has maintained renown worldwide as one of the leading musicians of his era , whose " poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation . " Chopin was born in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw , and grew up in Warsaw , which after 1815 became part of Congress Poland . A child prodigy , he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20 , less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising .
Until the Church Building Act of 1818 , the period saw relatively few churches built in Britain , which was already well-supplied , although in the later years of the period the demand for Non-conformist and Roman Catholic places of worship greatly increased . Anglican churches that were built were designed internally to allow maximum audibility , and visibility , for preaching , so the main nave was generally wider and shorter than in medieval plans , and often there were no side-aisles . Galleries were common in new churches . Especially in country parishes , the external appearance generally retained the familiar signifiers of a Gothic church , with a tower or spire , a large west front with one or more doors , and very large windows along the nave , but all with any ornament drawn from the classical vocabulary . Where funds permitted , a classical temple portico with columns and a pediment might be used at the west front . Decoration inside was very limited , but churches filled up with monuments to the prosperous .
Saint Athanasius of Alexandria ( /ˌæθəˈneɪʃəs/ ; Greek : Ἀθανάσιος Ἀλεξανδρείας , Athanásios Alexandrías ; c. 296–298 – 2 May 373 ) , also called Athanasius the Great , Athanasius the Confessor or , primarily in the Coptic Orthodox Church , Athanasius the Apostolic , was the twentieth bishop of Alexandria ( as Athanasius I ) . His episcopate lasted 45 years ( c. 8 June 328 – 2 May 373 ) , of which over 17 were spent in five exiles ordered by four different Roman emperors . Athanasius is a renowned Christian theologian , a Church Father , the chief defender of Trinitarianism against Arianism , and a noted Egyptian leader of the fourth century .
Political unification returned in the mid-16th century , due to the efforts of Taungoo , a former vassal state of Ava . Taungoo 's young , ambitious king Tabinshwehti defeated the more powerful Hanthawaddy in the Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War ( 1534–41 ) . His successor Bayinnaung went on to conquer a vast swath of mainland Southeast Asia including the Shan states , Lan Na , Manipur , Mong Mao , the Ayutthaya Kingdom , Lan Xang and southern Arakan . However , the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia unravelled soon after Bayinnaung 's death in 1581 , completely collapsing by 1599 . Ayutthaya seized Tenasserim and Lan Na , and Portuguese mercenaries established Portuguese rule at Thanlyin ( Syriam ) .
Carnival in Haiti started in 1804 in the capital Port-au-Prince after the declaration of independence . The Port-au-Prince Carnival is one of the largest in North America . It is known as Kanaval in the Creole language . It starts in January , known as " Pre-Kanaval " , while the main carnival activities begin in February . In July 2012 , Haiti had another carnival called Kanaval de Fleur . Beautiful costumes , floats , Rara parades , masks , foods , and popular rasin music ( like Boukman Eksperyans , Foula Vodoule , Tokay , Boukan Ginen , Eritaj , etc . ) and kompa bands ( such as T-Vice , Djakout No . 1 , Sweet Micky , Kreyòl La , D.P . Express , Mizik Mizik , Ram , T-Micky , Carimi , Djakout Mizik , and Scorpio Fever ) play for dancers in the streets of the plaza of Champ-de-Mars . An annual song competition takes place .
Air defence in naval tactics , especially within a carrier group , is often built around a system of concentric layers with the aircraft carrier at the centre . The outer layer will usually be provided by the carrier 's aircraft , specifically its AEW & C aircraft combined with the CAP . If an attacker is able to penetrate this layer , then the next layers would come from the surface-to-air missiles carried by the carrier 's escorts ; the area-defence missiles , such as the RIM-67 Standard , with a range of up to 100 nmi , and the point-defence missiles , like the RIM-162 ESSM , with a range of up to 30 nmi . Finally , virtually every modern warship will be fitted with small-calibre guns , including a CIWS , which is usually a radar-controlled Gatling gun of between 20mm and 30mm calibre capable of firing several thousand rounds per minute .
The Ottomans abolished the feudal system previously in place and applied the millet system to Cyprus , under which non-Muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities . In a reversal from the days of Latin rule , the head of the Church of Cyprus was invested as leader of the Greek Cypriot population and acted as mediator between Christian Greek Cypriots and the Ottoman authorities . This status ensured that the Church of Cyprus was in a position to end the constant encroachments of the Roman Catholic Church . Ottoman rule of Cyprus was at times indifferent , at times oppressive , depending on the temperaments of the sultans and local officials , and the island began over 250 years of economic decline .
" The mind-stuff of the world is , of course , something more general than our individual conscious minds ... . The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time ; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it ... . It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed , has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness ... . Consciousness is not sharply defined , but fades into subconsciousness ; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature ... . It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character . But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience , and all else is remote inference . "
In 1578 , Elizabeth I granted a patent to Humphrey Gilbert for discovery and overseas exploration . That year , Gilbert sailed for the West Indies with the intention of engaging in piracy and establishing a colony in North America , but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic . In 1583 he embarked on a second attempt , on this occasion to the island of Newfoundland whose harbour he formally claimed for England , although no settlers were left behind . Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England , and was succeeded by his half-brother , Walter Raleigh , who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584 . Later that year , Raleigh founded the colony of Roanoke on the coast of present-day North Carolina , but lack of supplies caused the colony to fail .
The assumption that black-body radiation is thermal leads to an accurate prediction : the total amount of emitted energy goes up with the temperature according to a definite rule , the Stefan–Boltzmann law ( 1879–84 ) . But it was also known that the colour of the light given off by a hot object changes with the temperature , so that " white hot " is hotter than " red hot " . Nevertheless , Wilhelm Wien discovered the mathematical relationship between the peaks of the curves at different temperatures , by using the principle of adiabatic invariance . At each different temperature , the curve is moved over by Wien 's displacement law ( 1893 ) . Wien also proposed an approximation for the spectrum of the object , which was correct at high frequencies ( short wavelength ) but not at low frequencies ( long wavelength ) . It still was not clear why the spectrum of a hot object had the form that it has ( see diagram ) .
In 1931 , RCA Victor launched the first commercially available vinyl long-playing record , marketed as program-transcription discs . These revolutionary discs were designed for playback at 33 1⁄3 rpm and pressed on a 30 cm diameter flexible plastic disc , with a duration of about ten minutes playing time per side . RCA Victor 's early introduction of a long-play disc was a commercial failure for several reasons including the lack of affordable , reliable consumer playback equipment and consumer wariness during the Great Depression . Because of financial hardships that plagued the recording industry during that period ( and RCA 's own parched revenues ) , Victor 's long-playing records were discontinued by early 1933 .
In the 1982 Falklands War , the Argentine armed forces deployed the newest west European weapons including the Oerlikon GDF-002 35 mm twin cannon and SAM Roland . The Rapier missile system was the primary GBAD system , used by both British artillery and RAF regiment , a few brand-new FIM-92 Stinger were used by British special forces . Both sides also used the Blowpipe missile . British naval missiles used included Sea Dart and the older Sea Slug longer range systems , Sea Cat and the new Sea Wolf short range systems . Machine guns in AA mountings was used both ashore and afloat .
The government broadened land ownership by returning land that had been sold to large landowners in the late Ming period by families unable to pay the land tax . To give people more incentives to participate in the market , they reduced the tax burden in comparison with the late Ming , and replaced the corvée system with a head tax used to hire laborers . The administration of the Grand Canal was made more efficient , and transport opened to private merchants . A system of monitoring grain prices eliminated severe shortages , and enabled the price of rice to rise slowly and smoothly through the 18th century . Wary of the power of wealthy merchants , Qing rulers limited their trading licenses and usually refused them permission to open new mines , except in poor areas . These restrictions on domestic resource exploration , as well as on foreign trade , are held by some scholars as a cause of the Great Divergence , by which the Western world overtook China economically .
There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900 , except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles . Before the inception of the World Cup , the Olympics ( especially during the 1920s ) had the same status as the World Cup . Originally , the event was for amateurs only ; however , since the 1984 Summer Olympics , professional players have been permitted , albeit with certain restrictions which prevent countries from fielding their strongest sides . The Olympic men 's tournament is played at Under-23 level . In the past the Olympics have allowed a restricted number of over-age players per team . A women 's tournament was added in 1996 ; in contrast to the men 's event , full international sides without age restrictions play the women 's Olympic tournament .
The capital city of Windhoek plays a very important role in Namibia 's tourism due to its central location and close proximity to Hosea Kutako International Airport . According to The Namibia Tourism Exit Survey , which was produced by the Millennium Challenge Corporation for the Namibian Directorate of Tourism , 56 % of all tourists visiting Namibia during the time period , 2012 - 2013 , visited Windhoek . Many of Namibia 's tourism related parastatals and governing bodies such as Namibia Wildlife Resorts , Air Namibia and the Namibia Tourism Board as well as Namibia 's tourism related trade associations such as the Hospitality Association of Namibia are also all headquartered in Windhoek . There are also a number of notable hotels in Windhoek such as Windhoek Country Club Resort and some international hotel chains also operate in Windhoek , such as Avani Hotels and Resorts and Hilton Hotels and Resorts .
In 1941 , Nasser was posted to Khartoum , Sudan , which was part of Egypt at the time . Nasser returned to Sudan in September 1942 after a brief stay in Egypt , then secured a position as an instructor in the Cairo Royal Military Academy in May 1943 . In 1942 , the British Ambassador Miles Lampson marched into King Farouk 's palace and ordered him to dismiss Prime Minister Hussein Sirri Pasha for having pro-Axis sympathies . Nasser saw the incident as a blatant violation of Egyptian sovereignty and wrote , " I am ashamed that our army has not reacted against this attack " , and wished for " calamity " to overtake the British . Nasser was accepted into the General Staff College later that year . He began to form a group of young military officers with strong nationalist sentiments who supported some form of revolution . Nasser stayed in touch with the group 's members primarily through Amer , who continued to seek out interested officers within the Egyptian Armed Force 's various branches and presented Nasser with a complete file on each of them .
Timely 's first publication , Marvel Comics # 1 ( cover dated Oct. 1939 ) , included the first appearance of Carl Burgos ' android superhero the Human Torch , and the first appearances of Bill Everett 's anti-hero Namor the Sub-Mariner , among other features . The issue was a great success , with it and a second printing the following month selling , combined , nearly 900,000 copies . While its contents came from an outside packager , Funnies , Inc. , Timely had its own staff in place by the following year . The company 's first true editor , writer-artist Joe Simon , teamed with artist and emerging industry notable Jack Kirby to create one of the first patriotically themed superheroes , Captain America , in Captain America Comics # 1 ( March 1941 ) . It , too , proved a hit , with sales of nearly one million . Goodman formed Timely Comics , Inc. , beginning with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 1941 .
The first post-Classical published classification of humans into distinct races seems to be François Bernier 's Nouvelle division de la terre par les différents espèces ou races qui l'habitent ( " New division of Earth by the different species or races which inhabit it " ) , published in 1684 . In the 18th century the differences among human groups became a focus of scientific investigation . But the scientific classification of phenotypic variation was frequently coupled with racist ideas about innate predispositions of different groups , always attributing the most desirable features to the White , European race and arranging the other races along a continuum of progressively undesirable attributes . The 1735 classification of Carl Linnaeus , inventor of zoological taxonomy , divided the human race Homo sapiens into continental varieties of europaeus , asiaticus , americanus , and afer , each associated with a different humour : sanguine , melancholic , choleric , and phlegmatic , respectively . Homo sapiens europaeus was described as active , acute , and adventurous , whereas Homo sapiens afer was said to be crafty , lazy , and careless .
After the expulsion of the German population ethnic Russians , Belarusians , and Ukrainians were settled in the northern part . In the Soviet part of the region , a policy of eliminating all remnants of German history was pursued . All German place names were replaced by new Russian names . The exclave was a military zone , which was closed to foreigners ; Soviet citizens could only enter with special permission . In 1967 the remnants of Königsberg Castle were demolished on the orders of Leonid Brezhnev to make way for a new " House of the Soviets " .
Beyoncé attended St. Mary 's Elementary School in Fredericksburg , Texas , where she enrolled in dance classes . Her singing talent was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and she finished it , able to hit the high-pitched notes . Beyoncé 's interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven , singing John Lennon 's " Imagine " to beat 15/16-year-olds . In fall of 1990 , Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School , a music magnet school in Houston , where she would perform with the school 's choir . She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts and later Alief Elsik High School . Beyoncé was also a member of the choir at St. John 's United Methodist Church as a soloist for two years .
In March 1984 , Pioneer introduced the first consumer player with a solid-state laser , the LD-700 . It was also the first LD player to load from the front and not the top . One year earlier Hitachi introduced an expensive industrial player with a laser diode , but the player , which had poor picture quality due to an inadequate dropout compensator , was made only in limited quantities . After Pioneer released the LD-700 , gas lasers were no longer used in consumer players , despite their advantages , although Philips continued to use gas lasers in their industrial units until 1985 .
Gaddafi organized demonstrations and distributed posters criticizing the monarchy . In October 1961 , he led a demonstration protesting Syria 's secession from the United Arab Republic . During this they broke windows of a local hotel accused of serving alcohol . Catching the authorities ' attention , they expelled his family from Sabha . Gaddafi moved to Misrata , there attending Misrata Secondary School . Maintaining his interest in Arab nationalist activism , he refused to join any of the banned political parties active in the city – including the Arab Nationalist Movement , the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party , and the Muslim Brotherhood – claiming he rejected factionalism . He read voraciously on the subjects of Nasser and the French Revolution of 1789 , as well as the works of Syrian political theorist Michel Aflaq and biographies of Abraham Lincoln , Sun Yat-sen , and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk .
The growing likelihood of war in Europe dominated the early reign of George VI . The King was constitutionally bound to support Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 's appeasement of Hitler . However , when the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the Munich Agreement in 1938 , they invited him to appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with them . This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional , as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family . While broadly popular among the general public , Chamberlain 's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the House of Commons , which led historian John Grigg to describe the King 's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as " the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century " .
Many of the city 's buildings are in the Georgian style , although there are a number of examples of modern landmark structures , such as County Hall tower , which was , at one time the tallest building in Ireland until being superseded by another Cork City building : The Elysian . Across the river from County Hall is Ireland 's longest building ; built in Victorian times , Our Lady 's Psychiatric Hospital has now been renovated and converted into a residential housing complex called Atkins Hall , after its architect William Atkins .
Green is the color for green parties , Islamist parties , Nordic agrarian parties and Irish republican parties . Orange is sometimes a color of nationalism , such as in the Netherlands , in Israel with the Orange Camp or with Ulster Loyalists in Northern Ireland ; it is also a color of reform such as in Ukraine . In the past , Purple was considered the color of royalty ( like white ) , but today it is sometimes used for feminist parties . White also is associated with nationalism . " Purple Party " is also used as an academic hypothetical of an undefined party , as a Centrist party in the United States ( because purple is created from mixing the main parties ' colors of red and blue ) and as a highly idealistic " peace and love " party—in a similar vein to a Green Party , perhaps . Black is generally associated with fascist parties , going back to Benito Mussolini 's blackshirts , but also with Anarchism . Similarly , brown is sometimes associated with Nazism , going back to the Nazi Party 's tan-uniformed storm troopers .
The provisional results of the 2014 Myanmar Census show that the total population is 51,419,420 . This figure includes an estimated 1,206,353 persons in parts of northern Rakhine State , Kachin State and Kayin State who were not counted . People who were out of the country at the time of the census are not included in these figures . There are over 600,000 registered migrant workers from Myanmar in Thailand , and millions more work illegally . Burmese migrant workers account for 80 % of Thailand 's migrant workers . Population density is 76 per square kilometre ( 200/sq mi ) , among the lowest in Southeast Asia .
Since the founding of Freemasonry , many Bishops of the Church of England have been Freemasons , such as Archbishop Geoffrey Fisher . In the past , few members of the Church of England would have seen any incongruity in concurrently adhering to Anglican Christianity and practicing Freemasonry . In recent decades , however , reservations about Freemasonry have increased within Anglicanism , perhaps due to the increasing prominence of the evangelical wing of the church . The former Archbishop of Canterbury , Dr Rowan Williams , appeared to harbour some reservations about Masonic ritual , whilst being anxious to avoid causing offence to Freemasons inside and outside the Church of England . In 2003 he felt it necessary to apologise to British Freemasons after he said that their beliefs were incompatible with Christianity and that he had barred the appointment of Freemasons to senior posts in his diocese when he was Bishop of Monmouth .
However a log-periodic dipole array consists of a number of dipole elements of different lengths in order to obtain a somewhat directional antenna having an extremely wide bandwidth : these are frequently used for television reception in fringe areas . The dipole antennas composing it are all considered " active elements " since they are all electrically connected together ( and to the transmission line ) . On the other hand , a superficially similar dipole array , the Yagi-Uda Antenna ( or simply " Yagi " ) , has only one dipole element with an electrical connection ; the other so-called parasitic elements interact with the electromagnetic field in order to realize a fairly directional antenna but one which is limited to a rather narrow bandwidth . The Yagi antenna has similar looking parasitic dipole elements but which act differently due to their somewhat different lengths . There may be a number of so-called " directors " in front of the active element in the direction of propagation , and usually a single ( but possibly more ) " reflector " on the opposite side of the active element .
Dell previously had its headquarters in the Arboretum complex in northern Austin , Texas . In 1989 Dell occupied 127,000 square feet ( 11,800 m2 ) in the Arboretum complex . In 1990 , Dell had 1,200 employees in its headquarters . In 1993 , Dell submitted a document to Round Rock officials , titled " Dell Computer Corporate Headquarters , Round Rock , Texas , May 1993 Schematic Design . " Despite the filing , during that year the company said that it was not going to move its headquarters . In 1994 , Dell announced that it was moving most of its employees out of the Arboretum , but that it was going to continue to occupy the top floor of the Arboretum and that the company 's official headquarters address would continue to be the Arboretum . The top floor continued to hold Dell 's board room , demonstration center , and visitor meeting room . Less than one month prior to August 29 , 1994 , Dell moved 1,100 customer support and telephone sales employees to Round Rock . Dell 's lease in the Arboretum had been scheduled to expire in 1994 .
During the late Bronze Age the island experienced two waves of Greek settlement . The first wave consisted of Mycenaean Greek traders who started visiting Cyprus around 1400 BC . A major wave of Greek settlement is believed to have taken place following the Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece from 1100 to 1050 BC , with the island 's predominantly Greek character dating from this period . Cyprus occupies an important role in Greek mythology being the birthplace of Aphrodite and Adonis , and home to King Cinyras , Teucer and Pygmalion . Beginning in the 8th century BC Phoenician colonies were founded on the south coast of Cyprus , near present-day Larnaca and Salamis .
In 1937 , the Empire of Japan started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931 , beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War ( often considered a theatre of World War II ) . Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal Nanking Massacre ( the " Rape of Nanking " ) . Even children , the elderly , and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army . The total death toll , including estimates made by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal , was between 300,000 and 350,000 . The city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre . The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event .
Dutch is one of the closest relatives of both German and English [ n 5 ] and is said to be roughly in between them . [ n 6 ] Dutch , like English , has not undergone the High German consonant shift , does not use Germanic umlaut as a grammatical marker , has largely abandoned the use of the subjunctive , and has levelled much of its morphology , including the case system . [ n 7 ] Features shared with German include the survival of three grammatical genders—albeit with few grammatical consequences [ n 8 ] —as well as the use of modal particles , final-obstruent devoicing , and a similar word order . [ n 9 ] Dutch vocabulary is mostly Germanic and incorporates more Romance loans than German but fewer than English . [ n 10 ]
The Warsaw Treaty 's organization was two-fold : the Political Consultative Committee handled political matters , and the Combined Command of Pact Armed Forces controlled the assigned multi-national forces , with headquarters in Warsaw , Poland . Furthermore , the Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization which commands and controls all the military forces of the member countries was also a First Deputy Minister of Defense of the USSR , and the Chief of Combined Staff of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization was also a First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR . Therefore , although ostensibly an international collective security alliance , the USSR dominated the Warsaw Treaty armed forces .
Somalia established its first ISP in 1999 , one of the last countries in Africa to get connected to the Internet . According to the telecommunications resource Balancing Act , growth in internet connectivity has since then grown considerably , with around 53 % of the entire nation covered as of 2009 . Both internet commerce and telephony have consequently become among the quickest growing local businesses .
Special guest referees may be used from time to time ; by virtue of their celebrity status , they are often scripted to dispense with the appearance of neutrality and use their influence to unfairly influence the outcome of the match for added dramatic impact . Face special referees will often fight back against hostile heel wrestlers , particularly if the special referee is either a wrestler themselves or a famous martial artist ( such as Tito Ortiz in the main event at TNA 's THard Justice in 2005 ) . They also have the power to eject from ringside any of the heel wrestler 's entourage/stable , who may otherwise interfere with the match .
Midway proved to be the last great naval battle for two years . The United States used the ensuing period to turn its vast industrial potential into increased numbers of ships , planes , and trained aircrew . At the same time , Japan , lacking an adequate industrial base or technological strategy , a good aircrew training program , or adequate naval resources and commerce defense , fell further and further behind . In strategic terms the Allies began a long movement across the Pacific , seizing one island base after another . Not every Japanese stronghold had to be captured ; some , like Truk , Rabaul , and Formosa , were neutralized by air attack and bypassed . The goal was to get close to Japan itself , then launch massive strategic air attacks , improve the submarine blockade , and finally ( only if necessary ) execute an invasion .
The state has a rich history in ballet with five Native American ballerinas attaining worldwide fame . These were Yvonne Chouteau , sisters Marjorie and Maria Tallchief , Rosella Hightower and Moscelyne Larkin , known collectively as the Five Moons . The New York Times rates the Tulsa Ballet as one of the top ballet companies in the United States . The Oklahoma City Ballet and University of Oklahoma 's dance program were formed by ballerina Yvonne Chouteau and husband Miguel Terekhov . The University program was founded in 1962 and was the first fully accredited program of its kind in the United States .
The first documented visit by a European was in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano , a Florentine explorer in the service of the French crown , who sailed his ship La Dauphine into New York Harbor . He claimed the area for France and named it " Nouvelle Angoulême " ( New Angoulême ) .
During the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States , huge stockpiles of uranium were amassed and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium . Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 , an estimated 600 short tons ( 540 metric tons ) of highly enriched weapons grade uranium ( enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads ) have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the Russian Federation and several other former Soviet states . Police in Asia , Europe , and South America on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium , most of which was from ex-Soviet sources . From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection , Control , and Accounting Program , operated by the federal government of the United States , spent approximately US $ 550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia . This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities . Scientific American reported in February 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair . According to an interview from the article , one facility had been storing samples of enriched ( weapons grade ) uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project ; another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box .
Other major newspapers include Miami Today , headquartered in Brickell , Miami New Times , headquartered in Midtown , Miami Sun Post , South Florida Business Journal , Miami Times , and Biscayne Boulevard Times . An additional Spanish-language newspapers , Diario Las Americas also serve Miami . The Miami Herald is Miami 's primary newspaper with over a million readers and is headquartered in Downtown in Herald Plaza . Several other student newspapers from the local universities , such as the oldest , the University of Miami 's The Miami Hurricane , Florida International University 's The Beacon , Miami-Dade College 's The Metropolis , Barry University 's The Buccaneer , amongst others . Many neighborhoods and neighboring areas also have their own local newspapers such as the Aventura News , Coral Gables Tribune , Biscayne Bay Tribune , and the Palmetto Bay News .
In addition , like most Slavic languages , the Shtokavian verb also has one of two aspects : perfective or imperfective . Most verbs come in pairs , with the perfective verb being created out of the imperfective by adding a prefix or making a stem change . The imperfective aspect typically indicates that the action is unfinished , in progress , or repetitive ; while the perfective aspect typically denotes that the action was completed , instantaneous , or of limited duration . Some Štokavian tenses ( namely , aorist and imperfect ) favor a particular aspect ( but they are rarer or absent in Čakavian and Kajkavian ) . Actually , aspects " compensate " for the relative lack of tenses , because aspect of the verb determines whether the act is completed or in progress in the referred time .
There were serious scientific objections to the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution , including Karl von Nägeli 's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection . Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics . His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson ( later awarded the title Lord Kelvin ) , who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years . Darwin accepted blending inheritance , but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits , natural selection could not accumulate useful traits . Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition . Mivart supported directed evolution , and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection . In response , Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition . The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century .
The adolescent growth spurt is a rapid increase in the individual 's height and weight during puberty resulting from the simultaneous release of growth hormones , thyroid hormones , and androgens . Males experience their growth spurt about two years later , on average , than females . During their peak height velocity ( the time of most rapid growth ) , adolescents grow at a growth rate nearly identical to that of a toddler—about 4 inches ( 10.3 cm ) a year for males and 3.5 inches ( 9 cm ) for females . In addition to changes in height , adolescents also experience a significant increase in weight ( Marshall , 1978 ) . The weight gained during adolescence constitutes nearly half of one 's adult body weight . Teenage and early adult males may continue to gain natural muscle growth even after puberty .
Current Governor of the Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan had predicted the crisis in 2005 when he became chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.In 2005 , at a celebration honouring Alan Greenspan , who was about to retire as chairman of the US Federal Reserve , Rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector . In that paper , " Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier ? " , Rajan " argued that disaster might loom . " Rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to " take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but , in return , offer generous compensation the rest of the time . These risks are known as tail risks . But perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialise , financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimised . "
The presence of companies like Shell in the Niger-Delta has led to extreme environmental issues in the Niger Delta . Many pipelines in the Niger-Delta owned by Shell are old and corroded . Shell has acknowledged its responsibility for keeping the pipelines new but has also denied responsibility for environmental causes . This has led to mass protests from the Niger-Delta inhabitants and Amnesty International against Shell and Friends of the Earth Netherlands . It has also led to action plans to boycott Shell by environmental groups , and human rights groups . In January 2013 , a Dutch court rejected four out of five allegations brought against the firm over oil pollution in the Niger Delta but found a subsidiary guilty of one case of pollution , ordering compensation to be paid to a Nigerian farmer .
Apart from being an ardent gamer Spielberg has had a long history of involvement in video games . He has been giving thanks to his games of his division DreamWorks Interactive most notable as Someone 's in the Kitchen with script written by Animaniacs ' Paul Rugg , Goosebumps : Escape from HorrorLand , The Neverhood ( all in 1996 ) , Skullmonkeys , Dilbert 's Desktop Games , Goosebumps : Attack of the Mutant ( all 1997 ) , Boombots ( 1999 ) , T'ai Fu : Wrath of the Tiger ( 1999 ) , and Clive Barker 's Undying ( 2001 ) . In 2005 the director signed with Electronic Arts to collaborate on three games including an action game and an award winning puzzle game for the Wii called Boom Blox ( and its 2009 sequel : Boom Blox Bash Party ) . Previously , he was involved in creating the scenario for the adventure game The Dig . In 1996 , Spielberg worked on and shot original footage for a movie-making simulation game called Steven Spielberg 's Director 's Chair . He is the creator of the Medal of Honor series by Electronic Arts . He is credited in the special thanks section of the 1998 video game Trespasser . In 2013 , Spielberg has announced he is collaborating with 343 Industries for a live-action TV show of Halo .
From the 1980s , mainstream sensibilities were reasserted and serialization became less common as the number of comics magazines decreased and many comics began to be published directly as albums . Smaller publishers such as L'Association that published longer works in non-traditional formats by auteur-istic creators also became common . Since the 1990s , mergers resulted in fewer large publishers , while smaller publishers proliferated . Sales overall continued to grow despite the trend towards a shrinking print market .
Classical immunology ties in with the fields of epidemiology and medicine . It studies the relationship between the body systems , pathogens , and immunity . The earliest written mention of immunity can be traced back to the plague of Athens in 430 BCE . Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time . Many other ancient societies have references to this phenomenon , but it was not until the 19th and 20th centuries before the concept developed into scientific theory .
Often , the migration route of a long-distance migrator bird does n't follow a straight line between breeding and wintering grounds . Rather , it could follow an hooked or arched line , with detours around geographical barriers . For most land-birds , such barriers could consist in seas , large water bodies or high mountain ranges , because of the lack of stopover or feeding sites , or the lack of thermal columns for broad-winged birds .
In 2005 , Beyoncé teamed up with House of Brands , a shoe company , to produce a range of footwear for House of Deréon . In January 2008 , Starwave Mobile launched Beyoncé Fashion Diva , a " high-style " mobile game with a social networking component , featuring the House of Deréon collection . In July 2009 , Beyoncé and her mother launched a new junior apparel label , Sasha Fierce for Deréon , for back-to-school selling . The collection included sportswear , outerwear , handbags , footwear , eyewear , lingerie and jewelry . It was available at department stores including Macy 's and Dillard 's , and specialty stores Jimmy Jazz and Against All Odds . On May 27 , 2010 , Beyoncé teamed up with clothing store C & A to launch Deréon by Beyoncé at their stores in Brazil . The collection included tailored blazers with padded shoulders , little black dresses , embroidered tops and shirts and bandage dresses .
Starting in 1940 ( 18 months before Pearl Harbor ) , the nation mobilized , giving high priority to air power . American involvement in World War II in 1940–41 was limited to providing war material and financial support to Britain , the Soviet Union , and the Republic of China . The U.S. entered officially on 8 December 1941 following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Hawaii . Japanese forces soon seized American , Dutch , and British possessions across the Pacific and Southeast Asia , except for Australia , which became a main American forward base along with Hawaii .
Tacitus wrote in his Germania : Germania 9.6 : Ceterum nec cohibere parietibus deos neque in ullam humani oris speciem adsimulare ex magnitudine caelestium arbitrator – " The Germans , however , do not consider it consistent with the grandeur of celestial beings to confine the gods within walls , or to liken them to the form of any human countenance . " Germania 40 : mox vehiculum et vestis et , si credere velis , numen ipsum secreto lacu abluitur – " Afterwards the car , the vestments , and , if you like to believe it , the divinity herself , are purified in a secret lake . "
The Central Bank of Liberia is responsible for printing and maintaining the Liberian dollar , which is the primary form of currency in Liberia . Liberia is one of the world 's poorest countries , with a formal employment rate of 15 % . GDP per capita peaked in 1980 at US $ 496 , when it was comparable to Egypt 's ( at the time ) . In 2011 , the country 's nominal GDP was US $ 1.154 billion , while nominal GDP per capita stood at US $ 297 , the third-lowest in the world . Historically , the Liberian economy has depended heavily on foreign aid , foreign direct investment and exports of natural resources such as iron ore , rubber and timber .
Yugoslavia had a liberal travel policy permitting foreigners to freely travel through the country and its citizens to travel worldwide , whereas it was limited by most Communist countries . A number [ quantify ] of Yugoslav citizens worked throughout Western Europe . Tito met many world leaders during his rule , such as Soviet rulers Joseph Stalin , Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev ; Egypt 's Gamal Abdel Nasser , Indian politicians Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi ; British Prime Ministers Winston Churchill , James Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher ; U.S. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower , John F. Kennedy , Richard Nixon , Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter ; other political leaders , dignitaries and heads of state that Tito met at least once in his lifetime included Che Guevara , Fidel Castro , Yasser Arafat , Willy Brandt , Helmut Schmidt , Georges Pompidou , Queen Elizabeth II , Hua Guofeng , Kim Il Sung , Sukarno , Sheikh Mujibur Rahman , Suharto , Idi Amin , Haile Selassie , Kenneth Kaunda , Gaddafi , Erich Honecker , Nicolae Ceaușescu , János Kádár and Urho Kekkonen . He also met numerous celebrities .
During the 1950s and 1960s , FBI officials became increasingly concerned about the influence of civil rights leaders , whom they believed had communist ties or were unduly influenced by them . In 1956 , for example , Hoover sent an open letter denouncing Dr. T.R.M . Howard , a civil rights leader , surgeon , and wealthy entrepreneur in Mississippi who had criticized FBI inaction in solving recent murders of George W. Lee , Emmett Till , and other blacks in the South . The FBI carried out controversial domestic surveillance in an operation it called the COINTELPRO , which was short for " COunter-INTELligence PROgram . " It was to investigate and disrupt the activities of dissident political organizations within the United States , including both militant and non-violent organizations . Among its targets was the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , a leading civil rights organization with clergy leadership .
The best-known medieval Chinese name for Tibet is Tubo ( Chinese : 吐蕃 also written as 土蕃 or 土番 ; pinyin : Tǔbō or Tǔfān ) . This name first appears in Chinese characters as 土番 in the 7th century ( Li Tai ) and as 吐蕃 in the 10th-century ( Old Book of Tang describing 608–609 emissaries from Tibetan King Namri Songtsen to Emperor Yang of Sui ) . In the Middle Chinese spoken during that period , as reconstructed by William H. Baxter , 土番 was pronounced thux-phjon and 吐蕃 was pronounced thux-pjon ( with the x representing tone ) .
The group 's second LP , Queen II , was released in 1974 , and features rock photographer Mick Rock 's iconic image of the band on the cover . This image would be used as the basis for the 1975 " Bohemian Rhapsody " music video production . The album reached number five on the British album chart and became the first Queen album to chart in the UK . The Freddie Mercury-written lead single " Seven Seas of Rhye " reached number ten in the UK , giving the band their first hit . The album is the first real testament to the band 's distinctive layered sound , and features long complex instrumental passages , fantasy-themed lyrics , and musical virtuosity . Aside from its only single , the album also included the song " The March of the Black Queen " , a six-minute epic which lacks a chorus . The Daily Vault described the number as " menacing " . Critical reaction was mixed ; the Winnipeg Free Press , while praising the band 's debut album , described Queen II as a " over-produced monstrosity " . Allmusic has described the album as a favourite among the band 's hardcore fans , and it is the first of three Queen albums to feature in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .
The county has a long tradition of supplying freestone and building stone . Quarries at Doulting supplied freestone used in the construction of Wells Cathedral . Bath stone is also widely used . Ralph Allen promoted its use in the early 18th century , as did Hans Price in the 19th century , but it was used long before then . It was mined underground at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines , and as a result of cutting the Box Tunnel , at locations in Wiltshire such as Box . Bath stone is still used on a reduced scale today , but more often as a cladding rather than a structural material . Further south , Hamstone is the colloquial name given to stone from Ham Hill , which is also widely used in the construction industry . Blue Lias has been used locally as a building stone and as a raw material for lime mortar and Portland cement . Until the 1960s , Puriton had Blue Lias stone quarries , as did several other Polden villages . Its quarries also supplied a cement factory at Dunball , adjacent to the King 's Sedgemoor Drain . Its derelict , early 20th century remains , was removed when the M5 motorway was constructed in the mid-1970s . Since the 1920s , the county has supplied aggregates . Foster Yeoman is Europe 's large supplier of limestone aggregates , with quarries at Merehead Quarry . It has a dedicated railway operation , Mendip Rail , which is used to transport aggregates by rail from a group of Mendip quarries .
London has numerous venues for rock and pop concerts , including the world 's busiest arena the o2 arena and other large arenas such as Earls Court , Wembley Arena , as well as many mid-sized venues , such as Brixton Academy , the Hammersmith Apollo and the Shepherd 's Bush Empire . Several music festivals , including the Wireless Festival , South West Four , Lovebox , and Hyde Park 's British Summer Time are all held in London . The city is home to the first and original Hard Rock Cafe and the Abbey Road Studios where The Beatles recorded many of their hits . In the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s , musicians and groups like Elton John , Pink Floyd , David Bowie , Queen , The Kinks , The Rolling Stones , The Who , Eric Clapton , Led Zeppelin , The Small Faces , Iron Maiden , Fleetwood Mac , Elvis Costello , Cat Stevens , The Police , The Cure , Madness , The Jam , Dusty Springfield , Phil Collins , Rod Stewart and Sade , derived their sound from the streets and rhythms vibrating through London .
In December 1993 , the Famicom received a similar redesign . It also loads cartridges through a covered slot on the top of the unit and uses non-hardwired controllers . Because HVC-101 used composite video output instead of being RF only like the HVC-001 , Nintendo marketed the newer model as the AV Famicom ( AV仕様ファミコン , Eibui Shiyō Famikon ? ) . Since the new controllers do n't have microphones on them like the second controller on the original console , certain games such as the Disk System version of The Legend of Zelda and Raid on Bungeling Bay will have certain tricks that can not be replicated when played on an HVC-101 Famicom without a modded controller . However , the HVC-101 Famicom is compatible with most NES controllers due to having the same controller port . Nintendo had also released a 3D graphic capable headset . However , this peripheral was never released outside Japan . [ citation needed ]
Classical statistical mechanics requires the existence of h ( but does not define its value ) . Eventually , following upon Planck 's discovery , it was recognized that physical action can not take on an arbitrary value . Instead , it must be some multiple of a very small quantity , the " quantum of action " , now called the Planck constant . Classical physics can not explain this fact . In many cases , such as for monochromatic light or for atoms , this quantum of action also implies that only certain energy levels are allowed , and values in between are forbidden .
The Warnerke Standard Sensitometer consisted of a frame holding an opaque screen with an array of typically 25 numbered , gradually pigmented squares brought into contact with the photographic plate during a timed test exposure under a phosphorescent tablet excited before by the light of a burning Magnesium ribbon . The speed of the emulsion was then expressed in 'degrees ' Warnerke ( sometimes seen as Warn . or °W . ) corresponding with the last number visible on the exposed plate after development and fixation . Each number represented an increase of 1/3 in speed , typical plate speeds were between 10° and 25° Warnerke at the time .
The tourism industry began in the early 19th century when foreigners visited the Alps , traveled to the bases of the mountains to enjoy the scenery , and stayed at the spa-resorts . Large hotels were built during the Belle Époque ; cog-railways , built early in the 20th century , brought tourists to ever higher elevations , with the Jungfraubahn terminating at the Jungfraujoch , well above the eternal snow-line , after going through a tunnel in Eiger . During this period winter sports were slowly introduced : in 1882 the first figure skating championship was held in St. Moritz , and downhill skiing became a popular sport with English visitors early in the 20th century , as the first ski-lift was installed in 1908 above Grindelwald .
Hayek received new attention in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of conservative governments in the United States , United Kingdom , and Canada . After winning the United Kingdom general election , 1979 , Margaret Thatcher appointed Keith Joseph , the director of the Hayekian Centre for Policy Studies , as her secretary of state for industry in an effort to redirect parliament 's economic strategies . Likewise , David Stockman , Ronald Reagan 's most influential financial official in 1981 was an acknowledged follower of Hayek .
There are 29 isotopes of copper . 63Cu and 65Cu are stable , with 63Cu comprising approximately 69 % of naturally occurring copper ; they both have a spin of 3⁄2 . The other isotopes are radioactive , with the most stable being 67Cu with a half-life of 61.83 hours . Seven metastable isotopes have been characterized , with 68mCu the longest-lived with a half-life of 3.8 minutes . Isotopes with a mass number above 64 decay by β− , whereas those with a mass number below 64 decay by β+ . 64Cu , which has a half-life of 12.7 hours , decays both ways .
In 1939 the Regierungsbezirk Zichenau was annexed by Germany and incorporated into East Prussia . Parts of it were transferred to other regions , e.g . Suwałki to Regierungsbezirk Gumbinnen and Soldau to Regierungsbezirk Allenstein . Despite Nazi propaganda presenting all of the regions annexed as possessing significant German populations that wanted reunification with Germany , the Reich 's statistics of late 1939 show that only 31,000 out of 994,092 people in this territory were ethnic Germans .

During the English Civil War the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause . After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642 culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green , London was surrounded by defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication . The lines were built by an up to 20,000 people , and were completed in under two months . The fortifications failed their only test when the New Model Army entered London in 1647 , and they were levelled by Parliament the same year .
However , there is significant disagreement within Orthodox Judaism , particularly between Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism , about the extent and circumstances under which the proper application of Halakha should be re-examined as a result of changing realities . As a general rule , Haredi Jews believe that when at all possible the law should be maintained as it was understood by their authorities at the haskalah , believing that it had never changed . Modern Orthodox authorities are more willing to assume that under scrupulous examination , identical principles may lead to different applications in the context of modern life . To the Orthodox Jew , halakha is a guide , God 's Law , governing the structure of daily life from the moment he or she wakes up to the moment he goes to sleep . It includes codes of behaviour applicable to a broad range of circumstances ( and many hypothetical ones ) . There are though a number of halakhic meta-principles that guide the halakhic process and in an instance of opposition between a specific halakha and a meta-principle , the meta-principle often wins out . Examples of Halakhic Meta-Principles are : " Deracheha Darchei Noam " - the ways of Torah are pleasant , " Kavod Habriyot " - basic respect for human beings , " Pikuach Nefesh " - the sanctity of human life .
Wine was considered the basic drink , consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite inexpensive . Cato the Elder once advised cutting his rations in half to conserve wine for the workforce . Many types of drinks involving grapes and honey were consumed as well . Drinking on an empty stomach was regarded as boorish and a sure sign for alcoholism , the debilitating physical and psychological effects of which were known to the Romans . An accurate accusation of being an alcoholic was an effective way to discredit political rivals . Prominent Roman alcoholics included Mark Antony , and Cicero 's own son Marcus ( Cicero Minor ) . Even Cato the Younger was known to be a heavy drinker . [ citation needed ]
Portuguese cinema has a long tradition , reaching back to the birth of the medium in the late 19th century . Portuguese film directors such as Arthur Duarte , António Lopes Ribeiro , António Reis , Pedro Costa , Manoel de Oliveira , João César Monteiro , António-Pedro Vasconcelos , Fernando Lopes , João Botelho and Leonel Vieira , are among those that gained notability . Noted Portuguese film actors include Joaquim de Almeida , Daniela Ruah , Maria de Medeiros , Diogo Infante , Soraia Chaves , Ribeirinho , Lúcia Moniz , and Diogo Morgado .
During most of the war , the UN navies patrolled the west and east coasts of North Korea , sinking supply and ammunition ships and denying the North Koreans the ability to resupply from the sea . Aside from very occasional gunfire from North Korean shore batteries , the main threat to United States and UN navy ships was from magnetic mines . During the war , five U.S. Navy ships were lost to mines : two minesweepers , two minesweeper escorts , and one ocean tug . Mines and gunfire from North Korean coastal artillery damaged another 87 U.S. warships , resulting in slight to moderate damage .
In 1906 , precipitation hardening alloys were discovered by Alfred Wilm . Precipitation hardening alloys , such as certain alloys of aluminium , titanium , and copper , are heat-treatable alloys that soften when quenched ( cooled quickly ) , and then harden over time . After quenching a ternary alloy of aluminium , copper , and magnesium , Wilm discovered that the alloy increased in hardness when left to age at room temperature . Although an explanation for the phenomenon was not provided until 1919 , duralumin was one of the first " age hardening " alloys to be used , and was soon followed by many others . Because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight , these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry , including the construction of modern aircraft .
In terms of sexual identity , adolescence is when most gay/lesbian and transgender adolescents begin to recognize and make sense of their feelings . Many adolescents may choose to come out during this period of their life once an identity has been formed ; many others may go through a period of questioning or denial , which can include experimentation with both homosexual and heterosexual experiences . A study of 194 lesbian , gay , and bisexual youths under the age of 21 found that having an awareness of one 's sexual orientation occurred , on average , around age 10 , but the process of coming out to peers and adults occurred around age 16 and 17 , respectively . Coming to terms with and creating a positive LGBT identity can be difficult for some youth for a variety of reasons . Peer pressure is a large factor when youth who are questioning their sexuality or gender identity are surrounded by heteronormative peers and can cause great distress due to a feeling of being different from everyone else . While coming out can also foster better psychological adjustment , the risks associated are real . Indeed , coming out in the midst of a heteronormative peer environment often comes with the risk of ostracism , hurtful jokes , and even violence . Because of this , statistically the suicide rate amongst LGBT adolescents is up to four times higher than that of their heterosexual peers due to bullying and rejection from peers or family members .
Florey and Chain succeeded in purifying the first penicillin , penicillin G , in 1942 , but it did not become widely available outside the Allied military before 1945 . Later , Norman Heatley developed the back extraction technique for efficiently purifying penicillin in bulk . The chemical structure of penicillin was determined by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1945 . Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans . Furthermore , its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus , unlike the synthetic sulfonamides . The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented , and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety . For their successful development of penicillin , which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself , as a therapeutic drug , Ernst Chain and Howard Florey shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Fleming . Florey credited Dubos with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds , which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived Florey 's research in penicillin .
The eastern shoreline of Funafuti Lagoon was modified during World War II when the airfield ( what is now Funafuti International Airport ) was constructed . The coral base of the atoll was used as fill to create the runway . The resulting borrow pits impacted the fresh-water aquifer . In the low areas of Funafuti the sea water can be seen bubbling up through the porous coral rock to form pools with each high tide . Since 1994 a project has been in development to assess the environmental impact of transporting sand from the lagoon to fill all the borrow pits and low-lying areas on Fongafale . In 2014 the Tuvalu Borrow Pits Remediation ( BPR ) project was approved in order to fill 10 borrow pits , leaving Tafua Pond , which is a natural pond . The New Zealand Government funded the BPR project . The project was carried out in 2015 with 365,000 sqm of sand being dredged from the lagoon to fill the holes and improve living conditions on the island . This project increase the usable land space on Fongafale by eight per cent .
In the 20th century , as Beijing , Shanghai , Nanjing , and Wuhan had all been occupied by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War , the capital of the Republic of China had been temporary relocated to Chongqing , then a major city in Sichuan . An enduring legacy of this move is that nearby inland provinces , such as Shaanxi , Gansu , and Guizhou , which previously never had modern Western-style universities , began to be developed in this regard . The difficulty of accessing the region overland from the eastern part of China and the foggy climate hindering the accuracy of Japanese bombing of the Sichuan Basin , made the region the stronghold of Chiang Kai-Shek 's Kuomintang government during 1938-45 , and led to the Bombing of Chongqing .
The German states proclaimed their union as the German Empire under the Prussian king , Wilhelm I , uniting Germany as a nation-state . The Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871 gave Germany most of Alsace and some parts of Lorraine , which became the Imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine ( Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen ) .The German conquest of France and the unification of Germany upset the European balance of power , that had existed since the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and Otto von Bismarck maintained great authority in international affairs for two decades . French determination to regain Alsace-Lorraine and fear of another Franco-German war , along with British apprehension about the balance of power , became factors in the causes of World War I .
To make pulp from wood , a chemical pulping process separates lignin from cellulose fibres . This is accomplished by dissolving lignin in a cooking liquor , so that it may be washed from the cellulose ; this preserves the length of the cellulose fibres . Paper made from chemical pulps are also known as wood-free papers–not to be confused with tree-free paper ; this is because they do not contain lignin , which deteriorates over time . The pulp can also be bleached to produce white paper , but this consumes 5 % of the fibres ; chemical pulping processes are not used to make paper made from cotton , which is already 90 % cellulose .
During the 19th century , an important producer of art was the Academia de San Carlos ( San Carlos Art Academy ) , founded during colonial times , and which later became the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas ( the National School of Arts ) including painting , sculpture and graphic design , one of UNAM 's art schools . Many of the works produced by the students and faculty of that time are now displayed in the Museo Nacional de San Carlos ( National Museum of San Carlos ) . One of the students , José María Velasco , is considered one of the greatest Mexican landscape painters of the 19th century . Porfirio Díaz 's regime sponsored arts , especially those that followed the French school . Popular arts in the form of cartoons and illustrations flourished , e.g . those of José Guadalupe Posada and Manuel Manilla . The permanent collection of the San Carlos Museum also includes paintings by European masters such as Rembrandt , Velázquez , Murillo , and Rubens .
In September 2003 , a new type of blue LED was demonstrated by Cree that consumes 24 mW at 20 milliamperes ( mA ) . This produced a commercially packaged white light giving 65 lm/W at 20 mA , becoming the brightest white LED commercially available at the time , and more than four times as efficient as standard incandescents . In 2006 , they demonstrated a prototype with a record white LED luminous efficacy of 131 lm/W at 20 mA . Nichia Corporation has developed a white LED with luminous efficacy of 150 lm/W at a forward current of 20 mA . Cree 's XLamp XM-L LEDs , commercially available in 2011 , produce 100 lm/W at their full power of 10 W , and up to 160 lm/W at around 2 W input power . In 2012 , Cree announced a white LED giving 254 lm/W , and 303 lm/W in March 2014 . Practical general lighting needs high-power LEDs , of one watt or more . Typical operating currents for such devices begin at 350 mA .
On runways , green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing , while red lights indicate the end of the runway . Runway edge lighting consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway , indicating the edge . Some airports have more complicated lighting on the runways including lights that run down the centerline of the runway and lights that help indicate the approach ( an approach lighting system , or ALS ) . Low-traffic airports may use pilot controlled lighting to save electricity and staffing costs .
Hindu philosophy refers to a group of darśanas ( philosophies , world views , teachings ) that emerged in ancient India . The mainstream Hindu philosophy includes six systems ( ṣaḍdarśana ) – Samkhya , Yoga , Nyaya , Vaisheshika , Mimamsa and Vedanta . These are also called the Astika ( orthodox ) philosophical traditions and are those that accept the Vedas as authoritative , important source of knowledge . [ note 1 ] [ note 2 ] Ancient and medieval India was also the source of philosophies that share philosophical concepts but rejected the Vedas , and these have been called nāstika ( heterodox or non-orthodox ) Indian philosophies . Nāstika Indian philosophies include Buddhism , Jainism , Cārvāka , Ājīvika , and others .
According to Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli , Beyoncé uses different fashion styles to work with her music while performing . Her mother co-wrote a book , published in 2002 , titled Destiny 's Style an account of how fashion had an impact on the trio 's success . The B'Day Anthology Video Album showed many instances of fashion-oriented footage , depicting classic to contemporary wardrobe styles . In 2007 , Beyoncé was featured on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue , becoming the second African American woman after Tyra Banks , and People magazine recognized Beyoncé as the best-dressed celebrity .
Later , the public bars gradually improved until sometimes almost the only difference was in the prices , so that customers could choose between economy and exclusivity ( or youth and age , or a jukebox or dartboard ) . [ citation needed ] With the blurring of class divisions in the 1960s and 1970s , [ citation needed ] the distinction between the saloon and the public bar was often seen as archaic , [ citation needed ] and was frequently abolished , usually by the removal of the dividing wall or partition . [ citation needed ] While the names of saloon and public bar may still be seen on the doors of pubs , the prices ( and often the standard of furnishings and decoration ) are the same throughout the premises , and many pubs now comprise one large room . However the modern importance of dining in pubs encourages some establishments to maintain distinct rooms or areas .
Another example of the persecution of heretics under Protestant rule was the execution of the Boston martyrs in 1659 , 1660 , and 1661 . These executions resulted from the actions of the Anglican Puritans , who at that time wielded political as well as ecclesiastic control in the Massachusetts Bay Colony . At the time , the colony leaders were apparently hoping to achieve their vision of a " purer absolute theocracy " within their colony . [ citation needed ] As such , they perceived the teachings and practices of the rival Quaker sect as heretical , even to the point where laws were passed and executions were performed with the aim of ridding their colony of such perceived " heresies " . [ citation needed ] It should be noticed that the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox communions generally regard the Puritans themselves as having been heterodox or heretical .
iPods have won several awards ranging from engineering excellence , [ not in citation given ] to most innovative audio product , to fourth best computer product of 2006. iPods often receive favorable reviews ; scoring on looks , clean design , and ease of use . PC World says that iPod line has " altered the landscape for portable audio players " . Several industries are modifying their products to work better with both the iPod line and the AAC audio format . Examples include CD copy-protection schemes , and mobile phones , such as phones from Sony Ericsson and Nokia , which play AAC files rather than WMA .
Between 1993 and 1996 , the FBI increased its counter-terrorism role in the wake of the first 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City , New York ; the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma ; and the arrest of the Unabomber in 1996 . Technological innovation and the skills of FBI Laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted . Justice Department investigations into the FBI 's roles in the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents were found to be obstructed by agents within the Bureau . During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta , Georgia , the FBI was criticized for its investigation of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing . It has settled a dispute with Richard Jewell , who was a private security guard at the venue , along with some media organizations , in regard to the leaking of his name during the investigation .
There are two major sports centers in Nanjing , Wutaishan Sports Center and Nanjing Olympic Sports Center . Both of these two are comprehensive sports centers , including stadium , gymnasium , natatorium , tennis court , etc . Wutaishan Sports Center was established in 1952 and it was one of the oldest and most advanced stadiums in early time of People 's Republic of China .
It was decided to focus on bombing Britain 's industrial cities in daylight to begin with . The main focus of the bombing operations was against the city of London . The first major raid in this regard took place on 7 September . On 15 September , on a date known as the Battle of Britain Day , a large-scale raid was launched in daylight , but suffered significant loss for no lasting gain . Although there were a few large air battles fought in daylight later in the month and into October , the Luftwaffe switched its main effort to night attacks in order to reduce losses . This became official policy on 7 October . The air campaign soon got underway against London and other British cities . However , the Luftwaffe faced limitations . Its aircraft—Dornier Do 17 , Junkers Ju 88 , and Heinkel He 111s—were capable of carrying out strategic missions , but were incapable of doing greater damage because of bomb-load limitations . The Luftwaffe 's decision in the interwar period to concentrate on medium bombers can be attributed to several reasons : Hitler did not intend or foresee a war with Britain in 1939 ; the OKL believed a medium bomber could carry out strategic missions just as well as a heavy bomber force ; and Germany did not possess the resources or technical ability to produce four-engined bombers before the war .
From 1938 until 1995 , the U.S. Supreme Court did not invalidate any federal statute as exceeding Congress ' power under the Commerce Clause . Most actions by the federal government can find some legal support among the express powers , such as the Commerce Clause , whose applicability has been narrowed by the Supreme Court in recent years . In 1995 the Supreme Court rejected the Gun-Free School Zones Act in the Lopez decision , and also rejected the civil remedy portion of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 in the United States v. Morrison decision . Recently , the Commerce Clause was interpreted to include marijuana laws in the Gonzales v. Raich decision .
The League of American Bicyclists gave Tucson a gold rating for bicycle friendliness in late April 2007 . Tucson hosts the largest perimeter cycling event in the United States . The ride called " El Tour de Tucson " happens in November on the Saturday before Thanksgiving . El Tour de Tucson produced and promoted by Perimeter Bicycling has as many as 10,000 participants from all over the world , annually . Tucson is one of only nine cities in the U.S. to receive a gold rating or higher for cycling friendliness from the League of American Bicyclists . The city is known for its winter cycling opportunities . Both road and mountain biking are popular in and around Tucson with trail areas including Starr Pass and Fantasy Island .
At a certain temperature , ( usually between 1,500 °F ( 820 °C ) and 1,600 °F ( 870 °C ) , depending on carbon content ) , the base metal of steel undergoes a change in the arrangement of the atoms in its crystal matrix , called allotropy . This allows the small carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal , diffusing into the iron matrix . When this happens , the carbon atoms are said to be in solution , or mixed with the iron , forming a single , homogeneous , crystalline phase called austenite . If the steel is cooled slowly , the iron will gradually change into its low temperature allotrope . When this happens the carbon atoms will no longer be soluble with the iron , and will be forced to precipitate out of solution , nucleating into the spaces between the crystals . The steel then becomes heterogeneous , being formed of two phases ; the carbon ( carbide ) phase cementite , and ferrite . This type of heat treatment produces steel that is rather soft and bendable . However , if the steel is cooled quickly the carbon atoms will not have time to precipitate . When rapidly cooled , a diffusionless ( martensite ) transformation occurs , in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution . This causes the iron crystals to deform intrinsically when the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state , making it very hard and brittle .
After the Partisans managed to endure and avoid these intense Axis attacks between January and June 1943 , and the extent of Chetnik collaboration became evident , Allied leaders switched their support from Draža Mihailović to Tito . King Peter II , American President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill joined Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin in officially recognising Tito and the Partisans at the Tehran Conference . This resulted in Allied aid being parachuted behind Axis lines to assist the Partisans . On 17 June 1944 on the Dalmatian island of Vis , the Treaty of Vis ( Viški sporazum ) was signed in an attempt to merge Tito 's government ( the AVNOJ ) with the government in exile of King Peter II . The Balkan Air Force was formed in June 1944 to control operations that were mainly aimed at aiding his forces .
There are three main chemical pulping processes : the sulfite process dates back to the 1840s and it was the dominant method extent before the second world war . The kraft process , invented in the 1870s and first used in the 1890s , is now the most commonly practiced strategy , one of its advantages is the chemical reaction with lignin , that produces heat , which can be used to run a generator . Most pulping operations using the kraft process are net contributors to the electricity grid or use the electricity to run an adjacent paper mill . Another advantage is that this process recovers and reuses all inorganic chemical reagents . Soda pulping is another specialty process used to pulp straws , bagasse and hardwoods with high silicate content .
By developing commercial centres and routes , encouraging people to extend the area of cultivated land in the country and international trade through its dominions , the state performed basic economic functions in the Empire . But in all this the financial and political interests of the state were dominant . Within the social and political system they were living in Ottoman administrators could not have comprehended or seen the desirability of the dynamics and principles of the capitalist and mercantile economies developing in Western Europe .
Aristotle noted that cranes traveled from the steppes of Scythia to marshes at the headwaters of the Nile . Pliny the Elder , in his Historia Naturalis , repeats Aristotle 's observations .
Starting in the 1980s , he travelled with his all-female Amazonian Guard , who were allegedly sworn to a life of celibacy . However , according to psychologist Seham Sergewa , after the civil war several of the guards told her they had been pressured into joining and raped by Gaddafi and senior officials . He hired several Ukrainian nurses to care for him and his family 's health , and traveled everywhere with his trusted Ukrainian nurse Halyna Kolotnytska . Kolotnytska 's daughter denied the suggestion that the relationship was anything but professional .
In 1883 , salt water taffy was conceived in Atlantic City by David Bradley . The traditional story is that Bradley 's shop was flooded after a major storm , soaking his taffy with salty Atlantic Ocean water . He sold some " salt water taffy " to a girl , who proudly walked down to the beach to show her friends . Bradley 's mother was in the back of the store when the sale was made , and loved the name , and so salt water taffy was born .
Japanese seismologist Yuji Yagi at the University of Tsukuba said that the earthquake occurred in two stages : " The 155-mile Longmenshan Fault tore in two sections , the first one ripping about seven yards , followed by a second one that sheared four yards . " His data also showed that the earthquake lasted about two minutes and released 30 times the energy of the Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995 in Japan , which killed over 6,000 people . He pointed out that the shallowness of the epicenter and the density of population greatly increased the severity of the earthquake . Teruyuki Kato , a seismologist at the University of Tokyo , said that the seismic waves of the quake traveled a long distance without losing their power because of the firmness of the terrain in central China . According to reports from Chengdu , the capital of Sichuan province , the earthquake tremors lasted for " about two or three minutes " .
Though the music varied widely between regions and artists , the post-punk movement has been characterized by its " conceptual assault " on rock conventions and rejection of aesthetics perceived of as traditionalist , hegemonic or rockist in favor of experimentation with production techniques and non-rock musical styles such as dub , electronic music , disco , noise , jazz , krautrock , world music and the avant-garde . While post-punk musicians often avoided or intentionally obscured conventional influences , previous musical styles did serve as touchstones for the movement , including particular brands of glam , art rock and " [ the ] dark undercurrent of '60s music " . [ nb 1 ] According to Reynolds , artists once again approached the studio as an instrument , using new recording methods and pursuing novel sonic territories . Author Matthew Bannister wrote that post-punk artists rejected the high cultural references of 1960s rock artists like the Beatles and Bob Dylan as well as paradigms that defined " rock as progressive , as art , as 'sterile ' studio perfectionism ... by adopting an avant-garde aesthetic " .
The motor centers of reptiles react to sensory cues of vision , sound , touch , chemical , gravity , and motion with pre-set body movements and programmed postures . With the arrival of night-active mammals , smell replaced vision as the dominant sense , and a different way of responding arose from the olfactory sense , which is proposed to have developed into mammalian emotion and emotional memory . The mammalian brain invested heavily in olfaction to succeed at night as reptiles slept—one explanation for why olfactory lobes in mammalian brains are proportionally larger than in the reptiles . These odor pathways gradually formed the neural blueprint for what was later to become our limbic brain .
Arnold Schwarzenegger has been involved with the Special Olympics for many years after they were founded by his ex-mother-in-law , Eunice Kennedy Shriver . In 2007 , Schwarzenegger was the official spokesperson for the Special Olympics which were held in Shanghai , China . Schwarzenegger believes that quality school opportunities should be made available to children who might not normally be able to access them . In 1995 , he founded the Inner City Games Foundation ( ICG ) which provides cultural , educational and community enrichment programming to youth . ICG is active in 15 cities around the country and serves over 250,000 children in over 400 schools countrywide . He has also been involved with After-School All-Stars , and founded the Los Angeles branch in 2002 . ASAS is an after school program provider , educating youth about health , fitness and nutrition .
Bush focused his campaign on national security , presenting himself as a decisive leader and contrasted Kerry as a " flip-flopper . " This strategy was designed to convey to American voters the idea that Bush could be trusted to be tough on terrorism while Kerry would be " uncertain in the face of danger . " Bush ( just as his father did with Dukakis in the 1988 election ) also sought to portray Kerry as a " Massachusetts liberal " who was out of touch with mainstream Americans . One of Kerry 's slogans was " Stronger at home , respected in the world . " This advanced the suggestion that Kerry would pay more attention to domestic concerns ; it also encapsulated Kerry 's contention that Bush had alienated American allies by his foreign policy .
U.S. President Barack Obama has rarely used the term , but in his inaugural address on 20 January 2009 , he stated " Our nation is at war , against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred . " In March 2009 the Defense Department officially changed the name of operations from " Global War on Terror " to " Overseas Contingency Operation " ( OCO ) . In March 2009 , the Obama administration requested that Pentagon staff members avoid use of the term , instead using " Overseas Contingency Operation " . Basic objectives of the Bush administration " war on terror " , such as targeting al Qaeda and building international counterterrorism alliances , remain in place . In December 2012 , Jeh Johnson , the General Counsel of the Department of Defense , stated that the military fight will be replaced by a law enforcement operation when speaking at Oxford University , predicting that al Qaeda will be so weakened to be ineffective , and has been " effectively destroyed " , and thus the conflict will not be an armed conflict under international law . In May 2013 , Obama stated that the goal is " to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America " ; which coincided with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget having changed the wording from " Overseas Contingency Operations " to " Countering Violent Extremism " in 2010 .
The ultimate substantive legacy of Principia Mathematica is mixed . It is generally accepted that Kurt Gödel 's incompleteness theorem of 1931 definitively demonstrated that for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics , there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them , and hence that Principia Mathematica could never achieve its aims . However , Gödel could not have come to this conclusion without Whitehead and Russell 's book . In this way , Principia Mathematica 's legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals . But beyond this somewhat ironic legacy , the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic , epistemology , and metaphysics .
Public and private schools in Hyderabad are governed by the Central Board of Secondary Education and follow a " 10+2+3 " plan . About two-thirds of pupils attend privately run institutions . Languages of instruction include English , Hindi , Telugu and Urdu . Depending on the institution , students are required to sit the Secondary School Certificate or the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education . After completing secondary education , students enroll in schools or junior colleges with a higher secondary facility . Admission to professional graduation colleges in Hyderabad , many of which are affiliated with either Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad ( JNTUH ) or Osmania University ( OU ) , is through the Engineering Agricultural and Medical Common Entrance Test ( EAM-CET ) .
The Napoleonic Wars were the cause of the final dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire , and ultimately the cause for the quest for a German nation state in 19th-century German nationalism . After the Congress of Vienna , Austria and Prussia emerged as two competitors . Austria , trying to remain the dominant power in Central Europe , led the way in the terms of the Congress of Vienna . The Congress of Vienna was essentially conservative , assuring that little would change in Europe and preventing Germany from uniting . These terms came to a sudden halt following the Revolutions of 1848 and the Crimean War in 1856 , paving the way for German unification in the 1860s . By the 1820s , large numbers of Jewish German women had intermarried with Christian German men and had converted to Christianity . Jewish German Eduard Lasker was a prominent German nationalist figure who promoted the unification of Germany in the mid-19th century .
On January 13 , 1887 , the U , S . Government moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation . After a series of decisions and reversals , the Bell company won a decision in the Supreme Court , though a couple of the original claims from the lower court cases were left undecided . By the time that the trial wound its way through nine years of legal battles , the U.S. prosecuting attorney had died and the two Bell patents ( No . 174,465 dated March 7 , 1876 and No . 186,787 dated January 30 , 1877 ) were no longer in effect , although the presiding judges agreed to continue the proceedings due to the case 's importance as a " precedent " . With a change in administration and charges of conflict of interest ( on both sides ) arising from the original trial , the US Attorney General dropped the lawsuit on November 30 , 1897 leaving several issues undecided on the merits .
Asphalt/bitumen also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as " oil sands " in Alberta , Canada , and the similar " tar sands " in Utah , US . The Canadian province of Alberta has most of the world 's reserves of natural bitumen , in three huge deposits covering 142,000 square kilometres ( 55,000 sq mi ) , an area larger than England or New York state . These bituminous sands contain 166 billion barrels ( 26.4×10^9 m3 ) of commercially established oil reserves , giving Canada the third largest oil reserves in the world . and produce over 2.3 million barrels per day ( 370×10^3 m3/d ) of heavy crude oil and synthetic crude oil . Although historically it was used without refining to pave roads , nearly all of the bitumen is now used as raw material for oil refineries in Canada and the United States .
The Armed Forces are today funded by approximately $ 20.1 billion annually and are presently ranked 74th in size compared to the world 's other armed forces by number of total personnel , and 58th in terms of active personnel , standing at a strength of roughly 68,000 , plus 27,000 reservists , 5000 Rangers , and 19,000 supplementary reserves , bringing the total force to approximately 119,000 . The number of primary reserve personnel is expected to go up to 30,000 by 2020 , and the number of active to at least 70,000 . In addition , 5000 rangers and 19,000 supplementary personnel will be serving . If this happens the total strength would be around 124,000 . These individuals serve on numerous CF bases located in all regions of the country , and are governed by the Queen 's Regulations and Orders and the National Defence Act .
The latest study using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to humans and dogs together proved that dogs have same response to voices and use the same parts of the brain as humans to do so . This gives dogs the ability to recognize emotional human sounds , making them friendly social pets to humans .
Since the opening policy in 1979 , the Chinese department stores also develops swiftly along with the fast-growing economy . There are different department store groups dominating different regions . For example , INTIME department store has the biggest market presence in Zhejiang province , while Jinying department stores dominate Jiangsu Province . Besides , there are many other department store groups , such as Pacific , Parkson , Wangfujing，New World，etc. , many of them are expanding quickly by listing in the financial market .
In the subtractive color system , used in painting and color printing , green is created by a combination of yellow and blue , or yellow and cyan ; in the RGB color model , used on television and computer screens , it is one of the additive primary colors , along with red and blue , which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors . On the HSV color wheel , also known as the RGB color wheel , the complement of green is magenta ; that is , a color corresponding to an equal mixture of red and blue light ( one of the purples ) . On a traditional color wheel , based on subtractive color , the complementary color to green is considered to be red .
On the day of the abdication , the Oireachtas , the parliament of the Irish Free State , removed all direct mention of the monarch from the Irish constitution . The next day , it passed the External Relations Act , which gave the monarch limited authority ( strictly on the advice of the government ) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and to be involved in the making of foreign treaties . The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth .
In February 20 , 1988 , after a week of growing demonstrations in Stepanakert , capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast ( the Armenian majority area within Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic ) , the Regional Soviet voted to secede and join with the Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia . This local vote in a small , remote part of the Soviet Union made headlines around the world ; it was an unprecedented defiance of republic and national authorities . On February 22 , 1988 , in what became known as the " Askeran clash " , two Azerbaijanis were killed by Karabakh police . These deaths , announced on state radio , led to the Sumgait Pogrom . Between February 26 and March 1 , the city of Sumgait ( Azerbaijan ) saw violent anti-Armenian rioting during which 32 people were killed . The authorities totally lost control and occupied the city with paratroopers and tanks ; nearly all of the 14,000 Armenian residents of Sumgait fled .
Cockfighting is said to be the world 's oldest spectator sport and may have originated in Persia 6,000 years ago . Two mature males ( cocks or roosters ) are set to fight each other , and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed . Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour . The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians , Chinese , Greeks , and Romans , and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter . Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of cruelty to animals .
The cloth or fiber material used , resin material , and the cloth to resin ratio determine the laminate 's type designation ( FR-4 , CEM-1 , G-10 , etc . ) and therefore the characteristics of the laminate produced . Important characteristics are the level to which the laminate is fire retardant , the dielectric constant ( er ) , the loss factor ( tδ ) , the tensile strength , the shear strength , the glass transition temperature ( Tg ) , and the Z-axis expansion coefficient ( how much the thickness changes with temperature ) .
Both Roger Williams and John Clarke , his compatriot and coworker for religious freedom , are variously credited as founding the earliest Baptist church in North America . In 1639 , Williams established a Baptist church in Providence , Rhode Island , and Clarke began a Baptist church in Newport , Rhode Island . According to a Baptist historian who has researched the matter extensively , " There is much debate over the centuries as to whether the Providence or Newport church deserved the place of 'first ' Baptist congregation in America .

Schwarzenegger was born in Thal , a village bordering the city of Graz in Styria , Austria and christened Arnold Alois . His parents were Gustav Schwarzenegger ( August 17 , 1907 – December 13 , 1972 ) , and Aurelia Schwarzenegger ( née Jadrny ; July 29 , 1922 – August 2 , 1998 ) . Gustav was the local chief of police , and had served in World War II as a Hauptfeldwebel after voluntarily joining the Nazi Party in 1938 , though he was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria . He married Arnold 's mother on October 20 , 1945 ; – he was 38 , and she was 23 years old . According to Schwarzenegger , both of his parents were very strict : " Back then in Austria it was a very different world , if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents , the rod was not spared . " He grew up in a Roman Catholic family who attended Mass every Sunday .
The Mahayana sutras are a very broad genre of Buddhist scriptures that the Mahayana Buddhist tradition holds are original teachings of the Buddha . Some adherents of Mahayana accept both the early teachings ( including in this the Sarvastivada Abhidharma , which was criticized by Nagarjuna and is in fact opposed to early Buddhist thought ) and the Mahayana sutras as authentic teachings of Gautama Buddha , and claim they were designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual understanding .
The area near the border with Cameroon close to the coast is rich rainforest and part of the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests ecoregion , an important centre for biodiversity . It is habitat for the drill monkey , which is found in the wild only in this area and across the border in Cameroon . The areas surrounding Calabar , Cross River State , also in this forest , are believed to contain the world 's largest diversity of butterflies . The area of southern Nigeria between the Niger and the Cross Rivers has lost most of its forest because of development and harvesting by increased population , with it being replaced by grassland ( see Cross-Niger transition forests ) .
Sanskrit ( /ˈsænskrɪt/ ; Sanskrit : saṃskṛtam [ səmskr̩t̪əm ] or saṃskṛta , originally saṃskṛtā vāk , " refined speech " ) is the primary sacred language of Hinduism , a philosophical language in Buddhism , Hinduism , Sikhism and Jainism , and a literary language that was in use as a lingua franca in Greater India . It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan , originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European . Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand . As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists , Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies .
Many pesticides can be grouped into chemical families . Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines , organophosphates , and carbamates . Organochlorine hydrocarbons ( e.g. , DDT ) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes , cyclodiene compounds , and other related compounds . They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber , forcing the nerve to transmit continuously . Their toxicities vary greatly , but they have been phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate . :239–240 Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines . Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase , allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis . Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates , and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates . :136–137 Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates . Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides ( e.g . 2,4-D ) , triazines ( e.g. , atrazine ) , ureas ( e.g. , diuron ) , and Chloroacetanilides ( e.g. , alachlor ) . Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses . The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones , and grow cells without normal cell division , crushing the plant 's nutrient transport system . :300 Triazines interfere with photosynthesis . :335 Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families , including glyphosate .
On April 9 , 2007 , it was announced that Apple had sold its one-hundred millionth iPod , making it the biggest selling digital music player of all time . In April 2007 , Apple reported second quarter revenue of US $ 5.2 billion , of which 32 % was made from iPod sales . Apple and several industry analysts suggest that iPod users are likely to purchase other Apple products such as Mac computers .
Switzerland 's most important economic sector is manufacturing . Manufacturing consists largely of the production of specialist chemicals , health and pharmaceutical goods , scientific and precision measuring instruments and musical instruments . The largest exported goods are chemicals ( 34 % of exported goods ) , machines/electronics ( 20.9 % ) , and precision instruments/watches ( 16.9 % ) . Exported services amount to a third of exports . The service sector – especially banking and insurance , tourism , and international organisations – is another important industry for Switzerland .
After the American Revolutionary War , the number and proportion of free people of color increased markedly in the North and the South as slaves were freed . Most northern states abolished slavery , sometimes , like New York , in programs of gradual emancipation that took more than two decades to be completed . The last slaves in New York were not freed until 1827 . In connection with the Second Great Awakening , Quaker and Methodist preachers in the South urged slaveholders to free their slaves . Revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves , some by deed and others by will , so that from 1782 to 1810 , the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the South .
Northern leaders agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting . Secession and Confederate nationalism had to be totally repudiated and all forms of slavery or quasi-slavery had to be eliminated . Lincoln proved effective in mobilizing support for the war goals , raising large armies and supplying them , avoiding foreign interference , and making the end of slavery a war goal . The Confederacy had a larger area than it could defend , and it failed to keep its ports open and its rivers clear . The North kept up the pressure as the South could barely feed and clothe its soldiers . Its soldiers , especially those in the East under the command of General Robert E. Lee proved highly resourceful until they finally were overwhelmed by Generals Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman in 1864–65 , The Reconstruction Era ( 1863–77 ) began with the Emancipation proclamation in 1863 , and included freedom , full citizenship and the vote for the Southern blacks . It was followed by a reaction that left the blacks in a second class status legally , politically , socially and economically until the 1960s .
As of the first decade of the 21st century , contemporary neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of New Classical Architecture . Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism/Revivalism , Traditionalism or simply neoclassical architecture like the historical style . For sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture , materials and craftsmanship , the term Traditional Architecture ( or vernacular ) is mostly used . The Driehaus Architecture Prize is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture , and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist Pritzker Prize .
Greek culture has evolved over thousands of years , with its beginning in the Mycenaean civilization , continuing through the Classical period , the Roman and Eastern Roman periods and was profoundly affected by Christianity , which it in turn influenced and shaped . Ottoman Greeks had to endure through several centuries of adversity that culminated in genocide in the 20th century but nevertheless included cultural exchanges and enriched both cultures . The Diafotismos is credited with revitalizing Greek culture and giving birth to the synthesis of ancient and medieval elements that characterize it today .
The net quality of a ground reflection depends on the topography of the surface . When the irregularities of the surface are much smaller than the wavelength , we are in the regime of specular reflection , and the receiver sees both the real antenna and an image of the antenna under the ground due to reflection . But if the ground has irregularities not small compared to the wavelength , reflections will not be coherent but shifted by random phases . With shorter wavelengths ( higher frequencies ) , this is generally the case .
The most common source of new genes in eukaryotic lineages is gene duplication , which creates copy number variation of an existing gene in the genome . The resulting genes ( paralogs ) may then diverge in sequence and in function . Sets of genes formed in this way comprise a gene family . Gene duplications and losses within a family are common and represent a major source of evolutionary biodiversity . Sometimes , gene duplication may result in a nonfunctional copy of a gene , or a functional copy may be subject to mutations that result in loss of function ; such nonfunctional genes are called pseudogenes . :7.6
During this time , Atlantic City was under the mayoral reign of Edward L. Bader , known for his contributions to the construction , athletics and aviation of Atlantic City . Despite the opposition of many others , he purchased land that became the city 's municipal airport and high school football stadium , both of which were later named Bader Field in his honor . He led the initiative , in 1923 , to construct the Atlantic City High School at Albany and Atlantic Avenues . Bader , in November 1923 , initiated a public referendum , during the general election , at which time residents approved the construction of a Convention Center . The city passed an ordinance approving a bond issue for $ 1.5 million to be used for the purchase of land for Convention Hall , now known as the Boardwalk Hall , finalized September 30 , 1924 . Bader was also a driving force behind the creation of the Miss America competition .
In early 1962 Nasser again attempted to wrest control of the military command from Amer . Amer responded by directly confronting Nasser for the first time and secretly rallying his loyalist officers . Nasser ultimately backed down , wary of a possible violent confrontation between the military and his civilian government . According to Boghdadi , the stress caused by the UAR 's collapse and Amer 's increasing autonomy forced Nasser , who already had diabetes , to practically live on painkillers from then on .
In 2004 , worldwide sales of audio CDs , CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs . By 2007 , 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide . CDs are increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution , with the result that audio CD sales rates in the U.S. have dropped about 50 % from their peak ; however , they remain one of the primary distribution methods for the music industry . In 2014 , revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time .
In 2015 Beyoncé signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for ; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma , urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively , which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation .
The island experienced large-scale immigration over the 20th century , especially after the Second World War . Bermuda has a diverse population including both those with relatively deep roots in Bermuda extending back for centuries , and newer communities whose ancestry results from recent immigration , especially from Britain , North America , the West Indies , and the Portuguese Atlantic islands ( especially the Azores ) , although these groups are steadily merging . About 46 % of the population identified themselves with Bermudian ancestry in 2010 , which was a decrease from the 51 % who did so in the 2000 census . Those identifying with British ancestry dropped by 1 % to 11 % ( although those born in Britain remain the largest non-native group at 3,942 persons ) . The number of people born in Canada declined by 13 % . Those who reported West Indian ancestry were 13 % . The number of people born in the West Indies actually increased by 538 . A significant segment of the population is of Portuguese ancestry ( 10 % ) , the result of immigration over the past 160 years , of whom 79 % have residency status .

The downwards journey is completed at a reduced speed of 600 meters per minute , with the doors opening at the 52nd second .
The influence of Nasser 's Arab nationalism over the RCC was immediately apparent . The administration was instantly recognized by the neighbouring Arab nationalist regimes in Egypt , Syria , Iraq and Sudan , with Egypt sending experts to aid the inexperienced RCC . Gaddafi propounded Pan-Arab ideas , proclaiming the need for a single Arab state stretching across North Africa and the Middle East . In December 1969 , Libya founded the Arab Revolutionary Front with Egypt and Sudan as a step towards political unification , and in 1970 Syria stated its intention to join .
Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing , shortness of breath , chest tightness , and coughing . Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up . During recovery from an attack , it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils . Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air . Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms , usually in response to triggers , whereas others may have marked and persistent symptoms .
The San Diego Surf of the American Basketball Association is located in the city . The annual Farmers Insurance Open golf tournament ( formerly the Buick Invitational ) on the PGA Tour occurs at Torrey Pines Golf Course . This course was also the site of the 2008 U.S. Open Golf Championship . The San Diego Yacht Club hosted the America 's Cup yacht races three times during the period 1988 to 1995 . The amateur beach sport Over-the-line was invented in San Diego , and the annual world Over-the-line championships are held at Mission Bay every year .
The southern side of Miami includes Coral Way , The Roads and Coconut Grove . Coral Way is a historic residential neighborhood built in 1922 connecting Downtown with Coral Gables , and is home to many old homes and tree-lined streets . Coconut Grove was established in 1825 and is the location of Miami 's City Hall in Dinner Key , the Coconut Grove Playhouse , CocoWalk , many nightclubs , bars , restaurants and bohemian shops , and as such , is very popular with local college students . It is a historic neighborhood with narrow , winding roads , and a heavy tree canopy . Coconut Grove has many parks and gardens such as Villa Vizcaya , The Kampong , The Barnacle Historic State Park , and is the home of the Coconut Grove Convention Center and numerous historic homes and estates .
The first legal steps taken to end the occurrence of child labour was enacted more than fifty years ago . In 1966 , the nation adopted the UN General Assembly of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . This act legally limited the minimum age for when children could start work at the age of 14 . But 23 years later in 1989 the Convention on the Rights of Children was adopted and helped to reduce the exploitation of children and demanded safe working environments . They all worked towards the goal of ending the most problematic forms of child labour .
Von Neumann liked to eat and drink ; his wife , Klara , said that he could count everything except calories . He enjoyed Yiddish and " off-color " humor ( especially limericks ) . He was a non-smoker . At Princeton he received complaints for regularly playing extremely loud German march music on his gramophone , which distracted those in neighbouring offices , including Albert Einstein , from their work . Von Neumann did some of his best work blazingly fast in noisy , chaotic environments , and once admonished his wife for preparing a quiet study for him to work in . He never used it , preferring the couple 's living room with its television playing loudly .
Although testing can determine the correctness of software under the assumption of some specific hypotheses ( see hierarchy of testing difficulty below ) , testing can not identify all the defects within software . Instead , it furnishes a criticism or comparison that compares the state and behavior of the product against oracles—principles or mechanisms by which someone might recognize a problem . These oracles may include ( but are not limited to ) specifications , contracts , comparable products , past versions of the same product , inferences about intended or expected purpose , user or customer expectations , relevant standards , applicable laws , or other criteria .
According to John N. Gray , Popper held that " a theory is scientific only in so far as it is falsifiable , and should be given up as soon as it is falsified . " By applying Popper 's account of scientific method , Gray 's Straw Dogs states that this would have " killed the theories of Darwin and Einstein at birth . " When they were first advanced , Gray claims , each of them was " at odds with some available evidence ; only later did evidence become available that gave them crucial support . " Against this , Gray seeks to establish the irrationalist thesis that " the progress of science comes from acting against reason . "
There were four major HDTV systems tested by SMPTE in the late 1970s , and in 1979 an SMPTE study group released A Study of High Definition Television Systems :
Mexico’s capital is both the oldest capital city in the Americas and one of two founded by Amerindians ( Native Americans ) , the other being Quito . The city was originally built on an island of Lake Texcoco by the Aztecs in 1325 as Tenochtitlan , which was almost completely destroyed in the 1521 siege of Tenochtitlan , and subsequently redesigned and rebuilt in accordance with the Spanish urban standards . In 1524 , the municipality of Mexico City was established , known as México Tenochtitlán , and as of 1585 it was officially known as Ciudad de México ( Mexico City ) . Mexico City served as the political , administrative and financial center of a major part of the Spanish colonial empire . After independence from Spain was achieved , the Federal District was created in 1824 .
People of Ashkenazi descent constitute around 47.5 % of Israeli Jews ( and therefore 35–36 % of Israelis ) . They have played a prominent role in the economy , media , and politics of Israel since its founding . During the first decades of Israel as a state , strong cultural conflict occurred between Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews ( mainly east European Ashkenazim ) . The roots of this conflict , which still exists to a much smaller extent in present-day Israeli society , are chiefly attributed to the concept of the " melting pot " . That is to say , all Jewish immigrants who arrived in Israel were strongly encouraged to " melt down " their own particular exilic identities within the general social " pot " in order to become Israeli .
The Samoan word for dance is siva with unique gentle movements of the body in time to music and which tells a story , although the Samoan male dances can be more physical and snappy . The sasa is also a traditional dance where rows of dancers perform rapid synchronised movements in time to the rhythm of wooden drums ( pate ) or rolled mats . Another dance performed by males is called the fa'ataupati or the slap dance , creating rhythmic sounds by slapping different parts of the body . This is believed to have been derived from slapping insects on the body .
A number of sculptural ensembles of that era , erected at the tombs of royals and other dignitaries , have survived ( in various degrees of preservation ) in Nanjing 's northeastern and eastern suburbs , primarily in Qixia and Jiangning District . Possibly the best preserved of them is the ensemble of the Tomb of Xiao Xiu ( 475–518 ) , a brother of Emperor Wu of Liang . The period of division ended when the Sui Dynasty reunified China and almost destroyed the entire city , turning it into a small town .
Copper is synthesized in massive stars and is present in the Earth 's crust at a concentration of about 50 parts per million ( ppm ) , where it occurs as native copper or in minerals such as the copper sulfides chalcopyrite and chalcocite , the copper carbonates azurite and malachite , and the copper ( I ) oxide mineral cuprite . The largest mass of elemental copper discovered weighed 420 tonnes and was found in 1857 on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan , US . Native copper is a polycrystal , with the largest described single crystal measuring 4.4×3.2×3.2 cm .
The Heian period was preceded by the Nara period and began in 794 A.D after the movement of the capital of Japan to Heian-kyō ( present day Kyōto京都 ) , by the 50th emperor , Emperor Kanmu . Kanmu first tried to move the capital to Nagaoka-kyō , but a series of disasters befell the city , prompting the emperor to relocate the capital a second time , to Heian . The Heian Period is considered a high point in Japanese culture that later generations have always admired . The period is also noted for the rise of the samurai class , which would eventually take power and start the feudal period of Japan .
The Premier League is broadcast in the United States through NBC Sports . Premier League viewership has increased rapidly , with NBC and NBCSN averaging a record 479,000 viewers in the 2014–15 season , up 118 % from 2012–13 when coverage still aired on Fox Soccer and ESPN/ESPN2 ( 220,000 viewers ) , and NBC Sports has been widely praised for its coverage . NBC Sports reached a six-year extension with the Premier League in 2015 to broadcast the league through the 2021–22 season in a deal valued at $ 1 billion ( £640 million ) .
The Greeks of the Classical era made several notable contributions to science and helped lay the foundations of several western scientific traditions , like philosophy , historiography and mathematics . The scholarly tradition of the Greek academies was maintained during Roman times with several academic institutions in Constantinople , Antioch , Alexandria and other centres of Greek learning while Eastern Roman science was essentially a continuation of classical science . Greeks have a long tradition of valuing and investing in paideia ( education ) . Paideia was one of the highest societal values in the Greek and Hellenistic world while the first European institution described as a university was founded in 5th century Constantinople and operated in various incarnations until the city 's fall to the Ottomans in 1453 . The University of Constantinople was Christian Europe 's first secular institution of higher learning since no theological subjects were taught , and considering the original meaning of the world university as a corporation of students , the world’s first university as well .
During the Cold War , a principal focus of Canadian defence policy was contributing to the security of Europe in the face of the Soviet military threat . Toward that end , Canadian ground and air forces were based in Europe from the early 1950s until the early 1990s .
Stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley , and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast . There are a number of variations including Baltic porter , dry stout , and Imperial stout . The name Porter was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of London . This same beer later also became known as stout , though the word stout had been used as early as 1677 . The history and development of stout and porter are intertwined .
After World War II , eastern European countries such as the Soviet Union , Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Romania and Yugoslavia expelled the Germans from their territories . Many of those had inhabited these lands for centuries , developing a unique culture . Germans were also forced to leave the former eastern territories of Germany , which were annexed by Poland ( Silesia , Pomerania , parts of Brandenburg and southern part of East Prussia ) and the Soviet Union ( northern part of East Prussia ) . Between 12 and 16,5 million ethnic Germans and German citizens were expelled westwards to allied-occupied Germany .
About 69 % of the population is of Dutch ancestry . Approximately 10 % of the population consists of immigrants from Western countries , while 21 % of the population is of non-Western origin ( 9 % Moroccan , 5 % Turkish , 3 % Surinamese and Dutch Caribbean and 5 % of other countries ) . Some of the city 's boroughs have a relatively high percentage of originally non-Dutch inhabitants – i.e . Kanaleneiland 83 % and Overvecht 57 % . Like Rotterdam , Amsterdam , The Hague and other large Dutch cities , Utrecht faces some socio-economic problems . About 38 % percent of its population either earns a minimum income or is dependent on social welfare ( 17 % of all households ) . Boroughs such as Kanaleneiland , Overvecht and Hoograven consist primarily of high-rise housing developments , and are known for relatively high poverty and crime rate .
On August 24 , 2006 , Apple and Creative announced a broad settlement to end their legal disputes . Apple will pay Creative US $ 100 million for a paid-up license , to use Creative 's awarded patent in all Apple products . As part of the agreement , Apple will recoup part of its payment , if Creative is successful in licensing the patent . Creative then announced its intention to produce iPod accessories by joining the Made for iPod program .
The English sailor and adventurer William Adams ( 1564–1620 ) was the first Westerner to receive the dignity of samurai . The Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu presented him with two swords representing the authority of a samurai , and decreed that William Adams the sailor was dead and that Anjin Miura ( 三浦按針 ) , a samurai , was born . Adams also received the title of hatamoto ( bannerman ) , a high-prestige position as a direct retainer in the Shogun 's court . He was provided with generous revenues : " For the services that I have done and do daily , being employed in the Emperor 's service , the Emperor has given me a living " ( Letters ) . He was granted a fief in Hemi ( 逸見 ) within the boundaries of present-day Yokosuka City , " with eighty or ninety husbandmen , that be my slaves or servants " ( Letters ) . His estate was valued at 250 koku . He finally wrote " God hath provided for me after my great misery " , ( Letters ) by which he meant the disaster-ridden voyage that initially brought him to Japan .
In May 2014 , the Government of China banned the internal purchase of Windows 8-based products under government contracts requiring " energy-efficient " devices . The Xinhua News Agency claimed that Windows 8 was being banned in protest of Microsoft 's support lifecycle policy and the end of support for Windows XP ( which , as of January 2014 , had a market share of 49 % in China ) , as the government " obviously can not ignore the risks of running OS [ sic ] without guaranteed technical support . " However , Ni Guangnan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences had also previously warned that Windows 8 could allegedly expose users to surveillance by the United States government due to its heavy use of internet-based services .

Most Israelis are drafted into the military at the age of 18 . Men serve two years and eight months and women two years . Following mandatory service , Israeli men join the reserve forces and usually do up to several weeks of reserve duty every year until their forties . Most women are exempt from reserve duty . Arab citizens of Israel ( except the Druze ) and those engaged in full-time religious studies are exempt from military service , although the exemption of yeshiva students has been a source of contention in Israeli society for many years . An alternative for those who receive exemptions on various grounds is Sherut Leumi , or national service , which involves a program of service in hospitals , schools and other social welfare frameworks . As a result of its conscription program , the IDF maintains approximately 176,500 active troops and an additional 445,000 reservists .
Berlin starts National Cyber Defense Initiative : On June 16 , 2011 , the German Minister for Home Affairs , officially opened the new German NCAZ ( National Center for Cyber Defense ) Nationales Cyber-Abwehrzentrum located in Bonn . The NCAZ closely cooperates with BSI ( Federal Office for Information Security ) Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik , BKA ( Federal Police Organisation ) Bundeskriminalamt ( Deutschland ) , BND ( Federal Intelligence Service ) Bundesnachrichtendienst , MAD ( Military Intelligence Service ) Amt für den Militärischen Abschirmdienst and other national organisations in Germany taking care of national security aspects . According to the Minister the primary task of the new organisation founded on February 23 , 2011 , is to detect and prevent attacks against the national infrastructure and mentioned incidents like Stuxnet .
The Japanese enlarged administration and appointed local leaders , which weakened the authority of local traditional leaders . Japan also tried to change the social organization in the islands from Matrilineality to the Japanese Patriarchal system , but with no success . Moreover , during the 1930s , one third of all land up to the high water level was declared the property of the Japanese government . On the archipelago , before it banned foreign traders , the activities of Catholic and Protestant missionaries were allowed . Indigenous people were educated in Japanese schools , and studied Japanese language and Japanese culture . This policy was the government strategy not only in the Marshall Islands , but on all the other mandated territories in Micronesia . On March 27 , 1933 , Japan handed in its notice at the League of Nations , but continued to manage the islands , and in the late 1930s began building air bases on several atolls . The Marshall Islands were in an important geographical position , being the easternmost point in Japan 's defensive ring at the beginning of World War II .
In January 1989 , Madonna signed an endorsement deal with soft-drink manufacturer , Pepsi . In one of her Pepsi commercials , she debuted her song " Like a Prayer " . The corresponding music video featured many Catholic symbols such as stigmata and cross burning , and a dream of making love to a saint , leading the Vatican to condemn the video . Religious groups sought to ban the commercial and boycott Pepsi products . Pepsi revoked the commercial and canceled her sponsorship contract . The song was included on Madonna 's fourth studio album , Like a Prayer , which was co-written and co-produced by Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray . Madonna received positive feedback for the album , with Rolling Stone writing that it was " as close to art as pop music gets " . Like a Prayer peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 15 million copies worldwide , with 4 million copies sold in the U.S. alone . Six singles were released from the album , including " Like a Prayer " , which reached number one , and " Express Yourself " and " Cherish " , both peaking at number two . By the end of the 1980s , Madonna was named as the " Artist of the Decade " by MTV , Billboard and Musician magazine .
In 1956 , the British and French prime ministers , Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet , discussed the possibility of France joining the Commonwealth . The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the Treaty of Rome , which established the European Economic Community , the precursor to the European Union . In November 1956 , Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal . Lord Mountbatten claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion , though Eden denied it . Eden resigned two months later .
From April 20–23 , 1989 , pre-election meetings were held in Lviv for four consecutive days , drawing crowds of up to 25,000 . The action included an one-hour warning strike at eight local factories and institutions . It was the first labor strike in Lviv since 1944 . On May 3 , a pre-election rally attracted 30,000 in Lviv . On May 7 , The Memorial Society organized a mass meeting at Bykivnia , site of a mass grave of Ukrainian and Polish victims of Stalinist terror . After a march from Kiev to the site , a memorial service was staged .
Treaties can be loosely compared to contracts : both are means of willing parties assuming obligations among themselves , and a party to either that fails to live up to their obligations can be held liable under international law .
Modern Egypt is considered to be a regional and middle power , with significant cultural , political , and military influence in North Africa , the Middle East and the Muslim world . Its economy is one of the largest and most diversified in the Middle East , with sectors such as tourism , agriculture , industry and services at almost equal production levels . In 2011 , longtime President Hosni Mubarak stepped down amid mass protests . Later elections saw the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood , which was ousted by the army a year later amid mass protests .
Historians see the growing Roman influence over the east , as with the west , as not a matter of intentional empire-building , but constant crisis management narrowly focused on short-term goals within a highly unstable , unpredictable , and inter-dependent network of alliances and dependencies . With some major exceptions of outright military rule , the Roman Republic remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms ( with varying degrees of independence , both de jure and de facto ) until it transitioned into the Roman Empire . It was not until the time of the Roman Empire that the entire Roman world was organized into provinces under explicit Roman control .
Biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli described her ballad " I 'll Remember " ( 1994 ) as an attempt to tone down her provocative image . The song was recorded for Alek Keshishian 's film With Honors . She made a subdued appearance with Letterman at an awards show and appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno after realizing that she needed to change her musical direction in order to sustain her popularity . With her sixth studio album , Bedtime Stories ( 1994 ) , Madonna employed a softer image to try to improve the public perception . The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and produced four singles , including " Secret " and " Take a Bow " , the latter topping the Hot 100 for seven weeks , the longest period of any Madonna single . At the same time , she became romantically involved with fitness trainer Carlos Leon . Something to Remember , a collection of ballads , was released in November 1995 . The album featured three new songs : " You 'll See " , " One More Chance " , and a cover of Marvin Gaye 's " I Want You " .
In ancient Greece , the epics of Homer , who wrote the Iliad and the Odyssey , and Hesiod , who wrote Works and Days and Theogony , are some of the earliest , and most influential , of Ancient Greek literature . Classical Greek genres included philosophy , poetry , historiography , comedies and dramas . Plato and Aristotle authored philosophical texts that are the foundation of Western philosophy , Sappho and Pindar were influential lyric poets , and Herodotus and Thucydides were early Greek historians . Although drama was popular in Ancient Greece , of the hundreds of tragedies written and performed during the classical age , only a limited number of plays by three authors still exist : Aeschylus , Sophocles , and Euripides . The plays of Aristophanes provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy , the earliest form of Greek Comedy , and are in fact used to define the genre .
In an attempt to gain increased support from Polish nationalists and patriots , Napoleon termed the war the Second Polish War—the First Polish War had been the Bar Confederation uprising by Polish nobles against Russia in 1768 . Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland to be joined with the Duchy of Warsaw and an independent Poland created . This was rejected by Napoleon , who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen . Napoleon refused to manumit the Russian serfs because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army 's rear . The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France 's retreat .
Opinions differ whether the transition to liberal democracy is underway . According to some reports , the military 's presence continues as the label 'disciplined democracy ' suggests . This label asserts that the Burmese military is allowing certain civil liberties while clandestinely institutionalising itself further into Burmese politics . Such an assertion assumes that reforms only occurred when the military was able to safeguard its own interests through the transition—here , " transition " does not refer to a transition to a liberal democracy , but transition to a quasi-military rule .
Mali underwent economic reform , beginning in 1988 by signing agreements with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . During 1988 to 1996 , Mali 's government largely reformed public enterprises . Since the agreement , sixteen enterprises were privatized , 12 partially privatized , and 20 liquidated . In 2005 , the Malian government conceded a railroad company to the Savage Corporation . Two major companies , Societé de Telecommunications du Mali ( SOTELMA ) and the Cotton Ginning Company ( CMDT ) , were expected to be privatized in 2008 .
Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture , convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world , mostly depending on distance from the equator . Although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends , all renewable energies , other than geothermal and tidal , derive their energy from the Sun in a direct or indirect way .
British colonial rule introduced Western elements of culture to Burma . Burma 's education system is modelled after that of the United Kingdom . Colonial architectural influences are most evident in major cities such as Yangon . Many ethnic minorities , particularly the Karen in the southeast and the Kachin and Chin who populate the north and northeast , practice Christianity . According to the The World Factbook , the Burman population is 68 % and the ethnic groups constitute 32 % . However , the exiled leaders and organisations claims that ethnic population is 40 % , which is implicitly contrasted with CIA report ( official US report ) .
In intelligent mammals , such as primates , the cerebrum is larger relative to the rest of the brain . Intelligence itself is not easy to define , but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn , matched with behavioral flexibility . Rats , for example , are considered to be highly intelligent , as they can learn and perform new tasks , an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat . In some mammals , food gathering appears to be related to intelligence : a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat , which must think to outwit its prey .
During a 10-day run in Oklahoma City , the State Fair of Oklahoma attracts roughly one million people along with the annual Festival of the Arts . Large national pow-wows , various Latin and Asian heritage festivals , and cultural festivals such as the Juneteenth celebrations are held in Oklahoma City each year . The Tulsa State Fair attracts over one million people during its 10-day run , and the city 's Mayfest festival entertained more than 375,000 people in four days during 2007 . In 2006 , Tulsa 's Oktoberfest was named one of the top 10 in the world by USA Today and one of the top German food festivals in the nation by Bon Appetit magazine .
Major projects include the current construction of a new campus for Gateway Community College downtown , and also a 32-story , 500-unit apartment/retail building called 360 State Street . The 360 State Street project is now occupied and is the largest residential building in Connecticut . A new boathouse and dock is planned for New Haven Harbor , and the linear park Farmington Canal Trail is set to extend into downtown New Haven within the coming year . Additionally , foundation and ramp work to widen I-95 to create a new harbor crossing for New Haven , with an extradosed bridge to replace the 1950s-era Q Bridge , has begun . The city still hopes to redevelop the site of the New Haven Coliseum , which was demolished in 2007 .
The most commonly used forms of medium distance transport in Hyderabad include government owned services such as light railways and buses , as well as privately operated taxis and auto rickshaws . Bus services operate from the Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station in the city centre and carry over 130 million passengers daily across the entire network . :76 Hyderabad 's light rail transportation system , the Multi-Modal Transport System ( MMTS ) , is a three line suburban rail service used by over 160,000 passengers daily . Complementing these government services are minibus routes operated by Setwin ( Society for Employment Promotion & Training in Twin Cities ) . Intercity rail services also operate from Hyderabad ; the main , and largest , station is Secunderabad Railway Station , which serves as Indian Railways ' South Central Railway zone headquarters and a hub for both buses and MMTS light rail services connecting Secunderabad and Hyderabad . Other major railway stations in Hyderabad are Hyderabad Deccan Station , Kachiguda Railway Station , Begumpet Railway Station , Malkajgiri Railway Station and Lingampally Railway Station . The Hyderabad Metro , a new rapid transit system , is to be added to the existing public transport infrastructure and is scheduled to operate three lines by 2015 .
Some researchers believe that the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the 17th century . According to this hypothesis , in 1648 several koches of Semyon Dezhnyov 's expedition came ashore in Alaska by storm and founded this settlement . This hypothesis is based on the testimony of Chukchi geographer Nikolai Daurkin , who had visited Alaska in 1764–1765 and who had reported on a village on the Kheuveren River , populated by " bearded men " who " pray to the icons " . Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with Koyuk River .
Voting results have been a consistent source of controversy . The mechanism of voting had also aroused considerable criticisms , most notably in season two when Ruben Studdard beat Clay Aiken in a close vote , and in season eight , when the massive increase in text votes ( 100 million more text votes than season 7 ) fueled the texting controversy . Concerns about power voting have been expressed from the very first season . Since 2004 , votes also have been affected to a limited degree by online communities such as DialIdol , Vote for the Worst ( closed in 2013 ) , and Vote for the Girls ( started 2010 ) .
The earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo , may be two figures from the Ionic sanctuary on the island of Delos . Such statues were found across the Greek speaking world , the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoios , Boeotia alone . The last stage in the development of the Kouros type is the late archaic period ( 520–485 BC ) , in which the Greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole . Ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze Piraeus Apollo . It was found in Piraeus , the harbour of Athens . The statue originally held the bow in its left hand , and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand . It probably comes from north-eastern Peloponnesus . The emphasis is given in anatomy , and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion , and beauty relative to proportions , which appear mostly in post-Archaic art . The statue throws some light on an artistic centre which , with an independently developed harder , simpler , and heavier style , restricts Ionian influence in Athens . Finally , this is the germ from which the art of Polykleitos was to grow two or three generations later .
Albert the Great wrote that wisdom and understanding enhance one 's faith in God . According to him , these are the tools that God uses to commune with a contemplative . Love in the soul is both the cause and result of true understanding and judgement . It causes not only an intellectual knowledge of God , but a spiritual and emotional knowledge as well . Contemplation is the means whereby one can obtain this goal of understanding . Things that once seemed static and unchanging become full of possibility and perfection . The contemplative then knows that God is , but she does not know what God is . Thus , contemplation forever produces a mystified , imperfect knowledge of God . The soul is exalted beyond the rest of God 's creation but it can not see God Himself .
The Great Depression ended at different times in different countries with the effect lasting into the next era . America 's Great Depression ended in 1941 with America 's entry into World War II . The majority of countries set up relief programs , and most underwent some sort of political upheaval , pushing them to the left or right . In some world states , the desperate citizens turned toward nationalist demagogues—the most infamous being Adolf Hitler—setting the stage for the next era of war . The convulsion brought on by the worldwide depression resulted in the rise of Nazism . In Asia , Japan became an ever more assertive power , especially with regards to China .
Insects were among the earliest terrestrial herbivores and acted as major selection agents on plants . Plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects , in turn , evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins . Many insects make use of these toxins to protect themselves from their predators . Such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors . This successful evolutionary pattern has also been used by mimics . Over time , this has led to complex groups of coevolved species . Conversely , some interactions between plants and insects , like pollination , are beneficial to both organisms . Coevolution has led to the development of very specific mutualisms in such systems .
Clay models of ducks found in China dating back to 4000 BC may indicate the domestication of ducks took place there during the Yangshao culture . Even if this is not the case , domestication of the duck took place in the Far East at least 1500 years earlier than in the West . Lucius Columella , writing in the first century BC , advised those who sought to rear ducks to collect wildfowl eggs and put them under a broody hen , because when raised in this way , the ducks " lay aside their wild nature and without hesitation breed when shut up in the bird pen " . Despite this , ducks did not appear in agricultural texts in Western Europe until about 810 AD , when they began to be mentioned alongside geese , chickens , and peafowl as being used for rental payments made by tenants to landowners .
Though almost any variety of acoustic mandolin might be adequate for Irish traditional music , virtually all Irish players prefer flat-backed instruments with oval sound holes to the Italian-style bowl-back mandolins or the carved-top mandolins with f-holes favoured by bluegrass mandolinists . The former are often too soft-toned to hold their own in a session ( as well as having a tendency to not stay in place on the player 's lap ) , whilst the latter tend to sound harsh and overbearing to the traditional ear . The f-hole mandolin , however , does come into its own in a traditional session , where its brighter tone cuts through the sonic clutter of a pub . Greatly preferred for formal performance and recording are flat-topped " Irish-style " mandolins ( reminiscent of the WWI-era Martin Army-Navy mandolin ) and carved ( arch ) top mandolins with oval soundholes , such as the Gibson A-style of the 1920s .
About 150,000 East African and black people live in Israel , amounting to just over 2 % of the nation 's population . The vast majority of these , some 120,000 , are Beta Israel , most of whom are recent immigrants who came during the 1980s and 1990s from Ethiopia . In addition , Israel is home to over 5,000 members of the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem movement that are descendants of African Americans who emigrated to Israel in the 20th century , and who reside mainly in a distinct neighborhood in the Negev town of Dimona . Unknown numbers of black converts to Judaism reside in Israel , most of them converts from the United Kingdom , Canada , and the United States .
After his arrival in 1674 , Captain Damian de Esplana ordered the arrest of rebels who attacked the population of certain towns . Hostilities eventually led to the destruction of villages such as Chochogo , Pepura , Tumon , Sidia-Aty , Sagua , Nagan and Ninca . :74–75 Starting in June 1676 , the first Spanish Governor of Guam , Capt . Francisco de Irrisarri y Vinar controlled internal affairs more strictly than his predecessors in order to curb tensions . He also ordered the construction of schools , roads and other infrastructure . :75–76 Later , Capt . Jose de Quiroga arrived in 1680 and continued some of the development projects started by his predecessors . He also continued the search for the rebels who had assassinated Father San Vitores , resulting in campaigns against the rebels which were hiding out in some islands , eventually leading to the death of Matapang , Hurao and Aguarin . :77–78 Quiroga brought some natives from the northern islands to Guam , ordering the population to live in a few large villages . :78–79 These included Jinapsan , Umatac , Pago , Agat and Inarajan , where he built a number of churches . :79 By July 1695 , Quiroga had completed the pacification process in Guam , Rota , Tinian and Aguigan . :85
Currently printed denominations are $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 50 , and $ 100 . Notes above the $ 100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969 . These notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by organized crime ; it was the latter usage that prompted President Richard Nixon to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use . With the advent of electronic banking , they became less necessary . Notes in denominations of $ 500 , $ 1,000 , $ 5,000 , $ 10,000 and $ 100,000 were all produced at one time ; see large denomination bills in U.S. currency for details . These notes are now collectors ' items and are worth more than their face value to collectors .
The constraints of constructing a flight deck affect the role of a given carrier strongly , as they influence the weight , type , and configuration of the aircraft that may be launched . For example , assisted launch mechanisms are used primarily for heavy aircraft , especially those loaded with air-to-ground weapons . CATOBAR is most commonly used on USN supercarriers as it allows the deployment of heavy jets with full loadouts , especially on ground-attack missions . STOVL is used by other navies because it is cheaper to operate and still provides good deployment capability for fighter aircraft .
In military affairs , the use of infantry with specialised roles increased . Along with the still-dominant heavy cavalry , armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen , as well as sappers and engineers . Crossbows , which had been known in Late Antiquity , increased in use partly because of the increase in siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries . [ AB ] The increasing use of crossbows during the 12th and 13th centuries led to the use of closed-face helmets , heavy body armour , as well as horse armour . Gunpowder was known in Europe by the mid-13th century with a recorded use in European warfare by the English against the Scots in 1304 , although it was merely used as an explosive and not as a weapon . Cannon were being used for sieges in the 1320s , and hand-held guns were in use by the 1360s .
A very high resolution source may require more bandwidth than available in order to be transmitted without loss of fidelity . The lossy compression that is used in all digital HDTV storage and transmission systems will distort the received picture , when compared to the uncompressed source .
In 1971 , the United States Department of Health , Education , and Welfare approached Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Stan Lee to do a comic book story about drug abuse . Lee agreed and wrote a three-part Spider-Man story portraying drug use as dangerous and unglamorous . However , the industry 's self-censorship board , the Comics Code Authority , refused to approve the story because of the presence of narcotics , deeming the context of the story irrelevant . Lee , with Goodman 's approval , published the story regardless in The Amazing Spider-Man # 96–98 ( May–July 1971 ) , without the Comics Code seal . The market reacted well to the storyline , and the CCA subsequently revised the Code the same year .
The SASO consists of 12 questions . Six of these questions assess sexual attraction , four assess sexual behavior , and two assess sexual orientation identity . For each question on the scale that measures homosexuality there is a corresponding question that measures heterosexuality giving six matching pairs of questions . Taken all together , the six pairs of questions and responses provide a profile of an individual 's sexual orientation . However , results can be further simplified into four summaries that look specifically at responses that correspond to either homosexuality , heterosexuality , bisexuality or asexuality .
Under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin , the Bolsheviks established the Soviet state on 7 November [ O.S . 25 October ] 1917 , immediately after the Russian Provisional Government , which governed the Russian Republic , was overthrown during the October Revolution . Initially , the state did not have an official name and was n't recognized by neighboring countries for five months . Meanwhile , anti-Bolsheviks coined the mocking label " Sovdepia " for the nascent state of the " Soviets of Workers ' and Peasants ' Deputies " .
Frederick II of Prussia had received reports of the clashes in North America and had formed an alliance with Great Britain . On 29 August 1756 , he led Prussian troops across the border of Saxony , one of the small German states in league with Austria . He intended this as a bold pre-emption of an anticipated Austro-French invasion of Silesia . He had three goals in his new war on Austria . First , he would seize Saxony and eliminate it as a threat to Prussia , then using the Saxon army and treasury to aid the Prussian war effort . His second goal was to advance into Bohemia where he might set up winter quarters at Austria 's expense . Thirdly , he wanted to invade Moravia from Silesia , seize the fortress at Olmütz , and advance on Vienna to force an end to the war .
Dogs have lived and worked with humans in so many roles that they have earned the unique nickname , " man 's best friend " , a phrase used in other languages as well . They have been bred for herding livestock , hunting ( e.g . pointers and hounds ) , rodent control , guarding , helping fishermen with nets , detection dogs , and pulling loads , in addition to their roles as companions . In 1957 , a husky-terrier mix named Laika became the first animal to orbit the Earth .
London is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world and in 2015 was ranked as the most visited city in the world with over 65 million visits . It is also the top city in the world by visitor cross-border spending , estimated at US $ 20.23 billion in 2015 Tourism is one of London 's prime industries , employing the equivalent of 350,000 full-time workers in 2003 , and the city accounts for 54 % of all inbound visitor spend in UK . As of 2016 London is rated as the world top ranked city destination by TripAdvisor users .
Children working at a young age has been a consistent theme throughout Africa . Many children began first working in the home to help their parents run the family farm . Children in Africa today are often forced into exploitative labour due to family debt and other financial factors , leading to ongoing poverty . Other types of domestic child labour include working in commercial plantations , begging , and other sales such as boot shining . In total , there is an estimated five million children who are currently working in the field of agriculture which steadily increases during the time of harvest . Along with 30 percent of children who are picking coffee , there are an estimated 25,000 school age children who work year round .
Filming started in Austria in December 2014 , with production taking in the area around Sölden—including the Ötztal Glacier Road , Rettenbach glacier and the adjacent ski resort and cable car station—and Obertilliach and Lake Altaussee , before concluding in February 2015 . Scenes filmed in Austria centred on the Ice Q Restaurant , standing in for the fictional Hoffler Klinik , a private medical clinic in the Austrian Alps . Filming included an action scene featuring a Land Rover Defender Bigfoot and a Range Rover Sport . Production was temporarily halted first by an injury to Craig , who sprained his knee whilst shooting a fight scene , and later by an accident involving a filming vehicle that saw three crew members injured , at least one of them seriously .
From 2000 to 2010 , the average cost per asthma-related hospital stay in the United States for children remained relatively stable at about $ 3,600 , whereas the average cost per asthma-related hospital stay for adults increased from $ 5,200 to $ 6,600 . In 2010 , Medicaid was the most frequent primary payer among children and adults aged 18–44 years in the United States ; private insurance was the second most frequent payer . Among both children and adults in the lowest income communities in the United States there is a higher rates of hospital stays for asthma in 2010 than those in the highest income communities .
Since the late 18th century , Paris has been famous for its restaurants and haute cuisine , food meticulously prepared and artfully presented . A luxury restaurant , La Taverne Anglaise , opened in 1786 in the arcades of the Palais-Royal by Antoine Beauvilliers ; it featured an elegant dining room , an extensive menu , linen tablecloths , a large wine list and well-trained waiters ; it became a model for future Paris restaurants . The restaurant Le Grand Véfour in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period . The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century , including the Café de Paris , the Rocher de Cancale , the Café Anglais , Maison Dorée and the Café Riche , were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens ; they were immortalised in the novels of Balzac and Émile Zola . Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the Belle Epoque , including Maxim 's on Rue Royale , Ledoyen in the gardens of the Champs-Élysées , and the Tour d'Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle .
The small landowner-cultivators formed the majority of the Han tax base ; this revenue was threatened during the latter half of Eastern Han when many peasants fell into debt and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy landlords . The Han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner-cultivators out of debt and on their own farms . These reforms included reducing taxes , temporary remissions of taxes , granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary lodging and work in agricultural colonies until they could recover from their debts .
Also in Carrasco is The British Schools of Montevideo , one of the oldest educational institutions in the country , established in 1908 . [ citation needed ] Its original purpose was to give Uruguayan children a complete education , on par with the best schools of the United Kingdom and to establish strong bonds between the British and Uruguayan children living in the country . The School is governed by the Board of Governors , elected by the British Schools Society in Uruguay , whose honorary president is the British Ambassador to Uruguay . Prominent alumni include former government ministers Pedro Bordaberry Herrán and Gabriel Gurméndez Armand-Ugon .
Yale 's museum collections are also of international stature . The Yale University Art Gallery , the country 's first university-affiliated art museum , contains more than 180,000 works , including Old Masters and important collections of modern art , in the Swartout and Kahn buildings . The latter , Louis Kahn 's first large-scale American work ( 1953 ) , was renovated and reopened in December 2006 . The Yale Center for British Art , the largest collection of British art outside of the UK , grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building .
Even though the book had barely hinted at human evolution , it quickly became central to the debate as mental and moral qualities were seen as spiritual aspects of the immaterial soul , and it was believed that animals did not have spiritual qualities . This conflict could be reconciled by supposing there was some supernatural intervention on the path leading to humans , or viewing evolution as a purposeful and progressive ascent to mankind 's position at the head of nature . While many conservative theologians accepted evolution , Charles Hodge argued in his 1874 critique " What is Darwinism ? " that " Darwinism " , defined narrowly as including rejection of design , was atheism though he accepted that Asa Gray did not reject design . Asa Gray responded that this charge misrepresented Darwin 's text . By the early 20th century , four noted authors of The Fundamentals were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through evolution , but fundamentalism inspired the American creation–evolution controversy that began in the 1920s . Some conservative Roman Catholic writers and influential Jesuits opposed evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century , but other Catholic writers , starting with Mivart , pointed out that early Church Fathers had not interpreted Genesis literally in this area . The Vatican stated its official position in a 1950 papal encyclical , which held that evolution was not inconsistent with Catholic teaching .
Development Testing is a software development process that involves synchronized application of a broad spectrum of defect prevention and detection strategies in order to reduce software development risks , time , and costs . It is performed by the software developer or engineer during the construction phase of the software development lifecycle . Rather than replace traditional QA focuses , it augments it . Development Testing aims to eliminate construction errors before code is promoted to QA ; this strategy is intended to increase the quality of the resulting software as well as the efficiency of the overall development and QA process .
In 1903 , Brigham Young Academy was dissolved , and was replaced by two institutions : Brigham Young High School , and Brigham Young University . ( The BY High School class of 1907 was ultimately responsible for the famous giant " Y " that is to this day embedded on a mountain near campus . ) The Board elected George H. Brimhall as the new President of BYU . He had not received a high school education until he was forty . Nevertheless , he was an excellent orator and organizer . Under his tenure in 1904 the new Brigham Young University bought 17 acres ( 69,000 m2 ) of land from Provo called " Temple Hill " . After some controversy among locals over BYU 's purchase of this property , construction began in 1909 on the first building on the current campus , the Karl G. Maeser Memorial . Brimhall also presided over the University during a brief crisis involving the theory of evolution . The religious nature of the school seemed at the time to collide with this scientific theory . Joseph F. Smith , LDS Church president , settled the question for a time by asking that evolution not be taught at the school . A few have described the school at this time as nothing more than a " religious seminary " . However , many of its graduates at this time would go on to great success and become well renowned in their fields .
John , the youngest of five sons of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine , was at first not expected to inherit significant lands . Following the failed rebellion of his elder brothers between 1173 and 1174 , however , John became Henry 's favourite child . He was appointed the Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent . John 's elder brothers William , Henry and Geoffrey died young ; by the time Richard I became king in 1189 , John was a potential heir to the throne . John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against Richard 's royal administrators whilst his brother was participating in the Third Crusade . Despite this , after Richard died in 1199 , John was proclaimed King of England , and came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise John 's possession of the continental Angevin lands at the peace treaty of Le Goulet in 1200 .
Islam is the most widely practised religion in Southeast Asia , numbering approximately 240 million adherents which translate to about 40 % of the entire population , with majorities in Indonesia , Brunei , Malaysia and in Southern Philippines with Indonesia as the largest and most populated Muslim country around the world . Countries in Southeast Asia practice many different religions . Buddhism is predominant in Thailand , Cambodia , Laos , Burma , Vietnam and Singapore . Ancestor worship and Confucianism are also widely practised in Vietnam and Singapore . Christianity is predominant in the Philippines , eastern Indonesia , East Malaysia and East Timor . The Philippines has the largest Roman Catholic population in Asia . East Timor is also predominantly Roman Catholic due to a history of Portuguese rule .
Some other cultures do not recognize a homosexual/heterosexual/bisexual distinction . It is common to distinguish a person 's sexuality according to their sexual role ( active/passive ; insertive/penetrated ) . In this distinction , the passive role is typically associated with femininity and/or inferiority , while the active role is typically associated with masculinity and/or superiority . For example , an investigation of a small Brazilian fishing village revealed three sexual categories for men : men who have sex only with men ( consistently in a passive role ) , men who have sex only with women , and men who have sex with women and men ( consistently in an active role ) . While men who consistently occupied the passive role were recognized as a distinct group by locals , men who have sex with only women , and men who have sex with women and men , were not differentiated . Little is known about same-sex attracted females , or sexual behavior between females in these cultures .
This growing coalition expanded the potential enemies that Rome might face , and moved Rome closer to confrontation with major powers . The result was more alliance-seeking , on the part of both the Roman confederacy and city-states seeking membership ( and protection ) within that confederacy . While there were exceptions to this ( such as military rule of Sicily after the First Punic War ) , it was not until after the Second Punic War that these alliances started to harden into something more like an empire , at least in certain locations . This shift mainly took place in parts of the west , such as the southern Italian towns that sided with Hannibal .
It is easy for Western-educated scholars to fall into the trap of viewing hunter-gatherer social and sexual arrangements in the light of Western values . [ editorializing ] One common arrangement is the sexual division of labour , with women doing most of the gathering , while men concentrate on big game hunting . It might be imagined that this arrangement oppresses women , keeping them in the domestic sphere . However , according to some observers , hunter-gatherer women would not understand this interpretation . Since childcare is collective , with every baby having multiple mothers and male carers , the domestic sphere is not atomised or privatised but an empowering place to be . [ citation needed ] In all hunter-gatherer societies , women appreciate the meat brought back to camp by men . An illustrative account is Megan Biesele 's study of the southern African Ju/'hoan , 'Women Like Meat ' . Recent archaeological research suggests that the sexual division of labor was the fundamental organisational innovation that gave Homo sapiens the edge over the Neanderthals , allowing our ancestors to migrate from Africa and spread across the globe .
The largest single execution in United States history was the hanging of 38 American Indians convicted of murder and rape during the Dakota War of 1862 . They were executed simultaneously on December 26 , 1862 , in Mankato , Minnesota . A single blow from an axe cut the rope that held the large four-sided platform , and the prisoners ( except for one whose rope had broken and who had to be re-hanged ) fell to their deaths . The second-largest mass execution was also a hanging : the execution of 13 African-American soldiers for taking part in the Houston Riot of 1917 . The largest non-military mass execution occurred in one of the original thirteen colonies in 1723 , when 26 convicted pirates were hanged in Newport , Rhode Island by order of the Admiralty Court .
In December 1831 , he joined the Beagle expedition as a gentleman naturalist and geologist . He read Charles Lyell 's Principles of Geology and from the first stop ashore , at St. Jago , found Lyell 's uniformitarianism a key to the geological history of landscapes . Darwin discovered fossils resembling huge armadillos , and noted the geographical distribution of modern species in hope of finding their " centre of creation " . The three Fuegian missionaries the expedition returned to Tierra del Fuego were friendly and civilised , yet to Darwin their relatives on the island seemed " miserable , degraded savages " , and he no longer saw an unbridgeable gap between humans and animals . As the Beagle neared England in 1836 , he noted that species might not be fixed .
Sichuan has been historically known as the " Province of Abundance " . It is one of the major agricultural production bases of China . Grain , including rice and wheat , is the major product with output that ranked first in China in 1999 . Commercial crops include citrus fruits , sugar cane , sweet potatoes , peaches and grapes . Sichuan also had the largest output of pork among all the provinces and the second largest output of silkworm cocoons in 1999 . Sichuan is rich in mineral resources . It has more than 132 kinds of proven underground mineral resources including vanadium , titanium , and lithium being the largest in China . The Panxi region alone possesses 13.3 % of the reserves of iron , 93 % of titanium , 69 % of vanadium , and 83 % of the cobalt of the whole country . Sichuan also possesses China 's largest proven natural gas reserves , the majority of which is transported to more developed eastern regions .
The languages have not undergone the deliberate highlighting of minor linguistic differences in the name of nationalism as has occurred in the Bosnian , Serbian and Croatian standards of Serbo-Croatian . However , most Slavic languages ( including Czech ) have been distanced in this way from Russian influences because of widespread public resentment against the former Soviet Union ( which occupied Czechoslovakia in 1968 ) . Czech and Slovak form a dialect continuum , with great similarity between neighboring Czech and Slovak dialects . ( See " Dialects " below . )
During the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism , much of London passing from church to private ownership . The traffic in woollen cloths shipped undyed and undressed from London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries , where it was considered indispensable . But the tentacles of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe . The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps ; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan . Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565 , there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity . The Royal Exchange was founded . Mercantilism grew , and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established , with trade expanding to the New World . London became the principal North Sea port , with migrants arriving from England and abroad . The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605 .
A unit load is defined as 100 mA in USB 1.x and 2.0 , and 150 mA in USB 3.0 . A device may draw a maximum of five unit loads from a port in USB 1.x and 2.0 ( 500 mA ) , or six unit loads in USB 3.0 ( 900 mA ) . There are two types of devices : low-power and high-power . A low-power device ( such as a USB HID ) draws at most one-unit load , with minimum operating voltage of 4.4 V in USB 2.0 , and 4 V in USB 3.0 . A high-power device draws , at most , the maximum number of unit loads the standard permits . Every device functions initially as low-power ( including high-power functions during their low-power enumeration phases ) , but may request high-power , and get it if available on the providing bus .
Another example relates to AIG , which insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps . The basic CDS transaction involved AIG receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party A in the event party B defaulted . However , AIG did not have the financial strength to support its many CDS commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in September 2008 . U.S. taxpayers provided over $ 180 billion in government support to AIG during 2008 and early 2009 , through which the money flowed to various counterparties to CDS transactions , including many large global financial institutions .
Until recently , in the absence of prior agreement on a clear and precise definition , the concept was thought to mean ( as a shorthand ) 'a division of sovereignty between two levels of government ' . New research , however , argues that this can not be correct , as dividing sovereignty - when this concept is properly understood in its core meaning of the final and absolute source of political authority in a political community - is not possible . The descent of the United States into Civil War in the mid-nineteenth century , over disputes about unallocated competences concerning slavery and ultimately the right of secession , showed this . One or other level of government could be sovereign to decide such matters , but not both simultaneously . Therefore , it is now suggested that federalism is more appropriately conceived as 'a division of the powers flowing from sovereignty between two levels of government ' . What differentiates the concept from other multi-level political forms is the characteristic of equality of standing between the two levels of government established . This clarified definition opens the way to identifying two distinct federal forms , where before only one was known , based upon whether sovereignty resides in the whole ( in one people ) or in the parts ( in many peoples ) : the federal state ( or federation ) and the federal union of states ( or federal union ) , respectively . Leading examples of the federal state include the United States , Germany , Canada , Switzerland , Australia and India . The leading example of the federal union of states is the European Union .
The Jenkins Orphanage was established in 1891 by the Rev . Daniel J. Jenkins in Charleston . The orphanage accepted donations of musical instruments and Rev . Jenkins hired local Charleston musicians and Avery Institute Graduates to tutor the boys in music . As a result , Charleston musicians became proficient on a variety of instruments and were able to read music expertly . These traits set Jenkins musicians apart and helped land some of them positions in big bands with Duke Ellington and Count Basie . William " Cat " Anderson , Jabbo Smith , and Freddie Green are but a few of the alumni from the Jenkins Orphanage band who became professional musicians in some of the best bands of the day . Orphanages around the country began to develop brass bands in the wake of the Jenkins Orphanage Band 's success . At the Colored Waif 's Home Brass Band in New Orleans , for example , a young trumpeter named Louis Armstrong first began to draw attention .
The United Nations Charter states that treaties must be registered with the UN to be invoked before it or enforced in its judiciary organ , the International Court of Justice . This was done to prevent the proliferation of secret treaties that occurred in the 19th and 20th century . Section 103 of the Charter also states that its members ' obligations under it outweigh any competing obligations under other treaties .
Von Neumann 's principal contribution to the atomic bomb was in the concept and design of the explosive lenses needed to compress the plutonium core of the Fat Man weapon that was later dropped on Nagasaki . While von Neumann did not originate the " implosion " concept , he was one of its most persistent proponents , encouraging its continued development against the instincts of many of his colleagues , who felt such a design to be unworkable . He also eventually came up with the idea of using more powerful shaped charges and less fissionable material to greatly increase the speed of " assembly " .
The 150th anniversary of Bell 's birth in 1997 was marked by a special issue of commemorative £1 banknotes from the Royal Bank of Scotland . The illustrations on the reverse of the note include Bell 's face in profile , his signature , and objects from Bell 's life and career : users of the telephone over the ages ; an audio wave signal ; a diagram of a telephone receiver ; geometric shapes from engineering structures ; representations of sign language and the phonetic alphabet ; the geese which helped him to understand flight ; and the sheep which he studied to understand genetics . Additionally , the Government of Canada honored Bell in 1997 with a C $ 100 gold coin , in tribute also to the 150th anniversary of his birth , and with a silver dollar coin in 2009 in honor of the 100th anniversary of flight in Canada . That first flight was made by an airplane designed under Dr. Bell 's tutelage , named the Silver Dart . Bell 's image , and also those of his many inventions have graced paper money , coinage and postal stamps in numerous countries worldwide for many dozens of years .
In its first century and half , the EIC used a few hundred soldiers as guards . The great expansion came after 1750 , when it had 3000 regular troops . By 1763 , it had 26,000 ; by 1778 , it had 67,000 . It recruited largely Indian troops , and trained them along European lines . The company , fresh from a colossal victory , and with the backing of its own private well-disciplined and experienced army , was able to assert its interests in the Carnatic region from its base at Madras and in Bengal from Calcutta , without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers .
Jewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets . Jewish law requires Jews to feed dogs ( and other animals that they own ) before themselves , and make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them . In Christianity , dogs represent faithfulness .
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the ultimate court for criminal and civil matters in England , Wales and Northern Ireland and for civil matters in Scotland . ( The supreme court for criminal matters in Scotland is the High Court of Justiciary . ) The Supreme Court was established by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 with effect from 1 October 2009 , replacing and assuming the judicial functions of the House of Lords . Devolution issues under the Scotland Act 1998 , Government of Wales Act and Northern Ireland Act were also transferred to the new Supreme Court by the Constitutional Reform Act , from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council .
East 2nd Street begins just North of East Houston Street at Avenue C and also continues to Bowery . The East end of East 3rd , 4th , 5th , and 7th Streets is Avenue D , with East 6th Street continuing further Eastward and connecting to FDR Drive .
In 2012 , resident foreigners made up 23.3 % of the population . Most of these ( 64 % ) were from European Union or EFTA countries . Italians were the largest single group of foreigners with 15.6 % of total foreign population . They were closely followed by Germans ( 15.2 % ) , immigrants from Portugal ( 12.7 % ) , France ( 5.6 % ) , Serbia ( 5.3 % ) , Turkey ( 3.8 % ) , Spain ( 3.7 % ) , and Austria ( 2 % ) . Immigrants from Sri Lanka , most of them former Tamil refugees , were the largest group among people of Asian origin ( 6.3 % ) . Additionally , the figures from 2012 show that 34.7 % of the permanent resident population aged 15 or over in Switzerland , i.e . 2,335,000 persons , had an immigrant background . A third of this population ( 853,000 ) held Swiss citizenship . Four fifths of persons with an immigration background were themselves immigrants ( first generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens ) , whereas one fifth were born in Switzerland ( second generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens ) . In the 2000s , domestic and international institutions expressed concern about what they perceived as an increase in xenophobia , particularly in some political campaigns . In reply to one critical report the Federal Council noted that " racism unfortunately is present in Switzerland " , but stated that the high proportion of foreign citizens in the country , as well as the generally unproblematic integration of foreigners " , underlined Switzerland 's openness .
In an effort at revitalizing the city , New Jersey voters in 1976 passed a referendum , approving casino gambling for Atlantic City ; this came after a 1974 referendum on legalized gambling failed to pass . Immediately after the legislation passed , the owners of the Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel began converting it into the Resorts International . It was the first legal casino in the eastern United States when it opened on May 26 , 1978 . Other casinos were soon constructed along the Boardwalk and , later , in the marina district for a total of eleven today . The introduction of gambling did not , however , quickly eliminate many of the urban problems that plagued Atlantic City . Many people have suggested that it only served to exacerbate those problems , as attested to by the stark contrast between tourism intensive areas and the adjacent impoverished working-class neighborhoods . In addition , Atlantic City has been less popular than Las Vegas , as a gambling city in the United States . Donald Trump helped bring big name boxing bouts to the city to attract customers to his casinos . The boxer Mike Tyson had most of his fights in Atlantic City in the 1980s , which helped Atlantic City achieve nationwide attention as a gambling resort . Numerous highrise condominiums were built for use as permanent residences or second homes . By end of the decade it was one of the most popular tourist destinations in the United States .
The State of Israel is divided into six main administrative districts , known as mehozot ( מחוזות ; singular : mahoz ) – Center , Haifa , Jerusalem , North , Southern , and Tel Aviv Districts , as well as the Judea and Samaria Area in the West Bank . All of the Judea and Samaria Area and parts of the Jerusalem and North districts are not recognized internationally as part of Israel . Districts are further divided into fifteen sub-districts known as nafot ( נפות ; singular : nafa ) , which are themselves partitioned into fifty natural regions .

Effective verbal or spoken communication is dependent on a number of factors and can not be fully isolated from other important interpersonal skills such as non-verbal communication , listening skills and clarification . Human language can be defined as a system of symbols ( sometimes known as lexemes ) and the grammars ( rules ) by which the symbols are manipulated . The word " language " also refers to common properties of languages . Language learning normally occurs most intensively during human childhood . Most of the thousands of human languages use patterns of sound or gesture for symbols which enable communication with others around them . Languages tend to share certain properties , although there are exceptions . There is no defined line between a language and a dialect . Constructed languages such as Esperanto , programming languages , and various mathematical formalism is not necessarily restricted to the properties shared by human languages . Communication is two-way process not merely one-way .
Having initially announced a new album entitled So Help Me God slated for a 2014 release , in March 2015 West announced that the album would instead be tentatively called SWISH . Later that month , West was awarded an honorary doctorate by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for his contributions to music , fashion , and popular culture , officially making him an honorary DFA . The next month , West headlined at the Glastonbury Festival in the UK , despite a petition signed by almost 135,000 people against his appearance . At one point , he told the audience : " You are now watching the greatest living rock star on the planet . " Media outlets , including social media sites such as Twitter , were sharply divided on his performance . NME stated , " The decision to book West for the slot has proved controversial since its announcement , and the show itself appeared to polarise both Glastonbury goers and those who tuned in to watch on their TVs . " The publication added that " he 's letting his music speak for and prove itself . " The Guardian said that " his set has a potent ferocity – but there are gaps and stutters , and he cuts a strangely lone figure in front of the vast crowd . "
Native American music in North America is almost entirely monophonic , but there are notable exceptions . Traditional Native American music often centers around drumming . Rattles , clappersticks , and rasps were also popular percussive instruments . Flutes were made of rivercane , cedar , and other woods . The tuning of these flutes is not precise and depends on the length of the wood used and the hand span of the intended player , but the finger holes are most often around a whole step apart and , at least in Northern California , a flute was not used if it turned out to have an interval close to a half step . The Apache fiddle is a single stringed instrument .
For centuries , Jews worldwide have spoken the local or dominant languages of the regions they migrated to , often developing distinctive dialectal forms or branches that became independent languages . Yiddish is the Judæo-German language developed by Ashkenazi Jews who migrated to Central Europe . Ladino is the Judæo-Spanish language developed by Sephardic Jews who migrated to the Iberian peninsula . Due to many factors , including the impact of the Holocaust on European Jewry , the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries , and widespread emigration from other Jewish communities around the world , ancient and distinct Jewish languages of several communities , including Judæo-Georgian , Judæo-Arabic , Judæo-Berber , Krymchak , Judæo-Malayalam and many others , have largely fallen out of use .
Between the 1992–93 season and the 2012–13 season , Premier League clubs had won the UEFA Champions League four times ( as well as supplying five of the runners-up ) , behind Spain 's La Liga with six wins , and Italy 's Serie A with five wins , and ahead of , among others , Germany 's Bundesliga with three wins ( see table here ) . The FIFA Club World Cup ( or the FIFA Club World Championship , as it was originally called ) has been won by Premier league clubs once ( Manchester United in 2008 ) , and they have also been runners-up twice , behind Brazil 's Brasileirão with four wins , and Spain 's La Liga and Italy 's Serie A with two wins each ( see table here ) .
Following the events in Olympia , there were reports that China requested permission to deploy People 's Liberation Army personnel along the relay route to protect the flame in Canberra . Australian authorities stated that such a request , if it were to be made , would be refused . Chinese officials labeled it a rumor . Australian police have been given powers to search relay spectators , following a call by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association for Chinese Australian students to " go defend our sacred torch " against " ethnic degenerate scum and anti-China separatists " . Tony Goh , chairman of the Australian Council of Chinese Organisations , has said the ACCO would be taking " thousands " of pro-Beijing demonstrators to Canberra by bus , to support the torch relay . Zhang Rongan , a Chinese Australian student organising pro-Beijing demonstrations , told the press that Chinese diplomats were assisting with the organization of buses , meals and accommodation for pro-Beijing demonstrators , and helping them organise a " peaceful show of strength " . Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said Chinese officials were urging supporters to " turn up and put a point of view " , but that he had no objection to it as long as they remained peaceful .
According to the U.S. Census Bureau , as of 2015 , Tennessee had an estimated population of 6,600,299 , which is an increase of 50,947 , from the prior year and an increase of 254,194 , or 4.01 % , since the year 2010 . This includes a natural increase since the last census of 142,266 people ( that is 493,881 births minus 351,615 deaths ) , and an increase from net migration of 219,551 people into the state . Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 59,385 people , and migration within the country produced a net increase of 160,166 people . Twenty percent of Tennesseans were born outside the South in 2008 , compared to a figure of 13.5 % in 1990 .
In 2006 , due to ongoing violence , over 50,000 people in the country 's northwest were at risk of starvation but this was averted due to assistance from the United Nations . [ citation needed ] On 8 January 2008 , the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon declared that the Central African Republic was eligible to receive assistance from the Peacebuilding Fund . Three priority areas were identified : first , the reform of the security sector ; second , the promotion of good governance and the rule of law ; and third , the revitalization of communities affected by conflicts . On 12 June 2008 , the Central African Republic requested assistance from the UN Peacebuilding Commission , which was set up in 2005 to help countries emerging from conflict avoid devolving back into war or chaos .
Spielberg followed with War Horse , shot in England in the summer of 2010 . It was released just four days after The Adventures of Tintin , on December 25 , 2011 . The film , based on the novel of the same name written by Michael Morpurgo and published in 1982 , follows the long friendship between a British boy and his horse Joey before and during World War I – the novel was also adapted into a hit play in London which is still running there , as well as on Broadway . The film was released and distributed by Disney , with whom DreamWorks made a distribution deal in 2009 . War Horse received generally positive reviews from critics , and was nominated for six Academy Awards , including Best Picture .
By 1790 , the Jewish population of Alsace was approximately 22,500 , about 3 % of the provincial population . They were highly segregated and subject to long-standing anti-Jewish regulations . They maintained their own customs , Yiddish language , and historic traditions within the tightly-knit ghettos ; they adhered to Talmudic law enforced by their rabbis . Jews were barred from most cities and instead lived in villages . They concentrated in trade , services , and especially in money lending . They financed about a third of the mortgages in Alsace . Official tolerance grew during the French Revolution , with full emancipation in 1791 . However , local antisemitism also increased and Napoleon turned hostile in 1806 , imposing a one-year moratorium on all debts owed to Jews . [ citation needed ] In the 1830-1870 era most Jews moved to the cities , where they integrated and acculturated , as antisemitism sharply declined . By 1831 , the state began paying salaries to official rabbis , and in 1846 a special legal oath for Jews was discontinued . Antisemitic local riots occasionally occurred , especially during the Revolution of 1848 . Merger of Alsace into Germany in 1871-1918 lessened antisemitic violence .
Rowing has been popular in Philadelphia since the 18th century . Boathouse Row is a symbol of Philadelphia 's rich rowing history , and each Big Five member has its own boathouse . Philadelphia hosts numerous local and collegiate rowing clubs and competitions , including the annual Dad Vail Regatta , the largest intercollegiate rowing event in the U.S , the Stotesbury Cup Regatta , and the Head of the Schuylkill Regatta , all of which are held on the Schuylkill River . The regattas are hosted and organized by the Schuylkill Navy , an association of area rowing clubs that has produced numerous Olympic rowers .
In December 1831 , he joined the Beagle expedition as a gentleman naturalist and geologist . He read Charles Lyell 's Principles of Geology and from the first stop ashore , at St. Jago , found Lyell 's uniformitarianism a key to the geological history of landscapes . Darwin discovered fossils resembling huge armadillos , and noted the geographical distribution of modern species in hope of finding their " centre of creation " . The three Fuegian missionaries the expedition returned to Tierra del Fuego were friendly and civilised , yet to Darwin their relatives on the island seemed " miserable , degraded savages " , and he no longer saw an unbridgeable gap between humans and animals . As the Beagle neared England in 1836 , he noted that species might not be fixed .
The iPod line can play several audio file formats including MP3 , AAC/M4A , Protected AAC , AIFF , WAV , Audible audiobook , and Apple Lossless . The iPod photo introduced the ability to display JPEG , BMP , GIF , TIFF , and PNG image file formats . Fifth and sixth generation iPod Classics , as well as third generation iPod Nanos , can additionally play MPEG-4 ( H.264/MPEG-4 AVC ) and QuickTime video formats , with restrictions on video dimensions , encoding techniques and data-rates . Originally , iPod software only worked with Mac OS ; iPod software for Microsoft Windows was launched with the second generation model . Unlike most other media players , Apple does not support Microsoft 's WMA audio format—but a converter for WMA files without Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) is provided with the Windows version of iTunes . MIDI files also can not be played , but can be converted to audio files using the " Advanced " menu in iTunes . Alternative open-source audio formats , such as Ogg Vorbis and FLAC , are not supported without installing custom firmware onto an iPod ( e.g. , Rockbox ) .
A format called quiet storm is often included in urban adult contemporary , and is often played during the evening , blending the urban AC and soft AC styles of music . The music that is played is strictly ballads and slow jams , mostly but not limited to Black and Latino artists . Popular artists in the quiet storm format are Teena Marie , Freddie Jackson , Johnny Gill , Lalah Hathaway , Vanessa L. Williams , Toni Braxton , and En Vogue among others .
The BBC reported that France was the first journalist to face trial and be convicted under Operation Elveden since the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) had revised its guidance in April 2015 so that prosecutions would only be brought against journalists who had made payments to police officers over a period of time . As a result of the change in the CPS’ policy , charges against several journalists who had made payments to other types of public officials – including civil servants , health workers and prison staff - had been dropped . In July 2015 , Private Eye magazine reported that at a costs hearing at the Old Bailey The Sun 's parent company had refused to pay for the prosecution costs relating to France’s trial , leading the presiding judge to express his " considerable disappointment " at this state of affairs . Judge Timothy Pontius said in court that France’s illegal actions had been part of a " clearly recognised procedure at The Sun " , adding that , " There can be no doubt that News International bears some measure of moral responsibility if not legal culpability for the acts of the defendant " . The Private Eye report noted that despite this The Sun 's parent organisation was " considering disciplinary actions " against France whilst at the same time it was also preparing to bring a case to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal against the London Metropolitan Police Service for its actions relating to him and two other journalists .
As economic and demographic methods were applied to the study of history , the trend was increasingly to see the late Middle Ages as a period of recession and crisis . Belgian historian Henri Pirenne continued the subdivision of Early , High , and Late Middle Ages in the years around World War I . Yet it was his Dutch colleague , Johan Huizinga , who was primarily responsible for popularising the pessimistic view of the Late Middle Ages , with his book The Autumn of the Middle Ages ( 1919 ) . To Huizinga , whose research focused on France and the Low Countries rather than Italy , despair and decline were the main themes , not rebirth .
The traditional energy supply of Thuringia is lignite , mined in the bordering Leipzig region . Since 2000 , the importance of environmentally unfriendly lignite combustion has declined in favour of renewable energies , which reached an amount of 40 % ( in 2013 ) , and more clean gas combustion , often carried out as Cogeneration in the municipal power stations . The most important forms of renewable energies are Wind power and Biomass , followed by Solar energy and Hydroelectricity . Furthermore , Thuringia hosts two big pumped storage stations : the Goldisthal Pumped Storage Station and the Hohenwarte Dam .
The Islamic Golden Age coincided with the Middle Ages in the Muslim world , starting with the rise of Islam and establishment of the first Islamic state in 622 . The end of the age is variously given as 1258 with the Mongolian Sack of Baghdad , or 1492 with the completion of the Christian Reconquista of the Emirate of Granada in Al-Andalus , Iberian Peninsula . During the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun ar-Rashid ( 786 to 809 ) , the legendary House of Wisdom was inaugurated in Baghdad where scholars from various parts of the world sought to translate and gather all the known world 's knowledge into Arabic . The Abbasids were influenced by the Quranic injunctions and hadiths , such as " the ink of a scholar is more holy than the blood of a martyr , " that stressed the value of knowledge . The major Islamic capital cities of Baghdad , Cairo , and Córdoba became the main intellectual centers for science , philosophy , medicine , and education . During this period , the Muslim world was a collection of cultures ; they drew together and advanced the knowledge gained from the ancient Greek , Roman , Persian , Chinese , Indian , Egyptian , and Phoenician civilizations .
People of all ages attend , and many often move on to becoming imams . [ citation needed ] The certificate of an ʻālim , for example , requires approximately twelve years of study . [ citation needed ] A good number of the ḥuffāẓ ( plural of ḥāfiẓ ) are the product of the madaris . The madaris also resemble colleges , where people take evening classes and reside in dormitories . An important function of the madaris is to admit orphans and poor children in order to provide them with education and training . Madaris may enroll female students ; however , they study separately from the men . [ citation needed ]
Another recent environmental issue in Melbourne was the Victorian government project of channel deepening Melbourne Ports by dredging Port Phillip Bay—the Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project . It was subject to controversy and strict regulations among fears that beaches and marine wildlife could be affected by the disturbance of heavy metals and other industrial sediments . Other major pollution problems in Melbourne include levels of bacteria including E. coli in the Yarra River and its tributaries caused by septic systems , as well as litter . Up to 350,000 cigarette butts enter the storm water runoff every day . Several programs are being implemented to minimise beach and river pollution . In February 2010 , The Transition Decade , an initiative to transition human society , economics and environment towards sustainability , was launched in Melbourne .
Darwin had initially decided to call his book An abstract of an Essay on the Origin of Species and Varieties Through natural selection , but with Murray 's persuasion it was eventually changed to the snappier title : On the Origin of Species , with the title page adding by Means of Natural Selection , or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life . Here the term " races " is used as an alternative for " varieties " and does not carry the modern connotation of human races—the first use in the book refers to " the several races , for instance , of the cabbage " and proceeds to a discussion of " the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants " .
Cockroaches are among the fastest insect runners and , at full speed , adopt a bipedal run to reach a high velocity in proportion to their body size . As cockroaches move very quickly , they need to be video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait . More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks ( Phasmatodea ) . A few insects have evolved to walk on the surface of the water , especially members of the Gerridae family , commonly known as water striders . A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans , a habitat that has few insect species .
Friedrich Hayek CH ( German : [ ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈaʊ̯ɡʊst ˈhaɪ̯ɛk ] ; 8 May 1899 – 23 March 1992 ) , born in Austria-Hungary as Friedrich August von Hayek and frequently referred to as F. A. Hayek , was an Austrian and British economist and philosopher best known for his defense of classical liberalism . Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for his " pioneering work in the theory of money and economic fluctuations and ... penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic , social and institutional phenomena . "
After a lengthy period of formal racial segregation in the former Confederacy following the Reconstruction Era , and bans on interracial marriage in various parts of the country , more people are openly forming interracial unions . In addition , social conditions have changed and many multiracial people do not believe it is socially advantageous to try to " pass " as white . Diverse immigration has brought more mixed-race people into the United States , such as the large population of Hispanics identifying as mestizos . Since the 1980s , the United States has had a growing multiracial identity movement ( cf . Loving Day ) . Because more Americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins , the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one ethno-racial identity and thereby identify as multiracial . In 2008 Barack Obama was elected as the first multiracial President of the United States ; he acknowledges both sides of his family and identifies as African American .
Commentaries dealing with the zahir ( outward aspects ) of the text are called tafsir , and hermeneutic and esoteric commentaries dealing with the batin are called ta'wil ( " interpretation " or " explanation " ) , which involves taking the text back to its beginning . Commentators with an esoteric slant believe that the ultimate meaning of the Quran is known only to God . In contrast , Quranic literalism , followed by Salafis and Zahiris , is the belief that the Quran should only be taken at its apparent meaning . [ citation needed ]
Many causes for the financial crisis have been suggested , with varying weight assigned by experts . The U.S. Senate 's Levin–Coburn Report concluded that the crisis was the result of " high risk , complex financial products ; undisclosed conflicts of interest ; the failure of regulators , the credit rating agencies , and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street . " The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by " widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision " , " dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions " , " a combination of excessive borrowing , risky investments , and lack of transparency " by financial institutions , ill preparation and inconsistent action by government that " added to the uncertainty and panic " , a " systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics " , " collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline " , deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives , especially credit default swaps , and " the failures of credit rating agencies " to correctly price risk . The 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the United States . Critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products , and that governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address 21st-century financial markets . Research into the causes of the financial crisis has also focused on the role of interest rate spreads .
Kerry established a separate political action committee , Keeping America 's Promise , which declared as its mandate " A Democratic Congress will restore accountability to Washington and help change a disastrous course in Iraq " , and raised money and channeled contributions to Democratic candidates in state and federal races . Through Keeping America 's Promise in 2005 , Kerry raised over $ 5.5 million for other Democrats up and down the ballot . Through his campaign account and his political action committee , the Kerry campaign operation generated more than $ 10 million for various party committees and 179 candidates for the U.S. House , Senate , state and local offices in 42 states focusing on the midterm elections during the 2006 election cycle . " Cumulatively , John Kerry has done as much if not more than any other individual senator " , Hassan Nemazee , the national finance chairman of the DSCC said .
According to historian Shaye J. D. Cohen , the status of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined patrilineally in the Bible . He brings two likely explanations for the change in Mishnaic times : first , the Mishnah may have been applying the same logic to mixed marriages as it had applied to other mixtures ( Kil'ayim ) . Thus , a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a horse and a donkey , and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally . Second , the Tannaim may have been influenced by Roman law , which dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage , offspring would follow the mother .
Widowed in 1861 , the grief-stricken Queen withdrew from public life and left Buckingham Palace to live at Windsor Castle , Balmoral Castle and Osborne House . For many years the palace was seldom used , even neglected . In 1864 , a note was found pinned to the fence of Buckingham Palace , saying : " These commanding premises to be let or sold , in consequence of the late occupant 's declining business . " Eventually , public opinion forced the Queen to return to London , though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible . Court functions were still held at Windsor Castle , presided over by the sombre Queen habitually dressed in mourning black , while Buckingham Palace remained shuttered for most of the year .
Southeast Tucson continues to experience rapid residential development . The area includes Davis-Monthan Air Force Base . The area is considered to be south of Golf Links Road . It is the home of Santa Rita High School , Chuck Ford Park ( Lakeside Park ) , Lakeside Lake , Lincoln Park ( upper and lower ) , The Lakecrest Neighborhoods , and Pima Community College East Campus . The Atterbury Wash with its access to excellent bird watching is also located in the Southeast Tucson area . The suburban community of Rita Ranch houses many of the military families from Davis-Monthan , and is near the southeastern-most expansion of the current city limits . Close by Rita Ranch and also within the city limits lies Civano , a planned development meant to showcase ecologically sound building practices and lifestyles .
Other stories result from a natural rivalry between two or more characters . Outside of performance , these are referred to as feuds . A feud can exist between any number of participants and can last for a few days up to multiple decades . The feud between Ric Flair and Ricky Steamboat lasted from the late 1970s into the early 1990s and allegedly spanned over two thousand matches ( although most of those matches were mere dark matches ) . The career-spanning history between characters Mike Awesome and Masato Tanaka is another example of a long-running feud , as is the case of Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Mr. McMahon , one of the most lucrative feuds in the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) during 1998 and 1999 .
In 1986 , the Compact of Free Association with the United States entered into force , granting the Republic of the Marshall Islands ( RMI ) its sovereignty . The Compact provided for aid and U.S. defense of the islands in exchange for continued U.S. military use of the missile testing range at Kwajalein Atoll . The independence procedure was formally completed under international law in 1990 , when the UN officially ended the Trusteeship status pursuant to Security Council Resolution 683 .
Literary Catalan allows the use of words from different dialects , except those of very restricted use . However , from the 19th century onwards , there is a tendency of favoring words of Northern dialects in detriment of others , even though nowadays there is a greater freedom of choice .
The name evolved during the Middle Ages from Gallaecia , sometimes written Galletia , to Gallicia . In the 13th century , with the written emergence of the Galician language , Galiza became the most usual written form of the name of the country , being replaced during the 15th and 16th centuries by the current form , Galicia , which coincides with the Castilian Spanish name . The historical denomination Galiza became popular again during the end of the 19th and the first three-quarters of the 20th century , being still used with some frequency today , although not by the Xunta de Galicia , the local devolved government . The Royal Galician Academy , the institution responsible for regulating the Galician language , whilst recognizing it as a legitimate current denomination , has stated that the only official name of the country is Galicia .
In recent decades , a series of inscribed graphs and pictures have been found at Neolithic sites in China , including Jiahu ( c. 6500 BC ) , Dadiwan and Damaidi from the 6th millennium BC , and Banpo ( 5th millennium BC ) . Often these finds are accompanied by media reports that push back the purported beginnings of Chinese writing by thousands of years . However , because these marks occur singly , without any implied context , and are made crudely and simply , Qiu Xigui concluded that " we do not have any basis for stating that these constituted writing nor is there reason to conclude that they were ancestral to Shang dynasty Chinese characters . " They do however demonstrate a history of sign use in the Yellow River valley during the Neolithic through to the Shang period .
Armies typically have air defence in depth , from integral MANPADS such as the RBS 70 , Stinger and Igla at smaller force levels up to army-level missile defence systems such as Angara and Patriot . Often , the high-altitude long-range missile systems force aircraft to fly at low level , where anti-aircraft guns can bring them down . As well as the small and large systems , for effective air defence there must be intermediate systems . These may be deployed at regiment-level and consist of platoons of self-propelled anti-aircraft platforms , whether they are self-propelled anti-aircraft guns ( SPAAGs ) , integrated air-defence systems like Tunguska or all-in-one surface-to-air missile platforms like Roland or SA-8 Gecko .
RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it , but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes , therefore the CPU can only read from it . ROM is typically used to store the computer 's initial start-up instructions . In general , the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off , but ROM retains its data indefinitely . In a PC , the ROM contains a specialized program called the BIOS that orchestrates loading the computer 's operating system from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset . In embedded computers , which frequently do not have disk drives , all of the required software may be stored in ROM . Software stored in ROM is often called firmware , because it is notionally more like hardware than software . Flash memory blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM , as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable . It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however , so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary .
In 1348 and 1349 Portugal , like the rest of Europe , was devastated by the Black Death . In 1373 , Portugal made an alliance with England , which is the longest-standing alliance in the world . This alliance served both nations ' interests throughout history and is regarded by many as the predecessor to NATO . Over time this went way beyond geo-political and military cooperation ( protecting both nations ' interests in Africa , the Americas and Asia against French , Spanish and Dutch rivals ) and maintained strong trade and cultural ties between the two old European allies . Particularly in the Oporto region , there is visible English influence to this day .
The effects of local surface low pressure are extremely limited because upper-level subsidence still continues to block any form of air ascent . Also , to be protected against rain-bearing weather systems by the atmospheric circulation itself , the desert is made even drier by his geographical configuration and location . Indeed , the extreme aridity of the Sahara ca n't be only explained by the subtropical high pressure . The Atlas Mountains , found in Algeria , Morocco and Tunisia also help to enhance the aridity of the northern part of the desert . These major mountain ranges act as a barrier causing a strong rain shadow effect on the leeward side by dropping much of the humidity brought by atmospheric disturbances along the polar front which affects the surrounding Mediterranean climates .
The Hummers that Schwarzenegger bought 1992 are so large – each weighs 6,300 lb ( 2,900 kg ) and is 7 feet ( 2.1 m ) wide – that they are classified as large trucks , and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to them . During the gubernatorial recall campaign he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen . The conversion was reported to have cost about US $ 21,000 . After the election , he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the California Hydrogen Highway Network , and gained a U.S. Department of Energy grant to help pay for its projected US $ 91,000,000 cost . California took delivery of the first H2H ( Hydrogen Hummer ) in October 2004 .
New Mexico is commonly thought to have Spanish as an official language alongside English because of its wide usage and legal promotion of Spanish in the state ; however , the state has no official language . New Mexico 's laws are promulgated bilingually in Spanish and English . Although English is the state government 's paper working language , government business is often conducted in Spanish , particularly at the local level . Spanish has been spoken in the New Mexico-Colorado border and the contemporary U.S.–Mexico border since the 16th century . [ citation needed ]
Two days after the marriage , Bonaparte left Paris to take command of the Army of Italy . He immediately went on the offensive , hoping to defeat the forces of Piedmont before their Austrian allies could intervene . In a series of rapid victories during the Montenotte Campaign , he knocked Piedmont out of the war in two weeks . The French then focused on the Austrians for the remainder of the war , the highlight of which became the protracted struggle for Mantua . The Austrians launched a series of offensives against the French to break the siege , but Napoleon defeated every relief effort , scoring notable victories at the battles of Castiglione , Bassano , Arcole , and Rivoli . The decisive French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy . At Rivoli , the Austrians lost up to 14,000 men while the French lost about 5,000 .
Nutrition is taught in schools in many countries . In England and Wales , the Personal and Social Education and Food Technology curricula include nutrition , stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition labels on packaging . In many schools , a Nutrition class will fall within the Family and Consumer Science or Health departments . In some American schools , students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes . Nutrition is offered at many schools , and , if it is not a class of its own , nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as : Life Skills , Independent Living , Single Survival , Freshmen Connection , Health etc . In many Nutrition classes , students learn about the food groups , the food pyramid , Daily Recommended Allowances , calories , vitamins , minerals , malnutrition , physical activity , healthful food choices , portion sizes , and how to live a healthy life .
The domestic dog ( Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris ) is a domesticated canid which has been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors , sensory capabilities , and physical attributes .
Because the Quran is spoken in classical Arabic , many of the later converts to Islam ( mostly non-Arabs ) did not always understand the Quranic Arabic , they did not catch allusions that were clear to early Muslims fluent in Arabic and they were concerned with reconciling apparent conflict of themes in the Quran . Commentators erudite in Arabic explained the allusions , and perhaps most importantly , explained which Quranic verses had been revealed early in Muhammad 's prophetic career , as being appropriate to the very earliest Muslim community , and which had been revealed later , canceling out or " abrogating " ( nāsikh ) the earlier text ( mansūkh ) . Other scholars , however , maintain that no abrogation has taken place in the Quran . The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has published a ten-volume Urdu commentary on the Quran , with the name Tafseer e Kabir .
After centuries of Danish , Swedish and German rule the native Estonians started to yearn for independence during the period of national awakening while being governed by the Russian Empire . Established on 24 February 1918 , the Republic of Estonia came into existence towards the end of World War I . During World War II , Estonia was then occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 , then Nazi Germany a year later and again in 1944 establishing the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic . In 1988 , during the Singing Revolution , the Estonian SSR issued the Estonian Sovereignty Declaration to defy against the illegal Soviet rule . Estonia then restored its independence during the 1991 coup by the Soviets on the night of 20 August 1991 .
Admissions are characterized as " most selective " by U.S. News & World Report . There were 35,099 applications for the undergraduate class of 2020 ( entering 2016 ) , and 3,751 ( 10.7 % ) were admitted , making Northwestern one of the most selective schools in the United States . For freshmen enrolling in the class of 2019 , the interquartile range ( middle 50 % ) on the SAT was 690–760 for critical reading and 710-800 for math , ACT composite scores for the middle 50 % ranged from 31–34 , and 91 % ranked in the top ten percent of their high school class .
By the time of John Seller 's Atlas Maritima of 1670 , " India Beyond the Ganges " had become " the East Indies " including China , Korea , southeast Asia and the islands of the Pacific in a map that was every bit as distorted as Ptolemy 's , despite the lapse of approximately 1500 years . That " east " in turn was only an English translation of Latin Oriens and Orientalis , " the land of the rising sun , " used since Roman times for " east . " The world map of Jodocus Hondius of 1590 labels all of Asia from the Caspian to the Pacific as India Orientalis , shortly to appear in translation as the East Indies .
During the administration of U.S. President Martin Van Buren , nearly 17,000 Cherokees—along with approximately 2,000 black slaves owned by Cherokees—were uprooted from their homes between 1838 and 1839 and were forced by the U.S. military to march from " emigration depots " in Eastern Tennessee ( such as Fort Cass ) toward the more distant Indian Territory west of Arkansas . During this relocation an estimated 4,000 Cherokees died along the way west . In the Cherokee language , the event is called Nunna daul Isunyi— " the Trail Where We Cried . " The Cherokees were not the only American Indians forced to emigrate as a result of the Indian removal efforts of the United States , and so the phrase " Trail of Tears " is sometimes used to refer to similar events endured by other American Indian peoples , especially among the " Five Civilized Tribes " . The phrase originated as a description of the earlier emigration of the Choctaw nation .
During encoding , 576 time-domain samples are taken and are transformed to 576 frequency-domain samples . [ clarification needed ] If there is a transient , 192 samples are taken instead of 576 . This is done to limit the temporal spread of quantization noise accompanying the transient . ( See psychoacoustics . )
The casualties were horrible , especially for the attacking Prussian forces . A grand total of 20,163 German troops were killed , wounded or missing in action during the August 18 battle . The French losses were 7,855 killed and wounded along with 4,420 prisoners of war ( half of them were wounded ) for a total of 12,275 . While most of the Prussians fell under the French Chassepot rifles , most French fell under the Prussian Krupp shells . In a breakdown of the casualties , Frossard 's II Corps of the Army of the Rhine suffered 621 casualties while inflicting 4,300 casualties on the Prussian First Army under Steinmetz before the Pointe du Jour . The Prussian Guards Infantry Divisions losses were even more staggering with 8,000 casualties out of 18,000 men . The Special Guards Jäger lost 19 officers , a surgeon and 431 men out of a total of 700 . The 2nd Guards Infantry Brigade lost 39 officers and 1,076 men . The 3rd Guards Infantry Brigade lost 36 officers and 1,060 men . On the French side , the units holding St. Privat lost more than half their number in the village .
Santa Bárbara became the launching place for expeditions into New Mexico by Spanish conquistadors like : Antonio de Espejo , Gaspar Castaño , Antonio Gutiérrez de Umaña , Francisco Leyba de Bonilla , and Vicente de Zaldívar . Several expeditions were led to find a shorter route from Santa Barbara to New Mexico . In April 1598 , Juan de Oñate finally found a short route from Santa Barbara to New Mexico which came to be called El Paso del Norte ( The Northern Pass ) . The discovery of El Paso Del Norte was important for the expansion of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro ( The Inner Land Royal Road ) to link Spanish settlements in New Mexico to Mexico City ; El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro facilitated transport of settlers and supplies to New Mexico .
The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals , the Soviet Union ( USSR ) and the United States ( US ) , for supremacy in spaceflight capability . It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II , enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel . The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security , and symbolic of ideological superiority . The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites , unmanned space probes of the Moon , Venus , and Mars , and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon . The competition began on August 2 , 1955 , when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year , by declaring they would also launch a satellite " in the near future " . The Soviet Union beat the US to this , with the October 4 , 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1 , and later beat the US to the first human in space , Yuri Gagarin , on April 12 , 1961 . The Space Race peaked with the July 20 , 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11 . The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions , and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations . A period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo–Soyuz Test Project , resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew .

The Slovenian countryside displays a variety of disguised groups and individual characters among which the most popular and characteristic is the Kurent ( plural : Kurenti ) , a monstrous and demon-like , but fluffy figure . The most significant festival is held in Ptuj ( see : Kurentovanje ) . Its special feature are the Kurents themselves , magical creatures from another world , who visit major events throughout the country , trying to banish the winter and announce spring 's arrival , fertility , and new life with noise and dancing . The origin of the Kurent is a mystery , and not much is known of the times , beliefs , or purposes connected with its first appearance . The origin of the name itself is obscure .
During the 20th century , the county became increasingly urbanised , particularly the southern part . To the existing county boroughs of Barrow-in-Furness , Blackburn , Bolton , Bootle , Burnley , Bury , Liverpool , Manchester , Oldham , Preston , Rochdale , Salford , St Helens and Wigan were added Blackpool ( 1904 ) , Southport ( 1905 ) , and Warrington ( 1900 ) . The county boroughs also had many boundary extensions . The borders around the Manchester area were particularly complicated , with narrow protrusions of the administrative county between the county boroughs – Lees urban district formed a detached part of the administrative county , between Oldham county borough and the West Riding of Yorkshire .

An estimated 20,000 Somalis emigrated to the U.S. state of Minnesota some ten years ago and the Twin Cities ( Minneapolis and Saint Paul ) now have the highest population of Somalis in North America . The city of Minneapolis hosts hundreds of Somali-owned and operated businesses offering a variety of products , including leather shoes , jewelry and other fashion items , halal meat , and hawala or money transfer services . Community-based video rental stores likewise carry the latest Somali films and music . The number of Somalis has especially surged in the Cedar-Riverside area of Minneapolis .
Beginning around 2005 , drug traffickers based in Latin America began to use Guinea-Bissau , along with several neighboring West African nations , as a transshipment point to Europe for cocaine . The nation was described by a United Nations official as being at risk for becoming a " narco-state " . The government and the military have done little to stop drug trafficking , which increased after the 2012 coup d'état .
Malaysia-based Yazhou Zhoukan conducted an interview with former researcher at the China Seismological Bureau Geng Qingguo ( 耿庆国 ) , in which Geng claimed that a confidential written report was sent to the State Seismological Bureau on April 30 , 2008 , warning about the possible occurrence of a significant earthquake in Ngawa Prefecture region of Sichuan around May 8 , with a range of 10 days before or after the quake . Geng , while acknowledging that earthquake prediction was broadly considered problematic by the scientific community , believed that " the bigger the earthquake , the easier it is to predict . " Geng had long attempted to establish a correlation between the occurrence of droughts and earthquakes ; Premier Zhou Enlai reportedly took an interest in Geng 's work . Geng 's drought-earthquake correlation theory was first released in 1972 , and said to have successfully predicted the 1975 Haicheng and 1976 Tangshan earthquakes . The same Yazhou Zhoukan article pointed out the inherent difficulties associated with predicting earthquakes . In response , an official with the Seismological Bureau stated that " earthquake prediction is widely acknowledged around the world to be difficult from a scientific standpoint . " The official also denied that the Seismological Bureau had received reports predicting the earthquake .
Mammals include the largest animals on the planet , the rorquals and other large whales , as well as some of the most intelligent , such as elephants , primates , including humans , and cetaceans . The basic body type is a four-legged land-borne animal , but some mammals are adapted for life at sea , in the air , in trees , or on two legs . The largest group of mammals , the placentals , have a placenta , which enables feeding the fetus during gestation . Mammals range in size from the 30–40 mm ( 1.2–1.6 in ) bumblebee bat to the 33-meter ( 108 ft ) blue whale .
It was granted its Royal Charter in 1837 under King William IV . Supplemental Charters of 1887 , 1909 and 1925 were replaced by a single Charter in 1971 , and there have been minor amendments since then .
In January 2015 , a customer named Ricardo Brown received a bill from Comcast with his name changed to " Asshole Brown " . Brown 's wife , Lisa , believed a Comcast employee changed the name in response to the Browns ' request to cancel their cable service , an incident in which she was refused a cancellation unless she paid a $ 60 fee and instead was routed to a retention specialist . Comcast refused to correct the name on their bill after bringing it to the attention of numerous customer service outlets for the company by explaining that Ricardo is the legal name of the customer , so the Browns turned to consumer advocate Christopher Elliott . Elliott posted the facts of the incident , along with a copy of the bill , on his blog . Shortly thereafter , Elliott contacted Comcast and Comcast offered the Browns an apology , a $ 60 refund , and a promise to track down and fire the responsible employee . The Browns instead requested a full refund for their negative experience and Comcast agreed to refund the family the last two years of service and provide the next two years of service at no charge . Comcast released a statement explaining : " We have spoken with our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name change . We have zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened . We are working with our customer to make this right and will take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again . "

During the Wisconsinan glaciation , the New York City region was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet over 1,000 feet in depth . The ice sheet scraped away large amounts of soil , leaving the bedrock that serves as the geologic foundation for much of New York City today . Later on , the ice sheet would help split apart what are now Long Island and Staten Island .
A minority view is that early seventeenth-century Baptists were influenced by ( but not directly connected to ) continental Anabaptists . According to this view , the General Baptists shared similarities with Dutch Waterlander Mennonites ( one of many Anabaptist groups ) including believer 's baptism only , religious liberty , separation of church and state , and Arminian views of salvation , predestination and original sin . Representative writers including A.C. Underwood and William R. Estep . Gourley wrote that among some contemporary Baptist scholars who emphasize the faith of the community over soul liberty , the Anabaptist influence theory is making a comeback .
Beginning in 2005 , the CBC has contributed production funds for the BBC Wales revival of Doctor Who , for which it received a special credit at the end of each episode . This arrangement continued until the end of fourth season , broadcast in 2008 . The CBC similarly contributed to the first season of the spin-off series , Torchwood . More recently , the network has also begun picking up Canadian rights to some Australian series , including the drama series Janet King and Love Child , and the comedy-drama series Please Like Me .
Endospores show no detectable metabolism and can survive extreme physical and chemical stresses , such as high levels of UV light , gamma radiation , detergents , disinfectants , heat , freezing , pressure , and desiccation . In this dormant state , these organisms may remain viable for millions of years , and endospores even allow bacteria to survive exposure to the vacuum and radiation in space . According to scientist Dr. Steinn Sigurdsson , " There are viable bacterial spores that have been found that are 40 million years old on Earth — and we know they 're very hardened to radiation . " Endospore-forming bacteria can also cause disease : for example , anthrax can be contracted by the inhalation of Bacillus anthracis endospores , and contamination of deep puncture wounds with Clostridium tetani endospores causes tetanus .
By the start of the 20th century , Germany and the United States challenged Britain 's economic lead . Subsequent military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the First World War , during which Britain relied heavily upon its empire . The conflict placed enormous strain on the military , financial and manpower resources of Britain . Although the British Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after World War I , Britain was no longer the world 's pre-eminent industrial or military power . In the Second World War , Britain 's colonies in South-East Asia were occupied by Imperial Japan . Despite the final victory of Britain and its allies , the damage to British prestige helped to accelerate the decline of the empire . India , Britain 's most valuable and populous possession , achieved independence as part of a larger decolonisation movement in which Britain granted independence to most territories of the Empire . The transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997 marked for many the end of the British Empire . Fourteen overseas territories remain under British sovereignty . After independence , many former British colonies joined the Commonwealth of Nations , a free association of independent states . The United Kingdom is now one of 16 Commonwealth nations , a grouping known informally as the Commonwealth realms , that share one monarch—Queen Elizabeth II .

According to Buddhist traditions a Buddha is a fully awakened being who has completely purified his mind of the three poisons of desire , aversion and ignorance . A Buddha is no longer bound by Samsara and has ended the suffering which unawakened people experience in life .
Hayek also wrote that the state can play a role in the economy , and specifically , in creating a " safety net " . He wrote , " There is no reason why , in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has , the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom ; that is : some minimum of food , shelter and clothing , sufficient to preserve health . Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision . "
In 1983 fighting between Palestinian refugees and Lebanese factions reignited that nation 's long-running civil war . A UN agreement brought an international force of peacekeepers to occupy Beirut and guarantee security . US Marines landed in August 1982 along with Italian and French forces . On October 23 , 1983 , a suicide bomber driving a truck filled with 6 tons of TNT crashed through a fence and destroyed the Marine barracks , killing 241 Marines ; seconds later , a second bomber leveled a French barracks , killing 58 . Subsequently the US Navy engaged in bombing of militia positions inside Lebanon . While US President Ronald Reagan was initially defiant , political pressure at home eventually forced the withdrawal of the Marines in February 1984 .
FBI Directors are appointed by the President of the United States . They must be confirmed by the United States Senate and serve a term of office of five years , with a maximum of ten years , if reappointed , unless they resign or are fired by the President before their term ends . J. Edgar Hoover , appointed by Calvin Coolidge in 1924 , was by far the longest-serving director , serving until his death in 1972 . In 1968 , Congress passed legislation as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act Pub.L . 90–351 , June 19 , 1968 , 82 Stat . 197 that specified a 10-year limit , a maximum of two 5-year terms , for future FBI Directors , as well as requiring Senate confirmation of appointees . As the incumbent , this legislation did not apply to Hoover , only to his successors . The current FBI Director is James B. Comey , who was appointed in 2013 by Barack Obama .
According to the Quran , God communicated with man and made his will known through signs and revelations . Prophets , or 'Messengers of God ' , received revelations and delivered them to humanity . The message has been identical and for all humankind . " Nothing is said to you that was not said to the messengers before you , that your lord has at his Command forgiveness as well as a most Grievous Penalty . " The revelation does not come directly from God to the prophets . Angels acting as God 's messengers deliver the divine revelation to them . This comes out in Quran 42:51 , in which it is stated : " It is not for any mortal that God should speak to them , except by revelation , or from behind a veil , or by sending a messenger to reveal by his permission whatsoever He will . "
Programming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run . Unlike natural languages , programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise . They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud . They are generally either translated into machine code by a compiler or an assembler before being run , or translated directly at run time by an interpreter . Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques .
Cladistics is a technique borrowed from biology , where it was originally named phylogenetic systematics by Willi Hennig . In biology , the technique is used to determine the evolutionary relationships between different species . In its application in textual criticism , the text of a number of different manuscripts is entered into a computer , which records all the differences between them . The manuscripts are then grouped according to their shared characteristics . The difference between cladistics and more traditional forms of statistical analysis is that , rather than simply arranging the manuscripts into rough groupings according to their overall similarity , cladistics assumes that they are part of a branching family tree and uses that assumption to derive relationships between them . This makes it more like an automated approach to stemmatics . However , where there is a difference , the computer does not attempt to decide which reading is closer to the original text , and so does not indicate which branch of the tree is the " root " —which manuscript tradition is closest to the original . Other types of evidence must be used for that purpose .
Some 97 percent of male BYU graduates and 32 percent of female graduates took a hiatus from their undergraduate studies at one point to serve as LDS missionaries . In October 2012 , the LDS Church announced at its general conference that young men could serve a mission after they turn 18 and have graduated from high school , rather than after age 19 under the old policy . Many young men would often attend a semester or two of higher education prior to beginning missionary service . This policy change will likely impact what has been the traditional incoming freshman class at BYU . Female students may now begin their missionary service anytime after turning 19 , rather than age 21 under the previous policy . For males , a full-time mission is two years in length , and for females it lasts 18 months .
The Districts of Germany ( Kreise ) are administrative districts , and every state except the city-states of Berlin , Hamburg , and Bremen consists of " rural districts " ( Landkreise ) , District-free Towns/Cities ( Kreisfreie Städte , in Baden-Württemberg also called " urban districts " , or Stadtkreise ) , cities that are districts in their own right , or local associations of a special kind ( Kommunalverbände besonderer Art ) , see below . The state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen consists of two urban districts , while Berlin and Hamburg are states and urban districts at the same time .
Bilateral treaties are concluded between two states or entities . It is possible , however , for a bilateral treaty to have more than two parties ; consider for instance the bilateral treaties between Switzerland and the European Union ( EU ) following the Swiss rejection of the European Economic Area agreement . Each of these treaties has seventeen parties . These however are still bilateral , not multilateral , treaties . The parties are divided into two groups , the Swiss ( " on the one part " ) and the EU and its member states ( " on the other part " ) . The treaty establishes rights and obligations between the Swiss and the EU and the member states severally—it does not establish any rights and obligations amongst the EU and its member states .

In some countries , such as Britain and Germany during the Second World War , the Soviet Union and NATO 's Allied Command Europe , ground based air defence and air defence aircraft have been under integrated command and control . However , while overall air defence may be for homeland defence including military facilities , forces in the field , wherever they are , invariably deploy their own air defence capability if there is an air threat . A surface-based air defence capability can also be deployed offensively to deny the use of airspace to an opponent .
Agricultural diversity can also be divided by whether it is ‘planned’ diversity or ‘associated’ diversity . This is a functional classification that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity . Planned diversity includes the crops which a farmer has encouraged , planted or raised ( e.g . : crops , covers , symbionts and livestock , among others ) , which can be contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the crops , uninvited ( e.g . : herbivores , weed species and pathogens , among others ) .
The concept of a gene continues to be refined as new phenomena are discovered . For example , regulatory regions of a gene can be far removed from its coding regions , and coding regions can be split into several exons . Some viruses store their genome in RNA instead of DNA and some gene products are functional non-coding RNAs . Therefore , a broad , modern working definition of a gene is any discrete locus of heritable , genomic sequence which affect an organism 's traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression .
According to the Namibia Labour Force Survey Report 2012 , conducted by the Namibia Statistics Agency , the country 's unemployment rate is 27.4 % . " Strict unemployment " ( people actively seeking a full-time job ) stood at 20.2 % in 2000 , 21.9 % in 2004 and spiraled to 29.4 % in 2008 . Under a broader definition ( including people that have given up searching for employment ) unemployment rose to 36.7 % in 2004 . This estimate considers people in the informal economy as employed . Labour and Social Welfare Minister Immanuel Ngatjizeko praised the 2008 study as " by far superior in scope and quality to any that has been available previously " , but its methodology has also received criticism .
The Taira and the Minamoto clashed again in 1180 , beginning the Gempei War , which ended in 1185 . Samurai fought at the naval battle of Dan-no-ura , at the Shimonoseki Strait which separates Honshu and Kyushu in 1185 . The victorious Minamoto no Yoritomo established the superiority of the samurai over the aristocracy . In 1190 he visited Kyoto and in 1192 became Sei'i-taishōgun , establishing the Kamakura Shogunate , or Kamakura Bakufu . Instead of ruling from Kyoto , he set up the Shogunate in Kamakura , near his base of power . " Bakufu " means " tent government " , taken from the encampments the soldiers would live in , in accordance with the Bakufu 's status as a military government .
Maas comments further that " A dictation revised by the author must be regarded as equivalent to an autograph manuscript " . The lack of autograph manuscripts applies to many cultures other than Greek and Roman . In such a situation , a key objective becomes the identification of the first exemplar before any split in the tradition . That exemplar is known as the archetype . " If we succeed in establishing the text of [ the archetype ] , the constitutio ( reconstruction of the original ) is considerably advanced .
John Dewey ( 1859–1952 ) modified James ' pragmatism to form a theory known as instrumentalism . The role of sense experience in Dewey 's theory is crucial , in that he saw experience as unified totality of things through which everything else is interrelated . Dewey 's basic thought , in accordance with empiricism was that reality is determined by past experience . Therefore , humans adapt their past experiences of things to perform experiments upon and test the pragmatic values of such experience . The value of such experience is measured experientially and scientifically , and the results of such tests generate ideas that serve as instruments for future experimentation , in physical sciences as in ethics . Thus , ideas in Dewey 's system retain their empiricist flavour in that they are only known a posteriori .
The end for the Laemmles came with a lavish version of Show Boat ( 1936 ) , a remake of its earlier 1929 part-talkie production , and produced as a high-quality , big-budget film rather than as a B-picture . The new film featured several stars from the Broadway stage version , which began production in late 1935 , and unlike the 1929 film was based on the Broadway musical rather than the novel . Carl , Jr. 's spending habits alarmed company stockholders . They would not allow production to start on Show Boat unless the Laemmles obtained a loan . Universal was forced to seek a $ 750,000 production loan from the Standard Capital Corporation , pledging the Laemmle family 's controlling interest in Universal as collateral . It was the first time Universal had borrowed money for a production in its 26-year history . The production went $ 300,000 over budget ; Standard called in the loan , cash-strapped Universal could not pay , Standard foreclosed and seized control of the studio on April 2 , 1936 .
The Berbers along the Barbary Coast ( modern day Libya ) sent pirates to capture merchant ships and hold the crews for ransom . The U.S. paid protection money until 1801 , when President Thomas Jefferson refused to pay and sent in the Navy to challenge the Barbary States , the First Barbary War followed . After the U.S.S . Philadelphia was captured in 1803 , Lieutenant Stephen Decatur led a raid which successfully burned the captured ship , preventing Tripoli from using or selling it . In 1805 , after William Eaton captured the city of Derna , Tripoli agreed to a peace treaty . The other Barbary states continued to raid U.S. shipping , until the Second Barbary War in 1815 ended the practice .
Universal owned the rights to the " Oswald the Lucky Rabbit " character , although Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks had created Oswald , and their films had enjoyed a successful theatrical run . After Charles Mintz had unsuccessfully demanded that Disney accept a lower fee for producing the property , Mintz produced the films with his own group of animators . Instead , Disney and Iwerks created Mickey Mouse who in 1928 stared in the first " sync " sound animated short , Steamboat Willie . This moment effectively launched Walt Disney Studios ' foothold , while Universal became a minor player in film animation . Universal subsequently severed its link to Mintz and formed its own in-house animation studio to produce Oswald cartoons headed by Walter Lantz .
Estimates for the percentage of the population that are bisexual vary widely , at least in part due to differing definitions of bisexuality . Some studies only consider a person bisexual if they are nearly equally attracted to both sexes , and others consider a person bisexual if they are at all attracted to the same sex ( for otherwise mostly heterosexual persons ) or to the opposite sex ( for otherwise mostly homosexual persons ) . A small percentage of people are not sexually attracted to anyone ( asexuality ) . A study in 2004 placed the prevalence of asexuality at 1 % .
At these higher altitudes , the plants tend to form isolated cushions . In the Alps , several species of flowering plants have been recorded above 4,000 m ( 13,120 ft ) , including Ranunculus glacialis , Androsace alpina and Saxifraga biflora . The Eritrichium nanum , commonly known as the King of the Alps , is the most elusive of the alpine flowers , growing on rocky ridges at 2,600 to 3,750 m ( 8,530 to 12,303 ft ) . Perhaps the best known of the alpine plants is the Edelweiss which grows in rocky areas and can be found at altitudes as low as 1,400 m ( 4,593 ft ) and as high as 3,400 m ( 11,155 ft ) . The plants that grow at the highest altitudes have adapted to conditions by specialization such as growing in rock screes that give protection from winds .
The Philippine–American War ( 1899–1902 ) was an armed conflict between a group of Filipino revolutionaries and the American forces following the ceding of the Philippines to the United States after the defeat of Spanish forces in the Battle of Manila . The Army sent in 100,000 soldiers ( mostly from the National Guard ) under General Elwell Otis . Defeated in the field and losing its capital in March 1899 , the poorly armed and poorly led rebels broke into armed bands . The insurgency collapsed in March 1901 when the leader Emilio Aguinaldo was captured by General Frederick Funston and his Macabebe allies . Casualties included 1,037 Americans killed in action and 3,340 who died from disease ; 20,000 rebels were killed .
Notably , a statute does not disappear automatically merely because it has been found unconstitutional ; it must be deleted by a subsequent statute . Many federal and state statutes have remained on the books for decades after they were ruled to be unconstitutional . However , under the principle of stare decisis , no sensible lower court will enforce an unconstitutional statute , and any court that does so will be reversed by the Supreme Court . Conversely , any court that refuses to enforce a constitutional statute ( where such constitutionality has been expressly established in prior cases ) will risk reversal by the Supreme Court .
Initially , the station 's range was officially a 40 kilometres radius of the Alexandra Palace transmitter—in practice , however , transmissions could be picked up a good deal further away , and on one occasion in 1938 were picked up by engineers at RCA in New York , who were experimenting with a British television set .
On 1 September , Germany invaded Poland from the west . Within the first few days of the invasion , Germany began conducting massacres of Polish and Jewish civilians and POWs . These executions took place in over 30 towns and villages in the first month of German occupation . The Luftwaffe also took part by strafing fleeing civilian refugees on roads and carrying out a bombing campaign . The Soviet Union assisted German air forces by allowing them to use signals broadcast by the Soviet radio station at Minsk allegedly " for urgent aeronautical experiments " .
Between April 1877 and February 1878 , she threatened five times to abdicate while pressuring Disraeli to act against Russia during the Russo-Turkish War , but her threats had no impact on the events or their conclusion with the Congress of Berlin . Disraeli 's expansionist foreign policy , which Victoria endorsed , led to conflicts such as the Anglo-Zulu War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War . " If we are to maintain our position as a first-rate Power " , she wrote , " we must ... be Prepared for attacks and wars , somewhere or other , CONTINUALLY . " Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign , protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers : " It is not in our custom to annexe countries " , she said , " unless we are obliged & forced to do so . " To Victoria 's dismay , Disraeli lost the 1880 general election , and Gladstone returned as prime minister . When Disraeli died the following year , she was blinded by " fast falling tears " , and erected a memorial tablet " placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend , Victoria R.I . "
Detroit remains one of the most racially segregated cities in the United States . From the 1940s to the 1970s a second wave of Blacks moved to Detroit to escape Jim Crow laws in the south and find jobs . However , they soon found themselves excluded from white areas of the city—through violence , laws , and economic discrimination ( e.g. , redlining ) . White residents attacked black homes : breaking windows , starting fires , and exploding bombs . The pattern of segregation was later magnified by white migration to the suburbs . One of the implications of racial segregation , which correlates with class segregation , may be overall worse health for some populations .
Clickjacking , also known as " UI redress attack or User Interface redress attack " , is a malicious technique in which an attacker tricks a user into clicking on a button or link on another webpage while the user intended to click on the top level page . This is done using multiple transparent or opaque layers . The attacker is basically " hijacking " the clicks meant for the top level page and routing them to some other irrelevant page , most likely owned by someone else . A similar technique can be used to hijack keystrokes . Carefully drafting a combination of stylesheets , iframes , buttons and text boxes , a user can be led into believing that they are typing the password or other information on some authentic webpage while it is being channeled into an invisible frame controlled by the attacker .
World War II holds a special place in the American psyche as the country 's greatest triumph , and the U.S. military personnel of World War II are frequently referred to as " the Greatest Generation . " Over 16 million served ( about 11 % of the population ) , and over 400,000 died during the war . The U.S. emerged as one of the two undisputed superpowers along with the Soviet Union , and unlike the Soviet Union , the U.S. homeland was virtually untouched by the ravages of war . During and following World War II , the United States and Britain developed an increasingly strong defense and intelligence relationship . Manifestations of this include extensive basing of U.S. forces in the UK , shared intelligence , shared military technology ( e.g . nuclear technology ) , and shared procurement .
The slowing sales growth has been attributed to the maturing PC market , which constituted 66 % of Dell 's sales , and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage , services and servers . Dell 's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs , but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company 's supply chain , and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell , weakening Dell 's traditional price differentiation . Throughout the entire PC industry , declines in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers ( a lucrative strategy of encouraging buyers to upgrade the processor or memory ) . As a result , the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before , which eroded profit margins . The laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the PC market , but Dell produced low-cost notebooks in China like other PC manufacturers which eliminated Dell 's manufacturing cost advantages , plus Dell 's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores . CNET has suggested that Dell was getting trapped in the increasing commoditization of high volume low margin computers , which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded .
The League of American Bicyclists gave Tucson a gold rating for bicycle friendliness in late April 2007 . Tucson hosts the largest perimeter cycling event in the United States . The ride called " El Tour de Tucson " happens in November on the Saturday before Thanksgiving . El Tour de Tucson produced and promoted by Perimeter Bicycling has as many as 10,000 participants from all over the world , annually . Tucson is one of only nine cities in the U.S. to receive a gold rating or higher for cycling friendliness from the League of American Bicyclists . The city is known for its winter cycling opportunities . Both road and mountain biking are popular in and around Tucson with trail areas including Starr Pass and Fantasy Island .
Labour improved its performance in 1987 , gaining 20 seats and so reducing the Conservative majority from 143 to 102 . They were now firmly re-established as the second political party in Britain as the Alliance had once again failed to make a breakthrough with seats . A merger of the SDP and Liberals formed the Liberal Democrats . Following the 1987 election , the National Executive Committee resumed disciplinary action against members of Militant , who remained in the party , leading to further expulsions of their activists and the two MPs who supported the group .
A political party is typically led by a party leader ( the most powerful member and spokesperson representing the party ) , a party secretary ( who maintains the daily work and records of party meetings ) , party treasurer ( who is responsible for membership dues ) and party chair ( who forms strategies for recruiting and retaining party members , and also chairs party meetings ) . Most of the above positions are also members of the party executive , the leading organization which sets policy for the entire party at the national level . The structure is far more decentralized in the United States because of the separation of powers , federalism and the multiplicity of economic interests and religious sects . Even state parties are decentralized as county and other local committees are largely independent of state central committees . The national party leader in the U.S. will be the president , if the party holds that office , or a prominent member of Congress in opposition ( although a big-state governor may aspire to that role ) . Officially , each party has a chairman for its national committee who is a prominent spokesman , organizer and fund-raiser , but without the status of prominent elected office holders .
In March 1912 , in Chihuahua , Gen. Pascual Orozco revolted . Immediately President Francisco Madero commanded Gen. Victoriano Huerta of the Federal Army , to put down the Orozco revolt . The governor of Chihuahua mobilized the state militia led by Colonel Pancho Villa to supplement General Huerta . By June , Villa notified Huerta that the Orozco revolt had been put down and that the militia would consider themselves no longer under Huerta 's command and would depart . Huerta became furious and ordered that Villa be executed . Raúl Madero , Madero 's brother , intervened to save Villa 's life . Jailed in Mexico City , Villa fled to the United States . Madero 's time as leader was short-lived , ended by a coup d'état in 1913 led by Gen. Victoriano Huerta ; Orozco sided with Huerta , and Huerta made him one of his generals .
Geology did not undergo systematic restructuring during the Scientific Revolution , but individual theorists made important contributions . Robert Hooke , for example , formulated a theory of earthquakes , and Nicholas Steno developed the theory of superposition and argued that fossils were the remains of once-living creatures . Beginning with Thomas Burnet 's Sacred Theory of the Earth in 1681 , natural philosophers began to explore the idea that the Earth had changed over time . Burnet and his contemporaries interpreted Earth 's past in terms of events described in the Bible , but their work laid the intellectual foundations for secular interpretations of Earth history .
Buses now provide the majority of local public transport . The main bus operators are First Southampton and Bluestar . Other operators include Brijan Tours , Stagecoach and Xelabus . The other large service provider is the Uni-link bus service ( running from early in the morning to midnight ) , which was commissioned by the University of Southampton to provide transport from the university to the town . Previously run by Enterprise , it is now run by Bluestar . Free buses are provided by City-link ' . The City-link runs from the Red Funnel ferry terminal at Town Quay to Central station via WestQuay and is operated by Bluestar . There is also a door-to-door minibus service called Southampton Dial a Ride , for residents who can not access public transport . This is funded by the council and operated by SCA Support Services .
The Roman Catholic Church canon law also includes the main five rites ( groups ) of churches which are in full union with the Roman Catholic Church and the Supreme Pontiff :
Established bands made something of a comeback in the mid-1980s . After an 8-year separation , Deep Purple returned with the classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers ( 1984 ) , which reached number five in the UK , hit the top five in five other countries , and was a platinum-seller in the US . After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album , Fair Warning , Van Halen rebounded with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982 , then reached their commercial pinnacle with 1984 . It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and provided the track " Jump " , which reached number one on the singles chart and remained there for several weeks . Heart , after floundering during the first half of the decade , made a comeback with their eponymous ninth studio album which hit number one and contained four Top 10 singles including their first number one hit . The new medium of video channels was used with considerable success by bands formed in previous decades . Among the first were ZZ Top , who mixed hard blues rock with new wave music to produce a series of highly successful singles , beginning with " Gim me All Your Lovin ' " ( 1983 ) , which helped their albums Eliminator ( 1983 ) and Afterburner ( 1985 ) achieve diamond and multi-platinum status respectively . Others found renewed success in the singles charts with power ballads , including REO Speedwagon with " Keep on Loving You " ( 1980 ) and " Ca n't Fight This Feeling " ( 1984 ) , Journey with " Do n't Stop Believin ' " ( 1981 ) and " Open Arms " ( 1982 ) , Foreigner 's " I Want to Know What Love Is " , Scorpions ' " Still Loving You " ( both from 1984 ) , Heart’s " What About Love " ( 1985 ) and " These Dreams " ( 1986 ) , and Boston 's " Amanda " ( 1986 ) .
The city council of the city of Bern decided against having twinned cities except for a temporary ( during the UEFA Euro 2008 ) cooperation with the Austrian city Salzburg
The boreholes on Funafuti , at the site now called Darwin 's Drill , are the result of drilling conducted by the Royal Society of London for the purpose of investigating the formation of coral reefs to determine whether traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the coral of Pacific atolls . This investigation followed the work on The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs conducted by Charles Darwin in the Pacific . Drilling occurred in 1896 , 1897 and 1898 . Professor Edgeworth David of the University of Sydney was a member of the 1896 " Funafuti Coral Reef Boring Expedition of the Royal Society " , under Professor William Sollas and lead the expedition in 1897 . Photographers on these trips recorded people , communities , and scenes at Funafuti .
Valencia was founded as a Roman colony in 138 BC . The city is situated on the banks of the Turia , on the east coast of the Iberian Peninsula , fronting the Gulf of Valencia on the Mediterranean Sea . Its historic centre is one of the largest in Spain , with approximately 169 hectares ; this heritage of ancient monuments , views and cultural attractions makes Valencia one of the country 's most popular tourist destinations . Major monuments include Valencia Cathedral , the Torres de Serrans , the Torres de Quart , the Llotja de la Seda ( declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1996 ) , and the Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències ( City of Arts and Sciences ) , an entertainment-based cultural and architectural complex designed by Santiago Calatrava and Félix Candela . The Museu de Belles Arts de València houses a large collection of paintings from the 14th to the 18th centuries , including works by Velázquez , El Greco , and Goya , as well as an important series of engravings by Piranesi . The Institut Valencià d'Art Modern ( Valencian Institute of Modern Art ) houses both permanent collections and temporary exhibitions of contemporary art and photography .
Differences in pain perception and tolerance thresholds are associated with , among other factors , ethnicity , genetics , and sex . People of Mediterranean origin report as painful some radiant heat intensities that northern Europeans describe as nonpainful . And Italian women tolerate less intense electric shock than Jewish or Native American women . Some individuals in all cultures have significantly higher than normal pain perception and tolerance thresholds . For instance , patients who experience painless heart attacks have higher pain thresholds for electric shock , muscle cramp and heat .
Thousands of fonts exist on the market , but fewer than a dozen fonts—sometimes described as " pan-Unicode " fonts—attempt to support the majority of Unicode 's character repertoire . Instead , Unicode-based fonts typically focus on supporting only basic ASCII and particular scripts or sets of characters or symbols . Several reasons justify this approach : applications and documents rarely need to render characters from more than one or two writing systems ; fonts tend to demand resources in computing environments ; and operating systems and applications show increasing intelligence in regard to obtaining glyph information from separate font files as needed , i.e. , font substitution . Furthermore , designing a consistent set of rendering instructions for tens of thousands of glyphs constitutes a monumental task ; such a venture passes the point of diminishing returns for most typefaces .
The Portuguese explorer Diogo Cão reached the mouth of the Congo in 1484 . Commercial relationships quickly grew between the inland Bantu kingdoms and European merchants who traded various commodities , manufactured goods , and people captured from the hinterlands . After centuries as a major hub for transatlantic trade , direct European colonization of the Congo river delta began in the late 19th century , subsequently eroding the power of the Bantu societies in the region .
There are several reasons an otherwise valid and agreed upon treaty may be rejected as a binding international agreement , most of which involve problems created at the formation of the treaty . [ citation needed ] For example , the serial Japan-Korea treaties of 1905 , 1907 and 1910 were protested ; and they were confirmed as " already null and void " in the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea .
Another milestone in the early development of Baptist doctrine was in 1638 with John Spilsbury , a Calvinistic minister who helped to promote the strict practice of believer 's baptism by immersion . According to Tom Nettles , professor of historical theology at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary , " Spilsbury 's cogent arguments for a gathered , disciplined congregation of believers baptized by immersion as constituting the New Testament church gave expression to and built on insights that had emerged within separatism , advanced in the life of John Smyth and the suffering congregation of Thomas Helwys , and matured in Particular Baptists . "
Besides the bit rate of an encoded piece of audio , the quality of MP3 files also depends on the quality of the encoder itself , and the difficulty of the signal being encoded . As the MP3 standard allows quite a bit of freedom with encoding algorithms , different encoders may feature quite different quality , even with identical bit rates . As an example , in a public listening test featuring two different MP3 encoders at about 128 kbit/s , one scored 3.66 on a 1–5 scale , while the other scored only 2.22 .
Detroit 's protracted decline has resulted in severe urban decay and thousands of empty buildings around the city . Some parts of Detroit are so sparsely populated that the city has difficulty providing municipal services . The city has considered various solutions , such as demolishing abandoned homes and buildings ; removing street lighting from large portions of the city ; and encouraging the small population in certain areas to move to more populated locations . While some have estimated 20,000 stray dogs roam the city , studies have shown the true number to be around 1,000-3,000 . Roughly half of the owners of Detroit 's 305,000 properties failed to pay their 2011 tax bills , resulting in about $ 246 million in taxes and fees going uncollected , nearly half of which was due to Detroit ; the rest of the money would have been earmarked for Wayne County , Detroit Public Schools , and the library system .
A knot is a particular type of imperfection in a piece of wood ; it will affect the technical properties of the wood , usually reducing the local strength and increasing the tendency for splitting along the wood grain , but may be exploited for visual effect . In a longitudinally sawn plank , a knot will appear as a roughly circular " solid " ( usually darker ) piece of wood around which the grain of the rest of the wood " flows " ( parts and rejoins ) . Within a knot , the direction of the wood ( grain direction ) is up to 90 degrees different from the grain direction of the regular wood .
In infrared photography , infrared filters are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum . Digital cameras often use infrared blockers . Cheaper digital cameras and camera phones have less effective filters and can " see " intense near-infrared , appearing as a bright purple-white color . This is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near IR-bright areas ( such as near a lamp ) , where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image . There is also a technique called 'T-ray ' imaging , which is imaging using far-infrared or terahertz radiation . Lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques . Recently T-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy .
The Chicago Transit Authority 's elevated train running through Evanston is called the Purple Line , taking its name from Northwestern 's school color . The Foster and Davis stations are within walking distance of the southern end of the campus , while the Noyes station is close to the northern end of the campus . The Central station is close to Ryan Field , Northwestern 's football stadium . The Evanston Davis Street Metra station serves the Northwestern campus in downtown Evanston and the Evanston Central Street Metra station is near Ryan Field . Pace Suburban Bus Service and the CTA have several bus routes that run through or near the Evanston campus .
A major battleground , Burma was devastated during World War II . By March 1942 , within months after they entered the war , Japanese troops had advanced on Rangoon and the British administration had collapsed . A Burmese Executive Administration headed by Ba Maw was established by the Japanese in August 1942 . Wingate 's British Chindits were formed into long-range penetration groups trained to operate deep behind Japanese lines . A similar American unit , Merrill 's Marauders , followed the Chindits into the Burmese jungle in 1943 . Beginning in late 1944 , allied troops launched a series of offensives that led to the end of Japanese rule in July 1945 . The battles were intense with much of Burma laid waste by the fighting . Overall , the Japanese lost some 150,000 men in Burma . Only 1,700 prisoners were taken .
The Crimean War was a military conflict fought between October 1853 – March 1856 in which Russia lost to an alliance of France , the United Kingdom , the Ottoman Empire , and Sardinia . The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land , which was controlled by the Ottoman Empire . The French promoted the rights of Catholics , while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Christians . The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of the United Kingdom and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense . It has widely been noted that the causes , in one case involving an argument over a key , have never revealed a " greater confusion of purpose " , yet led to a war noted for its " notoriously incompetent international butchery . "
Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1970s , the bureau investigated cases of espionage against the United States and its allies . Eight Nazi agents who had planned sabotage operations against American targets were arrested , and six were executed ( Ex parte Quirin ) under their sentences . Also during this time , a joint US/UK code-breaking effort ( the Venona project ) —with which the FBI was heavily involved—broke Soviet diplomatic and intelligence communications codes , allowing the US and British governments to read Soviet communications . This effort confirmed the existence of Americans working in the United States for Soviet intelligence . Hoover was administering this project but failed to notify the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) until 1952 . Another notable case is the arrest of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in 1957 . The discovery of Soviet spies operating in the US allowed Hoover to pursue his longstanding obsession with the threat he perceived from the American Left , ranging from Communist Party of the United States of America ( CPUSA ) union organizers to American liberals .
Prior to 1948 , approximately 800,000 Jews were living in lands which now make up the Arab world ( excluding Israel ) . Of these , just under two-thirds lived in the French-controlled Maghreb region , 15–20 % in the Kingdom of Iraq , approximately 10 % in the Kingdom of Egypt and approximately 7 % in the Kingdom of Yemen . A further 200,000 lived in Pahlavi Iran and the Republic of Turkey . Today , around 26,000 Jews live in Arab countries and around 30,000 in Iran and Turkey . A small-scale exodus had begun in many countries in the early decades of the 20th century , although the only substantial aliyah came from Yemen and Syria . The exodus from Arab and Muslim countries took place primarily from 1948 . The first large-scale exoduses took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s , primarily in Iraq , Yemen and Libya , with up to 90 % of these communities leaving within a few years . The peak of the exodus from Egypt occurred in 1956 . The exodus in the Maghreb countries peaked in the 1960s . Lebanon was the only Arab country to see a temporary increase in its Jewish population during this period , due to an influx of refugees from other Arab countries , although by the mid-1970s the Jewish community of Lebanon had also dwindled . In the aftermath of the exodus wave from Arab states , an additional migration of Iranian Jews peaked in the 1980s when around 80 % of Iranian Jews left the country . [ citation needed ]
Much of the medieval period was a time of power struggles between competing dynasties such as the House of Savoy , the Visconti in northern Italy and the House of Habsburg in Austria and Slovenia . In 1291 to protect themselves from incursions by the Habsburgs , four cantons in the middle of Switzerland drew up a charter that is considered to be a declaration of independence from neighboring kingdoms . After a series of battles fought in the 13th , 14th and 15th centuries , more cantons joined the confederacy and by the 16th century Switzerland was well-established as a separate state .
Nociceptive pain may also be divided into " visceral " , " deep somatic " and " superficial somatic " pain . Visceral structures are highly sensitive to stretch , ischemia and inflammation , but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain in other structures , such as burning and cutting . Visceral pain is diffuse , difficult to locate and often referred to a distant , usually superficial , structure . It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting and may be described as sickening , deep , squeezing , and dull . Deep somatic pain is initiated by stimulation of nociceptors in ligaments , tendons , bones , blood vessels , fasciae and muscles , and is dull , aching , poorly-localized pain . Examples include sprains and broken bones . Superficial pain is initiated by activation of nociceptors in the skin or other superficial tissue , and is sharp , well-defined and clearly located . Examples of injuries that produce superficial somatic pain include minor wounds and minor ( first degree ) burns .
The " formal " interpretation is more widespread than the " substantive " interpretation . Formalists hold that the law must be prospective , well-known , and have characteristics of generality , equality , and certainty . Other than that , the formal view contains no requirements as to the content of the law . This formal approach allows laws that protect democracy and individual rights , but recognizes the existence of " rule of law " in countries that do not necessarily have such laws protecting democracy or individual rights .
At the dawn of the Grand Lodge era , during the 1720s , James Anderson composed the first printed constitutions for Freemasons , the basis for most subsequent constitutions , which specifically excluded women from Freemasonry . As Freemasonry spread , continental masons began to include their ladies in Lodges of Adoption , which worked three degrees with the same names as the men 's but different content . The French officially abandoned the experiment in the early 19th century . Later organisations with a similar aim emerged in the United States , but distinguished the names of the degrees from those of male masonry .
Alternative proposals for the etymology of *Slověninъ propounded by some scholars have much less support . Lozinski argues that the word *slava once had the meaning of worshipper , in this context meaning " practicer of a common Slavic religion , " and from that evolved into an ethnonym . S.B . Bernstein speculates that it derives from a reconstructed Proto-Indo-European * ( s ) lawos , cognate to Ancient Greek λαός laós " population , people , " which itself has no commonly accepted etymology . Meanwhile , others have pointed out that the suffix -enin indicates a man from a certain place , which in this case should be a place called Slova or Slava , possibly a river name . The Old East Slavic Slavuta for the Dnieper River was argued by Henrich Bartek ( 1907–1986 ) to be derived from slova and also the origin of Slovene .
Windows 8 was released to a mixed critical reception . Although reaction towards its performance improvements , security enhancements , and improved support for touchscreen devices was positive , the new user interface of the operating system was widely criticized for being potentially confusing and difficult to learn ( especially when used with a keyboard and mouse instead of a touchscreen ) . Despite these shortcomings , 60 million Windows 8 licenses have been sold through January 2013 , a number which included both upgrades and sales to OEMs for new PCs .
By the Middle Ages , large numbers of Jews lived in the Holy Roman Empire and had assimilated into German culture , including many Jews who had previously assimilated into French culture and had spoken a mixed Judeo-French language . Upon assimilating into German culture , the Jewish German peoples incorporated major parts of the German language and elements of other European languages into a mixed language known as Yiddish . However tolerance and assimilation of Jews in German society suddenly ended during the Crusades with many Jews being forcefully expelled from Germany and Western Yiddish disappeared as a language in Germany over the centuries , with German Jewish people fully adopting the German language .
Portugal has developed a specific culture while being influenced by various civilizations that have crossed the Mediterranean and the European continent , or were introduced when it played an active role during the Age of Discovery . In the 1990s and 2000s ( decade ) , Portugal modernized its public cultural facilities , in addition to the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation established in 1956 in Lisbon . These include the Belém Cultural Centre in Lisbon , Serralves Foundation and the Casa da Música , both in Porto , as well as new public cultural facilities like municipal libraries and concert halls that were built or renovated in many municipalities across the country . Portugal is home to fifteen UNESCO World Heritage Sites , ranking it 8th in Europe and 17th in the world .
Seasonal rankings ( based on average total viewers per episode ) of American Idol . It holds the distinction of having the longest winning streak in the Nielsen annual television ratings ; it became the highest-rated of all television programs in the United States overall for an unprecedented seven consecutive years , or eight consecutive ( and total ) years when either its performance or result show was ranked number one overall .
Spielberg was scheduled to shoot a $ 200 million adaptation of Daniel H. Wilson 's novel Robopocalypse , adapted for the screen by Drew Goddard . The film would follow a global human war against a robot uprising about 15–20 years in the future . Like Lincoln , it was to be released by Disney in the United States and Fox overseas . It was set for release on April 25 , 2014 , with Anne Hathaway and Chris Hemsworth set to star , but Spielberg postponed production indefinitely in January 2013 , just before it had been set to begin .
By May 15 , Premier Wen Jiabao ordered the deployment of an additional 90 helicopters , of which 60 were to be provided by the PLAAF , and 30 were to be provided by the civil aviation industry , bringing the total of number of aircraft deployed in relief operations by the air force , army , and civil aviation to over 150 , resulting in the largest non-combat airlifting operation in People 's Liberation Army history .
In England , one of the few licensed venues The Eclipse attracted people from up and down the country as it was open until the early hours . The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 was a government attempt to ban large rave dance events featuring music with " repetitive beats " . There were a number of abortive " Kill the Bill " demonstrations . The Spiral Tribe at Castle Morten was probably the nail in the coffin for illegal raves , and forced through the bill , which became law , in November 1994 . The music continued to grow and change , as typified by Leftfield with " Release the Pressure " , which introduced dub and reggae into the house sound , although Leftfield had prior releases , such as " Not Forgotten " released in 1990 on Sheffield 's Outer Rhythm records .
ADSL-broadband service is provided with maximum speeds of up to 1536 KBit/s downstream and 512 KBit/s upstream offered on contract levels from lite £16 per month to gold+ at £190 per month . There are a few public WiFi hotspots in Jamestown , which are also being operated by SURE ( formerly Cable & Wireless ) .
Quotient groups and subgroups together form a way of describing every group by its presentation : any group is the quotient of the free group over the generators of the group , quotiented by the subgroup of relations . The dihedral group D4 , for example , can be generated by two elements r and f ( for example , r = r1 , the right rotation and f = fv the vertical ( or any other ) reflection ) , which means that every symmetry of the square is a finite composition of these two symmetries or their inverses . Together with the relations
Cancer is now common in developing countries . According to a study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer , " In the developing world , cancers of the liver , stomach and esophagus were more common , often linked to consumption of carcinogenic preserved foods , such as smoked or salted food , and parasitic infections that attack organs . " Lung cancer rates are rising rapidly in poorer nations because of increased use of tobacco . Developed countries " tended to have cancers linked to affluence or a 'Western lifestyle ' — cancers of the colon , rectum , breast and prostate — that can be caused by obesity , lack of exercise , diet and age . "
Imperial submitted a total of 1,257 staff across 14 units of assessment to the 2014 Research Excellence Framework ( REF ) assessment . In the REF results 46 % of Imperial 's submitted research was classified as 4* , 44 % as 3* , 9 % as 2* and 1 % as 1* , giving an overall GPA of 3.36 . In rankings produced by Times Higher Education based upon the REF results Imperial was ranked 2nd overall for GPA and 8th for " research power " ( compared to 6th and 7th respectively in the equivalent rankings for the RAE 2008 ) .
On 17 March 1883 , she fell down some stairs at Windsor , which left her lame until July ; she never fully recovered and was plagued with rheumatism thereafter . Brown died 10 days after her accident , and to the consternation of her private secretary , Sir Henry Ponsonby , Victoria began work on a eulogistic biography of Brown . Ponsonby and Randall Davidson , Dean of Windsor , who had both seen early drafts , advised Victoria against publication , on the grounds that it would stoke the rumours of a love affair . The manuscript was destroyed . In early 1884 , Victoria did publish More Leaves from a Journal of a Life in the Highlands , a sequel to her earlier book , which she dedicated to her " devoted personal attendant and faithful friend John Brown " . On the day after the first anniversary of Brown 's death , Victoria was informed by telegram that her youngest son , Leopold , had died in Cannes . He was " the dearest of my dear sons " , she lamented . The following month , Victoria 's youngest child , Beatrice , met and fell in love with Prince Henry of Battenberg at the wedding of Victoria 's granddaughter Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine to Henry 's brother Prince Louis of Battenberg . Beatrice and Henry planned to marry , but Victoria opposed the match at first , wishing to keep Beatrice at home to act as her companion . After a year , she was won around to the marriage by Henry and Beatrice 's promise to remain living with and attending her .
However , Mathews ' frustration with Whitehead 's books did not negatively affect his interest . In fact , there were numerous philosophers and theologians at Chicago 's Divinity School that perceived the importance of what Whitehead was doing without fully grasping all of the details and implications . In 1927 they invited one of America 's only Whitehead experts – Henry Nelson Wieman – to Chicago to give a lecture explaining Whitehead 's thought . Wieman 's lecture was so brilliant that he was promptly hired to the faculty and taught there for twenty years , and for at least thirty years afterward Chicago 's Divinity School was closely associated with Whitehead 's thought .
The cardinal deacons are the lowest-ranking cardinals . Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are either officials of the Roman Curia or priests elevated after their 80th birthday . Bishops with diocesan responsibilities , however , are created cardinal priests .
human activities are more likely to affect the habitat in areas of permanent water ( oases ) or where water comes close to the surface . Here , the local pressure on natural resources can be intense . The remaining populations of large mammals have been greatly reduced by hunting for food and recreation . In recent years development projects have started in the deserts of Algeria and Tunisia using irrigated water pumped from underground aquifers . These schemes often lead to soil degradation and salinization .
The oldest evidence of burial customs in the Horn of Africa comes from cemeteries in Somalia dating back to 4th millennium BC . The stone implements from the Jalelo site in northern Somalia are said to be the most important link in evidence of the universality in palaeolithic times between the East and the West .
Anthropologists maintain that hunter/gatherers do n't have permanent leaders ; instead , the person taking the initiative at any one time depends on the task being performed . In addition to social and economic equality in hunter-gatherer societies , there is often , though not always , sexual parity as well . Hunter-gatherers are often grouped together based on kinship and band ( or tribe ) membership . Postmarital residence among hunter-gatherers tends to be matrilocal , at least initially . Young mothers can enjoy childcare support from their own mothers , who continue living nearby in the same camp . The systems of kinship and descent among human hunter-gatherers were relatively flexible , although there is evidence that early human kinship in general tended to be matrilineal .
The creation of the public sphere has been associated with two long-term historical trends : the rise of the modern nation state and the rise of capitalism . The modern nation state , in its consolidation of public power , created by counterpoint a private realm of society independent of the state , which allowed for the public sphere . Capitalism also increased society 's autonomy and self-awareness , and an increasing need for the exchange of information . As the nascent public sphere expanded , it embraced a large variety of institutions ; the most commonly cited were coffee houses and cafés , salons and the literary public sphere , figuratively localized in the Republic of Letters . In France , the creation of the public sphere was helped by the aristocracy 's move from the King 's palace at Versailles to Paris in about 1720 , since their rich spending stimulated the trade in luxuries and artistic creations , especially fine paintings .
The creation of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 was through the unification of the western states ( which were previously under American , British , and French administration ) created in the aftermath of World War II . Initially , in 1949 , the states of the Federal Republic were Baden , Bavaria ( in German : Bayern ) , Bremen , Hamburg , Hesse ( Hessen ) , Lower Saxony ( Niedersachsen ) , North Rhine Westphalia ( Nordrhein-Westfalen ) , Rhineland-Palatinate ( Rheinland-Pfalz ) , Schleswig-Holstein , Württemberg-Baden , and Württemberg-Hohenzollern . West Berlin , while officially not part of the Federal Republic , was largely integrated and considered as a de facto state .
A thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives , including psychology , biology , history , sociology , education , and anthropology . Within all of these perspectives , adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood , whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles . It is a period of multiple transitions involving education , training , employment and unemployment , as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another .
Interspersed repeats mainly come from transposable elements ( TEs ) , but they also include some protein coding gene families and pseudogenes . Transposable elements are able to integrate into the genome at another site within the cell . It is believed that TEs are an important driving force on genome evolution of higher eukaryotes . TEs can be classified into two categories , Class 1 ( retrotransposons ) and Class 2 ( DNA transposons ) .
The first mention of the name " Rajasthan " appears in James Tod 's 1829 publication Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han or the Central and Western Rajpoot States of India , while the earliest known record of " Rajputana " as a name for the region is in George Thomas 's 1800 memoir Military Memories . John Keay , in his book India : A History , stated that " Rajputana " was coined by the British in 1829 , John Briggs , translating Ferishta 's history of early Islamic India , used the phrase " Rajpoot ( Rajput ) princes " rather than " Indian princes " .
On 15 July 1974 , the Greek military junta under Dimitrios Ioannides carried out a coup d'état in Cyprus , to unite the island with Greece . The coup ousted president Makarios III and replaced him with pro-enosis nationalist Nikos Sampson . In response to the coup , five days later , on 20 July 1974 , the Turkish army invaded the island , citing a right to intervene to restore the constitutional order from the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee . This justification has been rejected by the United Nations and the international community .
Since 2009 , the Tucson Festival of Books has been held annually over a two-day period in March at the University of Arizona . By 2010 it had become the fourth largest book festival in the United States , with 450 authors and 80,000 attendees . In addition to readings and lectures , it features a science fair , varied entertainment , food , and exhibitors ranging from local retailers and publishers to regional and national nonprofit organizations . In 2011 , the Festival began presenting a Founder 's Award ; recipients include Elmore Leonard and R.L . Stine .
On the eve of America 's entry into World War II , CAA began to extend its ATC responsibilities to takeoff and landing operations at airports . This expanded role eventually became permanent after the war . The application of radar to ATC helped controllers in their drive to keep abreast of the postwar boom in commercial air transportation . In 1946 , meanwhile , Congress gave CAA the added task of administering the federal-aid airport program , the first peacetime program of financial assistance aimed exclusively at promoting development of the nation 's civil airports .
Gorbachev again refused to make any changes to the status of Nagorno Karabakh , which remained part of Azerbaijan . Instead he sacked both Republics ' Communist Party Leaders : On May 21 , 1988 , Karen Demirchian was replaced by Suren Harutyunyan as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia . However , Harutyunyan quickly decided to run before the nationalist wind and on May 28 , allowed Armenians to unfurl the red-blue-gold First Armenian Republic flag for the first time in almost 70 years . On June 15 , 1988 , the Armenian Supreme Soviet adopted a resolution formally approving the idea of Nagorno Karabakh joining Armenia . Armenia , formerly one of the most loyal Republics , had suddenly turned into the leading rebel republic . On July 5 , 1988 , when a contingent of troops was sent in to remove demonstrators by force from Yerevan 's Zvartnots International Airport , shots were fired and one student protester was killed . In September , further large demonstrations in Yerevan led to the deployment of armored vehicles . In the autumn of 1988 almost all the 200,000 Azerbaijani minority in Armenia was expelled by Armenian Nationalists , with over 100 killed in the process – this , after the Sumgait pogrom earlier that year carried out by Azerbaijanis against ethnic Armenians and subsequent expulsion of all Armenians from Azerbaijan . On November 25 , 1988 , a military commandant took control of Yerevan as the Soviet government moved to prevent further ethnic violence .
According to a tradition first reported by Sulcard in about 1080 , a church was founded at the site ( then known as Thorn Ey ( Thorn Island ) ) in the 7th century , at the time of Mellitus , a Bishop of London . Construction of the present church began in 1245 , on the orders of King Henry III .
Writing in 1998 Kurt Jonassohn and Karin Björnson stated that the CPPCG was a legal instrument resulting from a diplomatic compromise . As such the wording of the treaty is not intended to be a definition suitable as a research tool , and although it is used for this purpose , as it has an international legal credibility that others lack , other definitions have also been postulated . Jonassohn and Björnson go on to say that none of these alternative definitions have gained widespread support for various reasons .
Oklahoma holds eleven public regional universities , including Northeastern State University , the second-oldest institution of higher education west of the Mississippi River , also containing the only College of Optometry in Oklahoma and the largest enrollment of Native American students in the nation by percentage and amount . Langston University is Oklahoma 's only historically black college . Six of the state 's universities were placed in the Princeton Review 's list of best 122 regional colleges in 2007 , and three made the list of top colleges for best value . The state has 55 post-secondary technical institutions operated by Oklahoma 's CareerTech program for training in specific fields of industry or trade .
At Buya in Eritrea , one of the oldest hominids representing a possible link between Homo erectus and an archaic Homo sapiens was found by Italian scientists . Dated to over 1 million years old , it is the oldest skeletal find of its kind and provides a link between hominids and the earliest anatomically modern humans . It is believed that the section of the Danakil Depression in Eritrea was also a major player in terms of human evolution , and may contain other traces of evolution from Homo erectus hominids to anatomically modern humans .
Other cities with a concentration of secular Gothic include Bruges and Siena . Most surviving small secular buildings are relatively plain and straightforward ; most windows are flat-topped with mullions , with pointed arches and vaulted ceilings often only found at a few focal points . The country-houses of the nobility were slow to abandon the appearance of being a castle , even in parts of Europe , like England , where defence had ceased to be a real concern . The living and working parts of many monastic buildings survive , for example at Mont Saint-Michel .
The black-body problem was revisited in 1905 , when Rayleigh and Jeans ( on the one hand ) and Einstein ( on the other hand ) independently proved that classical electromagnetism could never account for the observed spectrum . These proofs are commonly known as the " ultraviolet catastrophe " , a name coined by Paul Ehrenfest in 1911 . They contributed greatly ( along with Einstein 's work on the photoelectric effect ) to convincing physicists that Planck 's postulate of quantized energy levels was more than a mere mathematical formalism . The very first Solvay Conference in 1911 was devoted to " the theory of radiation and quanta " . Max Planck received the 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics " in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta " .
In 1943 , at the age of 16 , Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the Grenadier Guards , of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year . As she approached her 18th birthday , parliament changed the law so that she could act as one of five Counsellors of State in the event of her father 's incapacity or absence abroad , such as his visit to Italy in July 1944 . In February 1945 , she joined the Women 's Auxiliary Territorial Service as an honorary second subaltern with the service number of 230873 . She trained as a driver and mechanic and was promoted to honorary junior commander five months later .
Victoria 's father was Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn , the fourth son of the reigning King of the United Kingdom , George III . Until 1817 , Edward 's niece , Princess Charlotte of Wales , was the only legitimate grandchild of George III . Her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children . In 1818 he married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld , a widowed German princess with two children—Carl ( 1804–1856 ) and Feodora ( 1807–1872 ) —by her first marriage to the Prince of Leiningen . Her brother Leopold was Princess Charlotte 's widower . The Duke and Duchess of Kent 's only child , Victoria , was born at 4.15 a.m. on 24 May 1819 at Kensington Palace in London .
According to Walter Gratzer , the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century BC . In China , the concept of Qi developed , a spirit or " wind " similar to what Western Europeans later called pneuma . Food was classified into " hot " ( for example , meats , blood , ginger , and hot spices ) and " cold " ( green vegetables ) in China , India , Malaya , and Persia . Humours developed perhaps first in China alongside qi . Ho the Physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements ( Wu Xing : fire , water , earth , wood , and metal ) , and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets . About the same time in Italy , Alcmaeon of Croton ( a Greek ) wrote of the importance of equilibrium between what goes in and what goes out , and warned that imbalance would result disease marked by obesity or emaciation .
During the administration of U.S. President Martin Van Buren , nearly 17,000 Cherokees—along with approximately 2,000 black slaves owned by Cherokees—were uprooted from their homes between 1838 and 1839 and were forced by the U.S. military to march from " emigration depots " in Eastern Tennessee ( such as Fort Cass ) toward the more distant Indian Territory west of Arkansas . During this relocation an estimated 4,000 Cherokees died along the way west . In the Cherokee language , the event is called Nunna daul Isunyi— " the Trail Where We Cried . " The Cherokees were not the only American Indians forced to emigrate as a result of the Indian removal efforts of the United States , and so the phrase " Trail of Tears " is sometimes used to refer to similar events endured by other American Indian peoples , especially among the " Five Civilized Tribes " . The phrase originated as a description of the earlier emigration of the Choctaw nation .
Parasitoids are organisms living in or on their host and feeding directly upon it , eventually leading to its death . They are much like parasites in their close symbiotic relationship with their host or hosts . Like the previous two classifications parasitoid predators do not kill their hosts instantly . However , unlike parasites , they are very similar to true predators in that the fate of their prey is quite inevitably death . A well-known example of a parasitoids are the ichneumon wasps , solitary insects living a free life as an adult , then laying eggs on or in another species such as a caterpillar . Its larva ( e ) feed on the growing host causing it little harm at first , but soon devouring the internal organs until finally destroying the nervous system resulting in prey death . By this stage the young wasp ( s ) are developed sufficiently to move to the next stage in their life cycle . Though limited mainly to the insect order Hymenoptera , Diptera and Coleoptera parasitoids make up as much as 10 % of all insect species .
In 77 BC , the senate sent one of Sulla 's former lieutenants , Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ( " Pompey the Great " ) , to put down an uprising in Spain . By 71 BC , Pompey returned to Rome after having completed his mission . Around the same time , another of Sulla 's former lieutenants , Marcus Licinius Crassus , had just put down the Spartacus-led gladiator/slave revolt in Italy . Upon their return , Pompey and Crassus found the populares party fiercely attacking Sulla 's constitution . They attempted to forge an agreement with the populares party . If both Pompey and Crassus were elected consul in 70 BC , they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of Sulla 's constitution . The two were soon elected , and quickly dismantled most of Sulla 's constitution .
After Richard 's death on 6 April 1199 there were two potential claimants to the Angevin throne : John , whose claim rested on being the sole surviving son of Henry II , and young Arthur I of Brittany , who held a claim as the son of John 's elder brother Geoffrey . Richard appears to have started to recognise John as his heir presumptive in the final years before his death , but the matter was not clear-cut and medieval law gave little guidance as to how the competing claims should be decided . With Norman law favouring John as the only surviving son of Henry II and Angevin law favouring Arthur as the only son of Henry 's elder son , the matter rapidly became an open conflict . John was supported by the bulk of the English and Norman nobility and was crowned at Westminster , backed by his mother , Eleanor . Arthur was supported by the majority of the Breton , Maine and Anjou nobles and received the support of Philip II , who remained committed to breaking up the Angevin territories on the continent . With Arthur 's army pressing up the Loire valley towards Angers and Philip 's forces moving down the valley towards Tours , John 's continental empire was in danger of being cut in two .
Students attending BYU are required to follow an honor code , which mandates behavior in line with LDS teachings such as academic honesty , adherence to dress and grooming standards , and abstinence from extramarital sex and from the consumption of drugs and alcohol . Many students ( 88 percent of men , 33 percent of women ) either delay enrollment or take a hiatus from their studies to serve as Mormon missionaries . ( Men typically serve for two-years , while women serve for 18 months . ) An education at BYU is also less expensive than at similar private universities , since " a significant portion " of the cost of operating the university is subsidized by the church 's tithing funds .
However , Lok-Ham Chan , a professor of history at the University of Washington , writes that Changchub Gyaltsen 's aims were to recreate the old Tibetan Kingdom that existed during the Chinese Tang dynasty , to build " nationalist sentiment " amongst Tibetans , and to " remove all traces of Mongol suzerainty . " Georges Dreyfus , a professor of religion at Williams College , writes that it was Changchub Gyaltsen who adopted the old administrative system of Songtsän Gampo ( c. 605–649 ) —the first leader of the Tibetan Empire to establish Tibet as a strong power—by reinstating its legal code of punishments and administrative units . For example , instead of the 13 governorships established by the Mongol Sakya viceroy , Changchub Gyaltsen divided Central Tibet into districts ( dzong ) with district heads ( dzong dpon ) who had to conform to old rituals and wear clothing styles of old Imperial Tibet . Van Praag asserts that Changchub Gyaltsen 's ambitions were to " restore to Tibet the glories of its Imperial Age " by reinstating secular administration , promoting " national culture and traditions , " and installing a law code that survived into the 20th century .
A Macau resident was arrested on April 26 for posting a message on cyberctm.com encouraging people to disrupt the relay . Both orchidbbs.com and cyberctm.com Internet forums were shut down from May 2 to 4 . This fueled speculation that the shutdowns were targeting speeches against the relay . The head of the Bureau of Telecommunications Regulation has denied that the shutdowns of the websites were politically motivated . About 2,200 police were deployed on the streets , there were no interruptions .
On August 19 , 1989 , the Russian Orthodox Parish of Saints Peter and Paul announced it would be switching to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church . On September 2 , 1989 , tens of thousands across Ukraine protested a draft election law that reserved special seats for the Communist Party and for other official organizations : 50,000 in Lviv , 40,000 in Kiev , 10,000 in Zhytomyr , 5,000 each in Dniprodzerzhynsk and Chervonohrad , and 2,000 in Kharkiv . From September 8–10 , 1989 , writer Ivan Drach was elected to head Rukh , the People 's Movement of Ukraine , at its founding congress in Kiev . On September 17 , between 150,000 and 200,000 people marched in Lviv , demanding the legalization of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church . On September 21 , 1989 , exhumation of a mass grave begins in Demianiv Laz , a nature preserve south of Ivano-Frankivsk . On September 28 , First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Ukraine Volodymyr Shcherbytsky , a holdover from the Brezhnev era , was replaced by Vladimir Ivashko .
In March 2003 the BBC announced that from the end of May 2003 ( subsequently deferred to 14 July ) it intended to transmit all eight of its domestic television channels ( including the 15 regional variations of BBC 1 ) unencrypted from the Astra 2D satellite . This move was estimated to save the BBC £85 million over the next five years .
Paris is home to the association football club Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade Français . The 80,000-seat Stade de France , built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup , is located just north of Paris in the commune of Saint-Denis . Paris hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros . Paris played host to the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics , the 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups , and the 2007 Rugby World Cup . Every July , the Tour de France of cycling finishes in the city .
Scotland , meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom . In 1603 , that changed when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England , and consequently the Crown of Ireland also . The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval , religious division and war . English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster . Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament . A prime issue was , inter alia , over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism . The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England . Ireland , largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king . Following defeat to the parliaments army , large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English ( Hiberno-Norman ) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland . The new ruling class was Protestant and British , whilst the common people were largely Catholic and Irish . This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come . When the monarchy was restored in England , the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland . The " Glorious Revolution " of 1688 repeated similar themes : a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England . The king 's army was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial Battle of Aughrim in Ireland . Resistance held out , and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the Treaty of Limerick . However , in the evolving political climate , the terms of Limerick were superseded , a new monarchy was installed , and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws , which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics .
Houston ( i/ˈhjuːstən/ HYOO-stən ) is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth most populous city in the United States , located in Southeast Texas near the Gulf of Mexico . With a census-estimated 2014 population of 2.239 million people , within a land area of 599.6 square miles ( 1,553 km2 ) , it also is the largest city in the Southern United States , as well as the seat of Harris County . It is the principal city of Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land , which is the fifth most populated metropolitan area in the United States .
Muammar Gaddafi was born in a tent near Qasr Abu Hadi , a rural area outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of western Libya . His family came from a small , relatively un-influential tribal group called the Qadhadhfa , who were Arabized Berber in heritage . His father , Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad , was known as Abu Meniar ( died 1985 ) , and his mother was named Aisha ( died 1978 ) ; Abu Meniar earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder . Nomadic Bedouins , they were illiterate and kept no birth records . As such , Gaddafi 's date of birth is not known with certainty , and sources have set it in 1942 or in the spring of 1943 , although biographers Blundy and Lycett noted that it could have been pre-1940 . His parents ' only surviving son , he had three older sisters . Gaddafi 's upbringing in Bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life . He repeatedly expressed a preference for the desert over the city and retreated to the desert to meditate .
Other platings used are OSP ( organic surface protectant ) , immersion silver ( IAg ) , immersion tin , electroless nickel with immersion gold coating ( ENIG ) , electroless nickel electroless palladium immersion gold ( ENEPIG ) and direct gold plating ( over nickel ) . Edge connectors , placed along one edge of some boards , are often nickel plated then gold plated . Another coating consideration is rapid diffusion of coating metal into Tin solder . Tin forms intermetallics such as Cu5Sn6 and Ag3Cu that dissolve into the Tin liquidus or solidus ( @ 50C ) , stripping surface coating or leaving voids .
18th century governors tried to tackle the island 's problems by implementing tree plantation , improving fortifications , eliminating corruption , building a hospital , tackling the neglect of crops and livestock , controlling the consumption of alcohol and introducing legal reforms . From about 1770 , the island enjoyed a lengthy period of prosperity . Captain James Cook visited the island in 1775 on the final leg of his second circumnavigation of the world . St. James ' Church was erected in Jamestown in 1774 and in 1791–92 Plantation House was built , and has since been the official residence of the Governor .
Soon Lutyens started considering other places . Indeed , the Delhi Town Planning Committee , set up to plan the new imperial capital , with George Swinton as chairman and John A. Brodie and Lutyens as members , submitted reports for both North and South sites . However , it was rejected by the Viceroy when the cost of acquiring the necessary properties was found to be too high . The central axis of New Delhi , which today faces east at India Gate , was previously meant to be a north-south axis linking the Viceroy 's House at one end with Paharganj at the other . During the project 's early years , many tourists believed it was a gate from Earth to Heaven itself . Eventually , owing to space constraints and the presence of a large number of heritage sites in the North side , the committee settled on the South site . A site atop the Raisina Hill , formerly Raisina Village , a Meo village , was chosen for the Rashtrapati Bhawan , then known as the Viceroy 's House . The reason for this choice was that the hill lay directly opposite the Dinapanah citadel , which was also considered the site of Indraprastha , the ancient region of Delhi . Subsequently , the foundation stone was shifted from the site of Delhi Durbar of 1911–1912 , where the Coronation Pillar stood , and embedded in the walls of the forecourt of the Secretariat . The Rajpath , also known as King 's Way , stretched from the India Gate to the Rashtrapati Bhawan . The Secretariat building , the two blocks of which flank the Rashtrapati Bhawan and houses ministries of the Government of India , and the Parliament House , both designed by Herbert Baker , are located at the Sansad Marg and run parallel to the Rajpath .
In the early 20th century Valencia was an industrialised city . The silk industry had disappeared , but there was a large production of hides and skins , wood , metals and foodstuffs , this last with substantial exports , particularly of wine and citrus . Small businesses predominated , but with the rapid mechanisation of industry larger companies were being formed . The best expression of this dynamic was in the regional exhibitions , including that of 1909 held next to the pedestrian avenue L'Albereda ( Paseo de la Alameda ) , which depicted the progress of agriculture and industry . Among the most architecturally successful buildings of the era were those designed in the Art Nouveau style , such as the North Station ( Gare du Nord ) and the Central and Columbus markets .
In September 1940 , during the Second World War , pro-Gaullist French officers took control of Ubangi-Shari and General Leclerc established his headquarters for the Free French Forces in Bangui . In 1946 Barthélémy Boganda was elected with 9,000 votes to the French National Assembly , becoming the first representative for CAR in the French government . Boganda maintained a political stance against racism and the colonial regime but gradually became disheartened with the French political system and returned to CAR to establish the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa ( MESAN ) in 1950 .
Bushi was the name given to the ancient Japanese soldiers from traditional warrior families . The bushi class was developed mainly in the north of Japan . They formed powerful clans , which in the 12th century were against the noble families who were grouping themselves to support the imperial family who lived in Kyoto . Samurai was a word used by the Kuge aristocratic class with warriors themselves preferring the word bushi . The term Bushidō , the " way of the warrior " , is derived from this term and the mansion of a warrior was called bukeyashiki .
It is possible that around 62 million people died in the war ; estimates vary greatly . About 60 % of all casualties were civilians , who died as a result of disease , starvation , genocide ( in particular , the Holocaust ) , and aerial bombing . The former Soviet Union and China suffered the most casualties . Estimates place deaths in the Soviet Union at around 23 million , while China suffered about 10 million . No country lost a greater portion of its population than Poland : approximately 5.6 million , or 16 % , of its pre-war population of 34.8 million died .
For many years Arsenal 's away colours were white shirts and either black or white shorts . In the 1969–70 season , Arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts . This kit was worn in the 1971 FA Cup Final as Arsenal beat Liverpool to secure the double for the first time in their history . Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again the following year wearing the red and white home strip and were beaten by Leeds United . Arsenal then competed in three consecutive FA Cup finals between 1978 and 1980 wearing their " lucky " yellow and blue strip , which remained the club 's away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in 1982–83 . The following season , Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme , albeit with a darker shade of blue than before .
The adolescent growth spurt is a rapid increase in the individual 's height and weight during puberty resulting from the simultaneous release of growth hormones , thyroid hormones , and androgens . Males experience their growth spurt about two years later , on average , than females . During their peak height velocity ( the time of most rapid growth ) , adolescents grow at a growth rate nearly identical to that of a toddler—about 4 inches ( 10.3 cm ) a year for males and 3.5 inches ( 9 cm ) for females . In addition to changes in height , adolescents also experience a significant increase in weight ( Marshall , 1978 ) . The weight gained during adolescence constitutes nearly half of one 's adult body weight . Teenage and early adult males may continue to gain natural muscle growth even after puberty .
Birds have wings which are more or less developed depending on the species ; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moas and elephant birds . Wings , which evolved from forelimbs , give most birds the ability to fly , although further speciation has led to some flightless birds , including ratites , penguins , and diverse endemic island species of birds . The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight . Some bird species of aquatic environments , particularly the aforementioned flightless penguins , and also members of the duck family , have also evolved for swimming . Birds , specifically Darwin 's finches , played an important part in the inception of Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection .
From 1898 , it was commonly accepted that the name was of Celtic origin and meant place belonging to a man called *Londinos ; this explanation has since been rejected . Richard Coates put forward an explanation in 1998 that it is derived from the pre-Celtic Old European * ( p ) lowonida , meaning 'river too wide to ford ' , and suggested that this was a name given to the part of the River Thames which flows through London ; from this , the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name , *Lowonidonjon ; this requires quite a serious amendment however . The ultimate difficulty lies in reconciling the Latin form Londinium with the modern Welsh Llundain , which should demand a form * ( h ) lōndinion ( as opposed to *londīnion ) , from earlier *loundiniom . The possibility can not be ruled out that the Welsh name was borrowed back in from English at a later date , and thus can not be used as a basis from which to reconstruct the original name .
The town of Stalybridge in Cheshire is thought to have the pubs with both the longest and shortest names in the United Kingdom — The Old 13th Cheshire Rifleman Corps Inn and the Q Inn .
The Times faced financial extinction in 1890 under Arthur Fraser Walter , but it was rescued by an energetic editor , Charles Frederic Moberly Bell . During his tenure ( 1890–1911 ) , The Times became associated with selling the Encyclopædia Britannica using aggressive American marketing methods introduced by Horace Everett Hooper and his advertising executive , Henry Haxton . Due to legal fights between the Britannica 's two owners , Hooper and Walter Montgomery Jackson , The Times severed its connection in 1908 and was bought by pioneering newspaper magnate , Alfred Harmsworth , later Lord Northcliffe .
In Fall 2008 , Northwestern opened a campus in Education City , Doha , Qatar , joining five other American universities : Carnegie Mellon University , Cornell University , Georgetown University , Texas A & M University , and Virginia Commonwealth University . Through the Medill School of Journalism and School of Communication , NU-Q offers bachelor 's degrees in journalism and communication respectively . The Qatar Foundation for Education , Science and Community Development provided funding for construction and administrative costs as well as support to hire 50 to 60 faculty and staff , some of whom rotate between the Evanston and Qatar campuses . In February 2016 , Northwestern reached an agreement with the Qatar Foundation to extend the operations of the NU-Q branch for an additional decade , through the 2027-2028 academic year .
The first British patent for the use of asphalt/bitumen was 'Cassell 's patent asphalte or bitumen ' in 1834 . Then on 25 November 1837 , Richard Tappin Claridge patented the use of Seyssel asphalt ( patent # 7849 ) , for use in asphalte pavement , having seen it employed in France and Belgium when visiting with Frederick Walter Simms , who worked with him on the introduction of asphalt to Britain . Dr T. Lamb Phipson writes that his father , Samuel Ryland Phipson , a friend of Claridge , was also " instrumental in introducing the asphalte pavement ( in 1836 ) " . Indeed , mastic pavements had been previously employed at Vauxhall by a competitor of Claridge , but without success .
Following a headlining set at Coachella 2011 that was described by The Hollywood Reporter as " one of greatest hip-hop sets of all time " , West released the collaborative album Watch the Throne with Jay-Z . By employing a sales strategy that released the album digitally weeks before its physical counterpart , Watch the Throne became one of the few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak . " Niggas in Paris " became the record 's highest charting single , peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 . In 2012 , West released the compilation album Cruel Summer , a collection of tracks by artists from West 's record label GOOD Music . Cruel Summer produced four singles , two of which charted within the top twenty of the Hot 100 : " Mercy " and " Clique " . West also directed a film of the same name that premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival in custom pyramid-shaped screening pavilion featuring seven screens .
The Richmond area also has two railroad stations served by Amtrak . Each station receives regular service from north of Richmond including Washington , D.C. , Philadelphia , and New York . The suburban Staples Mill Road Station is located on a major north-south freight line and receives all service to and from all points south including , Raleigh , Durham , Savannah , Newport News , Williamsburg and Florida . Richmond 's only railway station located within the city limits , the historic Main Street Station , was renovated in 2004 . As of 2010 , the station only receives trains headed to and from Newport News and Williamsburg due to track layout . As a result , the Staples Mill Road station receives more trains and serves more passengers overall .
Voting results have been a consistent source of controversy . The mechanism of voting had also aroused considerable criticisms , most notably in season two when Ruben Studdard beat Clay Aiken in a close vote , and in season eight , when the massive increase in text votes ( 100 million more text votes than season 7 ) fueled the texting controversy . Concerns about power voting have been expressed from the very first season . Since 2004 , votes also have been affected to a limited degree by online communities such as DialIdol , Vote for the Worst ( closed in 2013 ) , and Vote for the Girls ( started 2010 ) .
ISPs may engage in peering , where multiple ISPs interconnect at peering points or Internet exchange points ( IXs ) , allowing routing of data between each network , without charging one another for the data transmitted—data that would otherwise have passed through a third upstream ISP , incurring charges from the upstream ISP .
The India Gate built in 1931 was inspired by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris . It is the national monument of India commemorating the 90,000 soldiers of the Indian Army who lost their lives while fighting for the British Raj in World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War .
Heartwood is often visually distinct from the living sapwood , and can be distinguished in a cross-section where the boundary will tend to follow the growth rings . For example , it is sometimes much darker . However , other processes such as decay or insect invasion can also discolor wood , even in woody plants that do not form heartwood , which may lead to confusion .
Only Umayyad ruler ( Caliphs of Damascus ) , Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz , is unanimously praised by Sunni sources for his devout piety and justice . In his efforts to spread Islam he established liberties for the Mawali by abolishing the jizya tax for converts to Islam . Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam stated that Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz also stopped the personal allowance offered to his relatives stating that he could only give them an allowance if he gave an allowance to everyone else in the empire . Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz was later poisoned in the year 720 . When successive governments tried to reverse Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz 's tax policies it created rebellion .
With an educational system made up of public school districts and independent private institutions , Oklahoma had 638,817 students enrolled in 1,845 public primary , secondary , and vocational schools in 533 school districts as of 2008 [ update ] . Oklahoma has the highest enrollment of Native American students in the nation with 126,078 students in the 2009-10 school year . Ranked near the bottom of states in expenditures per student , Oklahoma spent $ 7,755 for each student in 2008 , 47th in the nation , though its growth of total education expenditures between 1992 and 2002 ranked 22nd .
In England , Presbyterianism was established in secret in 1592 . Thomas Cartwright is thought to be the first Presbyterian in England . Cartwright 's controversial lectures at Cambridge University condemning the episcopal hierarchy of the Elizabethan Church led to his deprivation of his post by Archbishop John Whitgift and his emigration abroad . Between 1645 and 1648 , a series of ordinances of the Long Parliament established Presbyterianism as the polity of the Church of England . Presbyterian government was established in London and Lancashire and in a few other places in England , although Presbyterian hostility to the execution of Charles I and the establishment of the republican Commonwealth of England meant that Parliament never enforced the Presbyterian system in England . The re-establishment of the monarchy in 1660 brought the return of Episcopal church government in England ( and in Scotland for a short time ) ; but the Presbyterian church in England continued in Non-Conformity , outside of the established church . In 1719 a major split , the Salter 's Hall controversy , occurred ; with the majority siding with nontrinitarian views . Thomas Bradbury published several sermons bearing on the controversy , and in 1719 , " An answer to the reproaches cast on the dissenting ministers who subscribed their belief of the Eternal Trinity. " . By the 18th century many English Presbyterian congregations had become Unitarian in doctrine .
In the context of political corruption , a bribe may involve a payment given to a government official in exchange of his use of official powers . Bribery requires two participants : one to give the bribe , and one to take it . Either may initiate the corrupt offering ; for example , a customs official may demand bribes to let through allowed ( or disallowed ) goods , or a smuggler might offer bribes to gain passage . In some countries the culture of corruption extends to every aspect of public life , making it extremely difficult for individuals to operate without resorting to bribes . Bribes may be demanded in order for an official to do something he is already paid to do . They may also be demanded in order to bypass laws and regulations . In addition to their role in private financial gain , bribes are also used to intentionally and maliciously cause harm to another ( i.e . no financial incentive ) . [ citation needed ] In some developing nations , up to half of the population has paid bribes during the past 12 months .
In April 2014 , it was announced that GE was in talks to acquire the global power division of French engineering group Alstom for a figure of around $ 13 billion . A rival joint bid was submitted in June 2014 by Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries ( MHI ) with Siemens seeking to acquire Alstom 's gas turbine business for €3.9 billion , and MHI proposing a joint venture in steam turbines , plus a €3.1 billion cash investment . In June 2014 a formal offer From GE worth $ 17 billion was agreed by the Alstom board . Part of the transaction involved the French government taking a 20 % stake in Alstom to help secure France 's energy and transport interests , and French jobs . A rival offer from Siemens-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was rejected . The acquisition was expected to be completed in 2015 .

The chapter house and Pyx Chamber at Westminster Abbey are in the guardianship of English Heritage , but under the care and management of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster . English Heritage have funded a major programme of work on the chapter house , comprising repairs to the roof , gutters , stonework on the elevations and flying buttresses as well as repairs to the lead light .
In the aftermath of the failed coup , militias loyal to Patassé sought revenge against rebels in many neighborhoods of Bangui and incited unrest including the murder of many political opponents . Eventually , Patassé came to suspect that General François Bozizé was involved in another coup attempt against him , which led Bozizé to flee with loyal troops to Chad . In March 2003 , Bozizé launched a surprise attack against Patassé , who was out of the country . Libyan troops and some 1,000 soldiers of Bemba 's Congolese rebel organization failed to stop the rebels and Bozizé 's forces succeeded in overthrowing Patassé . [ citation needed ]
Subsequently , Plato and Aristotle produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy , which did much to shape later investigations of nature . Their development of deductive reasoning was of particular importance and usefulness to later scientific inquiry . Plato founded the Platonic Academy in 387 BC , whose motto was " Let none unversed in geometry enter here " , and turned out many notable philosophers . Plato 's student Aristotle introduced empiricism and the notion that universal truths can be arrived at via observation and induction , thereby laying the foundations of the scientific method . Aristotle also produced many biological writings that were empirical in nature , focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life . He made countless observations of nature , especially the habits and attributes of plants and animals in the world around him , classified more than 540 animal species , and dissected at least 50 . Aristotle 's writings profoundly influenced subsequent Islamic and European scholarship , though they were eventually superseded in the Scientific Revolution .
Whites ( mainly of Afrikaner , German , British and Portuguese origin ) make up between 4.0 and 7.0 % of the population . Although their percentage of population is decreasing due to emigration and lower birth rates they still form the second-largest population of European ancestry , both in terms of percentage and actual numbers , in Sub-Saharan Africa ( after South Africa ) . The majority of Namibian whites and nearly all those who are mixed race speak Afrikaans and share similar origins , culture , and religion as the white and coloured populations of South Africa . A large minority of whites ( around 30,000 ) trace their family origins back to the German settlers who colonized Namibia prior to the British confiscation of German lands after World War One , and they maintain German cultural and educational institutions . Nearly all Portuguese settlers came to the country from the former Portuguese colony of Angola . The 1960 census reported 526,004 persons in what was then South-West Africa , including 73,464 whites ( 14 % ) .
The Great Garden is an important European baroque garden . The palace itself , however , was largely destroyed by Allied bombing but is currently under reconstruction .

The Great Garden consists of several parts . The most popular ones are the Great Ground and the Nouveau Jardin . At the centre of the Nouveau Jardin is Europe 's highest garden fountain . The historic Garden Theatre inter alia hosted the musicals of the German rock musician Heinz Rudolf Kunze . [ citation needed ]
Confederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the Army of Northern Virginia , the Confederacy 's most famous army . The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at Bentonville , which was a futile attempt by Confederate General Joseph Johnston to slow Union General William Tecumseh Sherman 's advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865 . In April 1865 , after losing the Battle of Morrisville , Johnston surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place , in what is today Durham . North Carolina 's port city of Wilmington was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union , in February 1865 , after the Union won the nearby Second Battle of Fort Fisher , its major defense downriver .
Media requests at the trade show prompted Kondo to consider using orchestral music for the other tracks in the game as well , a notion reinforced by his preference for live instruments . He originally envisioned a full 50-person orchestra for action sequences and a string quartet for more " lyrical moments " , though the final product used sequenced music instead . Kondo later cited the lack of interactivity that comes with orchestral music as one of the main reasons for the decision . Both six- and seven-track versions of the game 's soundtrack were released on November 19 , 2006 , as part of a Nintendo Power promotion and bundled with replicas of the Master Sword and the Hylian Shield .
In 1988 Imperial merged with St Mary 's Hospital Medical School , becoming The Imperial College of Science , Technology and Medicine . In 1995 Imperial launched its own academic publishing house , Imperial College Press , in partnership with World Scientific . Imperial merged with the National Heart and Lung Institute in 1995 and the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School , Royal Postgraduate Medical School ( RPMS ) and the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1997 . In the same year the Imperial College School of Medicine was formally established and all of the property of Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School , the National Heart and Lung Institute and the Royal Postgraduate Medical School were transferred to Imperial as the result of the Imperial College Act 1997 . In 1998 the Sir Alexander Fleming Building was opened by Queen Elizabeth II to provide a headquarters for the College 's medical and biomedical research .
The following sulfonylureas have been commercialized for weed control : amidosulfuron , azimsulfuron , bensulfuron-methyl , chlorimuron-ethyl , ethoxysulfuron , flazasulfuron , flupyrsulfuron-methyl-sodium , halosulfuron-methyl , imazosulfuron , nicosulfuron , oxasulfuron , primisulfuron-methyl , pyrazosulfuron-ethyl , rimsulfuron , sulfometuron-methyl Sulfosulfuron , terbacil , bispyribac-sodium , cyclosulfamuron , and pyrithiobac-sodium . Nicosulfuron , triflusulfuron methyl , and chlorsulfuron are broad-spectrum herbicides that kill plants by inhibiting the enzyme acetolactate synthase . In the 1960s , more than 1 kg/ha ( 0.89 lb/acre ) crop protection chemical was typically applied , while sulfonylureates allow as little as 1 % as much material to achieve the same effect .
Many more artillery pieces had arrived and been dug into batteries . In June , a third bombardment was followed after two days by a successful attack on the Mamelon , but a follow-up assault on the Malakoff failed with heavy losses . During this time the garrison commander , Admiral Nakhimov fell on 30 June 1855.:378 Raglan having also died on 28 June . :460 In August , the Russians again made an attack towards the base at Balaclava , defended by the French , newly arrived Sardinian and Ottoman troops . :461 The resulting battle of Tchernaya was a defeat for the Russians , who suffered heavy casualties .
Street parking in urban neighborhoods is mostly controlled by the franeleros a.k.a . " viene vienes " ( lit . " come on , come on " ) , who ask drivers for a fee to park , in theory to guard the car , but with the implicit threat that the franelero will damage the car if the fee is not paid . Double parking is common ( with franeleros moving the cars as required ) , impeding on the available lanes for traffic to pass . In order to mitigate that and other problems and to raise revenue , 721 parking meters ( as of October 2013 ) , have been installed in the west-central neighborhoods Lomas de Chapultepec , Condesa , Roma , Polanco and Anzures , in operation from 8 AM to 8 PM on weekdays and charging a rate of 2 pesos per 15 minutes , with offenders ' cars booted , costing about 500 pesos to remove . 30 percent of the monthly 16 million-peso ( as of October 2013 ) income from the parking-meter system ( named " ecoParq " ) is earmarked for neighborhood improvements . The granting of the license for all zones exclusively to a new company without experience in operating parking meters , Operadora de Estacionamientos Bicentenario , has generated controversy .
The nature of government under the Angevin monarchs was ill-defined and uncertain . John 's predecessors had ruled using the principle of vis et voluntas , or " force and will " , taking executive and sometimes arbitrary decisions , often justified on the basis that a king was above the law . Both Henry II and Richard had argued that kings possessed a quality of " divine majesty " ; John continued this trend and claimed an " almost imperial status " for himself as ruler . During the 12th century , there were contrary opinions expressed about the nature of kingship , and many contemporary writers believed that monarchs should rule in accordance with the custom and the law , and take counsel of the leading members of the realm . There was as yet no model for what should happen if a king refused to do so . Despite his claim to unique authority within England , John would sometimes justify his actions on the basis that he had taken council with the barons . Modern historians remain divided as to whether John suffered from a case of " royal schizophrenia " in his approach to government , or if his actions merely reflected the complex model of Angevin kingship in the early 13th century .
When maintenance is performed on asphalt pavements , such as milling to remove a worn or damaged surface , the removed material can be returned to a facility for processing into new pavement mixtures . The asphalt/bitumen in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes . With some 95 % of paved roads being constructed of or surfaced with asphalt , a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year . According to industry surveys conducted annually by the Federal Highway Administration and the National Asphalt Pavement Association , more than 99 % of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements , roadbeds , shoulders and embankments .
The last decades of the 19th century saw concerted political campaigns for Irish home rule . Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the Act of Union 1800 after the Irish Rebellion of 1798 , and had suffered a severe famine between 1845 and 1852 . Home rule was supported by the British Prime minister , William Gladstone , who hoped that Ireland might follow in Canada 's footsteps as a Dominion within the empire , but his 1886 Home Rule bill was defeated in Parliament . Although the bill , if passed , would have granted Ireland less autonomy within the UK than the Canadian provinces had within their own federation , many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a security threat to Great Britain or mark the beginning of the break-up of the empire . A second Home Rule bill was also defeated for similar reasons . A third bill was passed by Parliament in 1914 , but not implemented because of the outbreak of the First World War leading to the 1916 Easter Rising .
The Duke and Duchess of York had two children : Elizabeth ( called " Lilibet " by the family ) , and Margaret . The Duke and Duchess and their two daughters lived a relatively sheltered life at their London residence , 145 Piccadilly . They were a close and loving family . One of the few stirs arose when the Canadian Prime Minister , R. B. Bennett , considered the Duke for Governor General of Canada in 1931—a proposal that King George V rejected on the advice of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs , J. H. Thomas .
Larry Heard , a.k.a . " Mr . Fingers " , claims that the term " house " became popular due to many of the early DJs creating music in their own homes using synthesizers and drum machines such as the Roland TR-808 , TR-909 , and the TB 303 . [ citation needed ] These synthesizers were used to create a house subgenre called acid house .
In signal processing , data compression , source coding , or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation . Compression can be either lossy or lossless . Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy . No information is lost in lossless compression . Lossy compression reduces bits by identifying unnecessary information and removing it . The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression . In the context of data transmission , it is called source coding ( encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted ) in opposition to channel coding .
Crystal Bowersox , who has Type-I diabetes , fell ill due to diabetic ketoacidosis on the morning of the girls performance night for the top 20 week and was hospitalized . The schedule was rearranged so the boys performed first and she could perform the following night instead ; she later revealed that Ken Warwick , the show producer , wanted to disqualify her but she begged to be allowed to stay on the show .
Human interference has nearly exterminated the trees in many areas , and , except for the beech forests of the Austrian Alps , forests of deciduous trees are rarely found after the extreme deforestation between the 17th and 19th centuries . The vegetation has changed since the second half of the 20th century , as the high alpine meadows cease to be harvested for hay or used for grazing which eventually might result in a regrowth of forest . In some areas the modern practice of building ski runs by mechanical means has destroyed the underlying tundra from which the plant life can not recover during the non-skiing months , whereas areas that still practice a natural piste type of ski slope building preserve the fragile underlayers .
The Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service ( COATS ) consists of officers and non-commissioned members who conduct training , safety , supervision and administration of nearly 60,000 cadets aged 12 to 18 years in the Canadian Cadet Movement . The majority of members in COATS are officers of the Cadet Instructors Cadre ( CIC ) branch of the CAF . Members of the Reserve Force Sub-Component COATS who are not employed part-time ( Class A ) or full-time ( Class B ) may be held on the " Cadet Instructor Supplementary Staff List " ( CISS List ) in anticipation of employment in the same manner as other reservists are held as members of the Supplementary Reserve .
Saint Helena was first settled by the English in 1659 , and the island has a population of about 4,250 inhabitants , mainly descended from people from Britain – settlers ( " planters " ) and soldiers – and slaves who were brought there from the beginning of settlement – initially from Africa ( the Cape Verde Islands , Gold Coast and west coast of Africa are mentioned in early records ) , then India and Madagascar . Eventually the planters felt there were too many slaves and no more were imported after 1792 .
By 1989 Germany was nearing reunification and the Cold War was coming to a close . Army leadership reacted by starting to plan for a reduction in strength . By November 1989 Pentagon briefers were laying out plans to reduce army end strength by 23 % , from 750,000 to 580,000 . A number of incentives such as early retirement were used . In 1990 Iraq invaded its smaller neighbor , Kuwait , and U.S. land forces , quickly deployed to assure the protection of Saudi Arabia . In January 1991 Operation Desert Storm commenced , a U.S.-led coalition which deployed over 500,000 troops , the bulk of them from U.S. Army formations , to drive out Iraqi forces . The campaign ended in total victory , as Western coalition forces routed the Iraqi Army , organized along Soviet lines , in just one hundred hours .
Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the first of many to present the Alps as a place of allure and beauty , banishing the prevalent conception of the mountains as a hellish wasteland inhabited by demons . Rousseau 's conception of alpine purity was later emphasized with the publication of Albrecht von Haller 's poem Die Alpen that described the mountains as an area of mythical purity . Late in the 18th century the first wave of Romantics such as Goethe and Turner came to admire the scenery ; Wordsworth visited the area in 1790 , writing of his experiences in The Prelude . Schiller later wrote the play William Tell romanticising Swiss independence . After the end of the Napoleonic Wars , the Alpine countries began to see an influx of poets , artists , and musicians , as visitors came to experience the sublime effects of monumental nature .
In his book The Crucifixion of Jesus , physician and forensic pathologist Frederick Zugibe studied the likely circumstances of the death of Jesus in great detail . Zugibe carried out a number of experiments over several years to test his theories while he was a medical examiner . These studies included experiments in which volunteers with specific weights were hanging at specific angles and the amount of pull on each hand was measured , in cases where the feet were also secured or not . In these cases the amount of pull and the corresponding pain was found to be significant .
The Houston Theater District , located downtown , is home to nine major performing arts organizations and six performance halls . It is the second-largest concentration of theater seats in a downtown area in the United States . Houston is one of few United States cities with permanent , professional , resident companies in all major performing arts disciplines : opera ( Houston Grand Opera ) , ballet ( Houston Ballet ) , music ( Houston Symphony Orchestra ) , and theater ( The Alley Theatre ) . Houston is also home to folk artists , art groups and various small progressive arts organizations . Houston attracts many touring Broadway acts , concerts , shows , and exhibitions for a variety of interests . Facilities in the Theater District include the Jones Hall—home of the Houston Symphony Orchestra and Society for the Performing Arts—and the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts .
In March 2008 , it was announced that Avicenna 's name would be used for new Directories of education institutions for health care professionals , worldwide . The Avicenna Directories will list universities and schools where doctors , public health practitioners , pharmacists and others , are educated . The project team stated " Why Avicenna ? Avicenna ... was ... noted for his synthesis of knowledge from both east and west . He has had a lasting influence on the development of medicine and health sciences . The use of Avicenna 's name symbolises the worldwide partnership that is needed for the promotion of health services of high quality . "
New Haven is a notable center for higher education . Yale University , at the heart of downtown , is one of the city 's best known features and its largest employer . New Haven is also home to Southern Connecticut State University , part of the Connecticut State University System , and Albertus Magnus College , a private institution . Gateway Community College has a campus in downtown New Haven , formerly located in the Long Wharf district ; Gateway consolidated into one campus downtown into a new state-of-the-art campus ( on the site of the old Macy 's building ) and was open for the Fall 2012 semester .
Similarly , forensic anthropologists draw on highly heritable morphological features of human remains ( e.g . cranial measurements ) to aid in the identification of the body , including in terms of race . In a 1992 article , anthropologist Norman Sauer noted that anthropologists had generally abandoned the concept of race as a valid representation of human biological diversity , except for forensic anthropologists . He asked , " If races do n't exist , why are forensic anthropologists so good at identifying them ? " He concluded :
Regarding the timing of German rapprochement , many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov , whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany , removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany . Stalin immediately directed Molotov to " purge the ministry of Jews . " Given Litvinov 's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition , association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain , and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin , his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany . [ f ] Likewise , Molotov 's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers . The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany . One British official wrote that Litvinov 's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber , while Molotov 's " modus operandi " was " more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan . " Carr argued that the Soviet Union 's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3 , 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany , but rather was Stalin 's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man , namely Molotov , to the Foreign Commissariat . Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations , but that they did not abandon British–French talks . Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany . Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov 's dismissal helped the Soviets with British–French talks , because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions .
Prior to the designation of immunity from the etymological root immunis , which is Latin for " exempt " ; early physicians characterized organs that would later be proven as essential components of the immune system . The important lymphoid organs of the immune system are the thymus and bone marrow , and chief lymphatic tissues such as spleen , tonsils , lymph vessels , lymph nodes , adenoids , and liver . When health conditions worsen to emergency status , portions of immune system organs including the thymus , spleen , bone marrow , lymph nodes and other lymphatic tissues can be surgically excised for examination while patients are still alive .
In 2012 , news was released about a new farming site discovered in Munam-ri , Goseong , Gangwon Province , South Korea , which may be the earliest farmland known to date in east Asia . " No remains of an agricultural field from the Neolithic period have been found in any East Asian country before , the institute said , adding that the discovery reveals that the history of agricultural cultivation at least began during the period on the Korean Peninsula " . The farm was dated between 3600 and 3000 B.C . Pottery , stone projectile points , and possible houses were also found . " In 2002 , researchers discovered prehistoric earthenware , jade earrings , among other items in the area " . The research team will perform accelerator mass spectrometry ( AMS ) dating to retrieve a more precise date for the site .
Sport plays an important role in Estonian culture . After declaring independence from Russia in 1918 , Estonia first competed as a nation at the 1920 Summer Olympics , although the National Olympic Committee was established in 1923 . Estonian athletes took part of the Olympic Games until the country was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 . The 1980 Summer Olympics Sailing regatta was held in the capital city Tallinn . After regaining independence in 1991 , Estonia has participated in all Olympics . Estonia has won most of its medals in athletics , weightlifting , wrestling and cross-country skiing . Estonia has had very good success at the Olympic games given the country 's small population . Estonia 's best results were being ranked 13th in the medal table at the 1936 Summer Olympics , and 12th at the 2006 Winter Olympics .
Cyclone Bebe in 1972 caused severe damage to Funafuti . Funafuti 's Tepuka Vili Vili islet was devastated by Cyclone Meli in 1979 , with all its vegetation and most of its sand swept away during the cyclone . Along with a tropical depression that affected the islands a few days later , Severe Tropical Cyclone Ofa had a major impact on Tuvalu with most islands reporting damage to vegetation and crops . Cyclone Gavin was first identified during 2 March 1997 , and was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1996–97 cyclone season with Cyclones Hina and Keli following later in the season .
Originally , legislative power was exercised by the sovereign acting on the advice of the Curia Regis , or Royal Council , in which important magnates and clerics participated and which evolved into parliament . The so-called Model Parliament included bishops , abbots , earls , barons , and two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough among its members . In 1265 , the Earl of Leicester irregularly called a full parliament without royal authorisation . The body eventually came to be divided into two branches : bishops , abbots , earls , and barons formed the House of Lords , while the shire and borough representatives formed the House of Commons . The King would seek the advice and consent of both houses before making any law . During Henry VI 's reign , it became regular practice for the two houses to originate legislation in the form of bills , which would not become law unless the sovereign 's assent was obtained , as the sovereign was , and still remains , the enactor of laws . Hence , all acts include the clause " Be it enacted by the Queen 's ( King 's ) most Excellent Majesty , by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal , and Commons , in this present Parliament assembled , and by the authority of the same , as follows ... " . The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 provide a second potential preamble if the House of Lords were to be excluded from the process .
From the middle of the 18th century , exploration and publication changed the course of British architecture towards a purer vision of the Ancient Greco-Roman ideal . James 'Athenian ' Stuart 's work The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece was very influential in this regard , as were Robert Wood 's Palmyra and Baalbec . A combination of simple forms and high levels of enrichment was adopted by the majority of contemporary British architects and designers . The revolution begun by Stuart was soon to be eclipsed by the work of the Adam Brothers , James Wyatt , Sir William Chambers , George Dance , James Gandon and provincially based architects such as John Carr and Thomas Harrison of Chester .
In testimony before the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science , and Transportation on June 3 , 2008 , former director of the CFTC Division of Trading & Markets ( responsible for enforcement ) Michael Greenberger specifically named the Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange , founded by Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and BP as playing a key role in speculative run-up of oil futures prices traded off the regulated futures exchanges in London and New York . However , the IntercontinentalExchange ( ICE ) had been regulated by both European and U.S. authorities since its purchase of the International Petroleum Exchange in 2001 . Mr Greenberger was later corrected on this matter .
This technique was very expensive , though , and could not be used for applications such as telemedicine , distance education , and business meetings . Attempts at using normal telephony networks to transmit slow-scan video , such as the first systems developed by AT & T Corporation , first researched in the 1950s , failed mostly due to the poor picture quality and the lack of efficient video compression techniques . The greater 1 MHz bandwidth and 6 Mbit/s bit rate of the Picturephone in the 1970s also did not achieve commercial success , mostly due to its high cost , but also due to a lack of network effect —with only a few hundred Picturephones in the world , users had extremely few contacts they could actually call to , and interoperability with other videophone systems would not exist for decades .
In May 1778 , Burke supported a parliamentary motion revising restrictions on Irish trade . His constituents , citizens of the great trading city of Bristol , however urged Burke to oppose free trade with Ireland . Burke resisted their protestations and said : " If , from this conduct , I shall forfeit their suffrages at an ensuing election , it will stand on record an example to future representatives of the Commons of England , that one man at least had dared to resist the desires of his constituents when his judgment assured him they were wrong " .
Paris and its close suburbs is home to numerous newspapers , magazines and publications including Le Monde , Le Figaro , Libération , Le Nouvel Observateur , Le Canard enchaîné , La Croix , Pariscope , Le Parisien ( in Saint-Ouen ) , Les Échos , Paris Match ( Neuilly-sur-Seine ) , Réseaux & Télécoms , Reuters France , and L'Officiel des Spectacles . France 's two most prestigious newspapers , Le Monde and Le Figaro , are the centrepieces of the Parisian publishing industry . Agence France-Presse is France 's oldest , and one of the world 's oldest , continually operating news agencies . AFP , as it is colloquially abbreviated , maintains its headquarters in Paris , as it has since 1835 . France 24 is a television news channel owned and operated by the French government , and is based in Paris . Another news agency is France Diplomatie , owned and operated by the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs , and pertains solely to diplomatic news and occurrences .
On July 1 , 2014 , the University of Notre Dame and Under Armour reached an agreement in which Under Armour will provide uniforms , apparel , equipment , and monetary compensation to Notre Dame for 10 years . This contract , worth almost $ 100 million , is the most lucrative in the history of the NCAA . The university marching band plays at home games for most of the sports . The band , which began in 1846 and has a claim as the oldest university band in continuous existence in the United States , was honored by the National Music Council as a " Landmark of American Music " during the United States Bicentennial . The band regularly plays the school 's fight song the Notre Dame Victory March , which was named as the most played and most famous fight song by Northern Illinois Professor William Studwell . According to College Fight Songs : An Annotated Anthology published in 1998 , the " Notre Dame Victory March " ranks as the greatest fight song of all time .
Russell 's ministry , though Whig , was not favoured by the Queen . She found particularly offensive the Foreign Secretary , Lord Palmerston , who often acted without consulting the Cabinet , the Prime Minister , or the Queen . Victoria complained to Russell that Palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without her knowledge , but Palmerston was retained in office and continued to act on his own initiative , despite her repeated remonstrances . It was only in 1851 that Palmerston was removed after he announced the British government 's approval of President Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte 's coup in France without consulting the Prime Minister . The following year , President Bonaparte was declared Emperor Napoleon III , by which time Russell 's administration had been replaced by a short-lived minority government led by Lord Derby .
In 1906 , the tungsten filament was introduced . Tungsten metal was initially not available in a form that allowed it to be drawn into fine wires . Filaments made from sintered tungsten powder were quite fragile . By 1910 , a process was developed by William D. Coolidge at General Electric for production of a ductile form of tungsten . The process required pressing tungsten powder into bars , then several steps of sintering , swaging , and then wire drawing . It was found that very pure tungsten formed filaments that sagged in use , and that a very small " doping " treatment with potassium , silicon , and aluminium oxides at the level of a few hundred parts per million greatly improved the life and durability of the tungsten filaments .
The Polish term " szlachta " designated the formalized , hereditary noble class of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth . In official Latin documents of the old Commonwealth , hereditary szlachta are referred to as " nobilitas " and are indeed the equivalent in legal status of the English nobility .
The quick German victory over the French stunned neutral observers , many of whom had expected a French victory and most of whom had expected a long war . The strategic advantages possessed by the Germans were not appreciated outside Germany until after hostilities had ceased . Other countries quickly discerned the advantages given to the Germans by their military system , and adopted many of their innovations , particularly the General Staff , universal conscription and highly detailed mobilization systems .
The Greek men 's national volleyball team has won two bronze medals , one in the European Volleyball Championship and another one in the European Volleyball League , a 5th place in the Olympic Games and a 6th place in the FIVB Volleyball Men 's World Championship . The Greek league , the A1 Ethniki , is considered one of the top volleyball leagues in Europe and the Greek clubs have made significant success in European competitions . Olympiacos is the most successful volleyball club in the country having won the most domestic titles and being the only Greek club to have won European titles ; they have won two CEV Cups , they have been CEV Champions League runners-up twice and they have played in as many as 12 Final Fours in the European competitions , making them one of the most traditional volleyball clubs in Europe . Iraklis have also seen significant success in European competitions , having been three times runners-up of the CEV Champions League .
Berry Gordy , Jr. founded Motown Records which rose to prominence during the 1960s and early 1970s with acts such as Stevie Wonder , The Temptations , The Four Tops , Smokey Robinson & The Miracles , Diana Ross & The Supremes , the Jackson 5 , Martha and the Vandellas , The Spinners , Gladys Knight & the Pips , The Marvelettes , The Elgins , The Monitors , The Velvelettes and Marvin Gaye . Artists were backed by in-house vocalists The Andantes and The Funk Brothers , the Motown house band that was featured in Paul Justman 's 2002 documentary film Standing in the Shadows of Motown , based on Allan Slutsky 's book of the same name .
Royal assent is the method by which a country 's constitutional monarch ( possibly through a delegated official ) formally approves an act of that nation 's parliament , thus making it a law or letting it be promulgated as law . In the vast majority of contemporary monarchies , this act is considered to be little more than a formality ; even in those nations which still permit their ruler to withhold the royal assent ( such as the United Kingdom , Norway , and Liechtenstein ) , the monarch almost never does so , save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government . While the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in European monarchies , it is exceedingly rare in the modern , democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century .
For African Americans , the one-drop rule was a significant factor in ethnic solidarity . African Americans generally shared a common cause in society regardless of their multiracial admixture , or social/economic stratification . Additionally , African Americans found it , near , impossible to learn about their Indigenous American heritage as many family elders withheld pertinent genealogical information . Tracing the genealogy of African Americans can be a very difficult process , especially for descendants of Indigenous Americans , because African Americans who were slaves were forbidden to learn to read and write , and a majority of Indigenous Americans neither spoke English , nor read or wrote it .
The two neurotransmitters that are used most widely in the vertebrate brain are glutamate , which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons , and gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , which is almost always inhibitory . Neurons using these transmitters can be found in nearly every part of the brain . Because of their ubiquity , drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects . Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate ; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA .
At Maecenas ' insistence ( according to the tradition ) Virgil spent the ensuing years ( perhaps 37–29 BC ) on the long didactic hexameter poem called the Georgics ( from Greek , " On Working the Earth " ) which he dedicated to Maecenas . The ostensible theme of the Georgics is instruction in the methods of running a farm . In handling this theme , Virgil follows in the didactic ( " how to " ) tradition of the Greek poet Hesiod 's Works and Days and several works of the later Hellenistic poets . The four books of the Georgics focus respectively on raising crops and trees ( 1 and 2 ) , livestock and horses ( 3 ) , and beekeeping and the qualities of bees ( 4 ) . Well-known passages include the beloved Laus Italiae of Book 2 , the prologue description of the temple in Book 3 , and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3 . Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative , in the form of an epyllion which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by Aristaeus and the story of Orpheus ' journey to the underworld . Ancient scholars , such as Servius , conjectured that the Aristaeus episode replaced , at the emperor 's request , a long section in praise of Virgil 's friend , the poet Gallus , who was disgraced by Augustus , and who committed suicide in 26 BC .
President Abraham Lincoln visited General Grant at Petersburg on April 3 , and took a launch to Richmond the next day , while Jefferson Davis attempted to organize his Confederate government at Danville . Lincoln met Confederate assistant secretary of War John A. Campbell , and handed him a note inviting Virginia 's legislature to end their rebellion . After Campbell spun the note to Confederate legislators as a possible end to the Emancipation Proclamation , Lincoln rescinded his offer and ordered General Weitzel to prevent the Confederate state legislature from meeting . Union forces killed , wounded or captured 8000 Confederate troops at Saylor 's Creek southwest of Petersburg on April 6 . General Lee continued to reject General Grant 's surrender suggestion until Sheridan 's infantry and cavalry appeared in front of his retreating army on April 8 . He surrendered his remaining approximately 10000 troops at Appomattox Court House the following morning . Jefferson Davis retreated to North Carolina , then further south . when Lincoln rejected the surrender terms negotiated by general Sherman and envoys of North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance , which failed to mention slavery . Davis was captured on May 10 near Irwinville , Georgia and taken back to Virginia , where he was charged with treason and imprisoned for two years at Fort Monroe until freed on bail .
An urban civilization , the Garamantes , arose around 500 BCE in the heart of the Sahara , in a valley that is now called the Wadi al-Ajal in Fezzan , Libya . The Garamantes achieved this development by digging tunnels far into the mountains flanking the valley to tap fossil water and bring it to their fields . The Garamantes grew populous and strong , conquering their neighbors and capturing many slaves ( which were put to work extending the tunnels ) . The ancient Greeks and the Romans knew of the Garamantes and regarded them as uncivilized nomads . However , they traded with the Garamantes , and a Roman bath has been found in the Garamantes capital of Garama . Archaeologists have found eight major towns and many other important settlements in the Garamantes territory . The Garamantes civilization eventually collapsed after they had depleted available water in the aquifers and could no longer sustain the effort to extend the tunnels further into the mountains .
The Roman legions first entered the area under Decimus Junius Brutus in 137–136 BC , but the country was only incorporated into the Roman Empire by the time of Augustus ( 29 BC – 19 BC ) . The Romans were interested in Galicia mainly for its mineral resources , most notably gold . Under Roman rule , most Galician hillforts began to be – sometimes forcibly – abandoned , and Gallaeci served frequently in the Roman army as auxiliary troops . Romans brought new technologies , new travel routes , new forms of organizing property , and a new language ; latin . The Roman Empire established its control over Galicia through camps ( castra ) as Aquis Querquennis , Ciadella camp or Lucus Augusti ( Lugo ) , roads ( viae ) and monuments as the lighthouse known as Tower of Hercules , in Corunna , but the remoteness and lesser interest of the country since the 2nd century of our era , when the gold mines stopped being productive , led to a lesser degree of Romanization . In the 3rd century it was made a province , under the name Gallaecia , which included also northern Portugal , Asturias , and a large section of what today is known as Castile and León .
In 1964 , Nikita Khrushchev was removed from his position of power and replaced with Leonid Brezhnev . Under his rule , the Russian SFSR and the rest of the Soviet Union went through an era of stagnation . Even after he died in 1982 , the era didn’t end until Mikhail Gorbachev took power and introduced liberal reforms in Soviet society .
Scotland , meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom . In 1603 , that changed when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England , and consequently the Crown of Ireland also . The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval , religious division and war . English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster . Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament . A prime issue was , inter alia , over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism . The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England . Ireland , largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king . Following defeat to the parliaments army , large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English ( Hiberno-Norman ) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland . The new ruling class was Protestant and British , whilst the common people were largely Catholic and Irish . This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come . When the monarchy was restored in England , the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland . The " Glorious Revolution " of 1688 repeated similar themes : a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England . The king 's army was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial Battle of Aughrim in Ireland . Resistance held out , and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the Treaty of Limerick . However , in the evolving political climate , the terms of Limerick were superseded , a new monarchy was installed , and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws , which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics .
There were aspirated stops at three places of articulation : labial , coronal , and velar /pʰ tʰ kʰ/ . Earlier Greek , represented by Mycenaean Greek , likely had a labialized velar aspirated stop /kʷʰ/ , which later became labial , coronal , or velar depending on dialect and phonetic environment .
Napoleon continued to entertain a grand scheme to establish a French presence in the Middle East in order to put pressure on Britain and Russia , and perhaps form an alliance with the Ottoman Empire . In February 1806 , Ottoman Emperor Selim III finally recognized Napoleon as Emperor . He also opted for an alliance with France , calling France " our sincere and natural ally . " That decision brought the Ottoman Empire into a losing war against Russia and Britain . A Franco-Persian alliance was also formed between Napoleon and the Persian Empire of Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar . It collapsed in 1807 , when France and Russia themselves formed an unexpected alliance . In the end , Napoleon had made no effective alliances in the Middle East .
Despite the city 's recent financial issues , many developers remain unfazed by Detroit 's problems . Midtown is one of the most successful areas within Detroit to have a residential occupancy rate of 96 % . Numerous developments have been recently completely or are in various stages of construction . These include the $ 82 million reconstruction of downtown 's David Whitney Building ( now an Aloft Hotel and luxury residences ) , the Woodward Garden Block Development in Midtown , the residential conversion of the David Broderick Tower in downtown , the rehabilitation of the Book Cadillac Hotel ( now a Westin and luxury condos ) and Fort Shelby Hotel ( now Doubletree ) also in downtown , and various smaller projects .
In addition , most Grand Lodges require the candidate to declare a belief in a Supreme Being . In a few cases , the candidate may be required to be of a specific religion . The form of Freemasonry most common in Scandinavia ( known as the Swedish Rite ) , for example , accepts only Christians . At the other end of the spectrum , " Liberal " or Continental Freemasonry , exemplified by the Grand Orient de France , does not require a declaration of belief in any deity , and accepts atheists ( a cause of discord with the rest of Freemasonry ) .
Since chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides dissolve in fats and are not excreted , organisms tend to retain them almost indefinitely . Biological magnification is the process whereby these chlorinated hydrocarbons ( pesticides ) are more concentrated at each level of the food chain . Among marine animals , pesticide concentrations are higher in carnivorous fishes , and even more so in the fish-eating birds and mammals at the top of the ecological pyramid . Global distillation is the process whereby pesticides are transported from warmer to colder regions of the Earth , in particular the Poles and mountain tops . Pesticides that evaporate into the atmosphere at relatively high temperature can be carried considerable distances ( thousands of kilometers ) by the wind to an area of lower temperature , where they condense and are carried back to the ground in rain or snow .
New York 's high rate of public transit use , over 200,000 daily cyclists as of 2014 , and many pedestrian commuters make it the most energy-efficient major city in the United States . Walk and bicycle modes of travel account for 21 % of all modes for trips in the city ; nationally the rate for metro regions is about 8 % . In both its 2011 and 2015 rankings , Walk Score named New York City the most walkable large city in the United States . Citibank sponsored the introduction of 10,000 public bicycles for the city 's bike-share project in the summer of 2013 . Research conducted by Quinnipiac University showed that a majority of New Yorkers support the initiative . New York City 's numerical " in-season cycling indicator " of bicycling in the city hit an all-time high in 2013 .
People of all ages and social statuses were depicted in the art of the Hellenistic age . Artists such as Peiraikos chose mundane and lower class subjects for his paintings . According to Pliny , " He painted barbers ' shops , cobblers ' stalls , asses , eatables and similar subjects , earning for himself the name of rhyparographos [ painter of dirt/low things ] . In these subjects he could give consummate pleasure , selling them for more than other artists received for their large pictures " ( Natural History , Book XXXV.112 ) . Even barbarians , such as the Galatians , were depicted in heroic form , prefiguring the artistic theme of the noble savage . The image of Alexander the Great was also an important artistic theme , and all of the diadochi had themselves depicted imitating Alexander 's youthful look . A number of the best-known works of Greek sculpture belong to the Hellenistic period , including Laocoön and his Sons , Venus de Milo , and the Winged Victory of Samothrace .
Maintaining the household was the main duty of samurai women . This was especially crucial during early feudal Japan , when warrior husbands were often traveling abroad or engaged in clan battles . The wife , or okugatasama ( meaning : one who remains in the home ) , was left to manage all household affairs , care for the children , and perhaps even defend the home forcibly . For this reason , many women of the samurai class were trained in wielding a polearm called a naginata or a special knife called the kaiken in an art called tantojutsu ( lit . the skill of the knife ) , which they could use to protect their household , family , and honor if the need arose .
It would appear that living organisms are remarkably inefficient ( in the physical sense ) in their use of the energy they receive ( chemical energy or radiation ) , and it is true that most real machines manage higher efficiencies . In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose , as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from . The second law of thermodynamics states that energy ( and matter ) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe : to concentrate energy ( or matter ) in one specific place , it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy ( as heat ) across the remainder of the universe ( " the surroundings " ) . [ note 3 ] Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones , but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that are not available to their simpler brethren . The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in ecology : to take just the first step in the food chain , of the estimated 124.7 Pg/a of carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis , 64.3 Pg/a ( 52 % ) are used for the metabolism of green plants , i.e . reconverted into carbon dioxide and heat .
General Bonaparte and his expedition eluded pursuit by the Royal Navy and landed at Alexandria on 1 July . He fought the Battle of Shubra Khit against the Mamluks , Egypt 's ruling military caste . This helped the French practice their defensive tactic for the Battle of the Pyramids , fought on 21 July , about 24 km ( 15 mi ) from the pyramids . General Bonaparte 's forces of 25,000 roughly equalled those of the Mamluks ' Egyptian cavalry . Twenty-nine French and approximately 2,000 Egyptians were killed . The victory boosted the morale of the French army .
Among Richmond 's most interesting architectural features is its Cast-iron architecture . Second only to New Orleans in its concentration of cast iron work , the city is home to a unique collection of cast iron porches , balconies , fences , and finials . Richmond 's position as a center of iron production helped to fuel its popularity within the city . At the height of production in the 1890 , 25 foundries operated in the city employing nearly 3,500 metal workers . This number is seven times the number of general construction workers being employed in Richmond at the time which illustrates the importance of its iron exports . Porches and fences in urban neighborhoods such as Jackson Ward , Church Hill , and Monroe Ward are particularly elaborate , often featuring ornate iron casts never replicated outside of Richmond . In some cases cast were made for a single residential or commercial application .
The pricing of risk refers to the incremental compensation required by investors for taking on additional risk , which may be measured by interest rates or fees . Several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks ' risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis , enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have , and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward , readily understandable format .
In the 1990s , initiatives were taken at an international level ( in particular by the European Community , the Council of Europe , the OECD ) to put a ban on corruption : in 1996 , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe , for instance , adopted a comprehensive Programme of Action against Corruption and , subsequently , issued a series of anti-corruption standard-setting instruments :
General Dong Zhuo ( d. 192 AD ) found the young emperor and his brother wandering in the countryside . He escorted them safely back to the capital and was made Minister of Works , taking control of Luoyang and forcing Yuan Shao to flee . After Dong Zhuo demoted Emperor Shao and promoted his brother Liu Xie as Emperor Xian , Yuan Shao led a coalition of former officials and officers against Dong , who burned Luoyang to the ground and resettled the court at Chang'an in May 191 AD . Dong Zhuo later poisoned Emperor Shao .
The community was established by several shiploads of settlers from Bermuda ( which lies due east of South Carolina , although at 1,030 km or 640 mi , it is closest to Cape Hatteras , North Carolina ) , under the leadership of governor William Sayle , on the west bank of the Ashley River , a few miles northwest of the present-day city center . It was soon predicted by the Earl of Shaftesbury , one of the Lords Proprietors , to become a " great port towne " , a destiny the city quickly fulfilled . In 1680 , the settlement was moved east of the Ashley River to the peninsula between the Ashley and Cooper Rivers . Not only was this location more defensible , but it also offered access to a fine natural harbor .
Hospitals in Liberia include the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Monrovia and several others . Life expectancy in Liberia is estimated to be 57.4 years in 2012 . With a fertility rate of 5.9 births per woman , the maternal mortality rate stood at 990 per 100,000 births in 2010 . A number of highly communicable diseases are widespread , including tuberculosis , diarrheal diseases and malaria . In 2007 , the HIV infection rates stood at 2 % of the population aged 15–49 whereas the incidence of tuberculosis was 420 per 100,000 people in 2008 . Approximately 58.2 % – 66 % of women are estimated to have undergone female genital mutilation .
Humans and animals exposed to vacuum will lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes , but the symptoms are not nearly as graphic as commonly depicted in media and popular culture . The reduction in pressure lowers the temperature at which blood and other body fluids boil , but the elastic pressure of blood vessels ensures that this boiling point remains above the internal body temperature of 37 °C . Although the blood will not boil , the formation of gas bubbles in bodily fluids at reduced pressures , known as ebullism , is still a concern . The gas may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation , but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture . Swelling and ebullism can be restrained by containment in a flight suit . Shuttle astronauts wore a fitted elastic garment called the Crew Altitude Protection Suit ( CAPS ) which prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kPa ( 15 Torr ) . Rapid boiling will cool the skin and create frost , particularly in the mouth , but this is not a significant hazard .
On 1 July 1967 , BBC Two became the first television channel in Europe to broadcast regularly in colour , using the West German PAL system that is still in use today although being gradually superseded by digital systems . ( BBC One and ITV began 625-line colour broadcasts simultaneously on 15 November 1969 ) . Unlike other terrestrial channels , BBC Two does not have soap opera or standard news programming , but a range of programmes intended to be eclectic and diverse ( although if a programme has high audience ratings it is often eventually repositioned to BBC One ) . The different remit of BBC2 allowed its first controller , Sir David Attenborough to commission the first heavyweight documentaries and documentary series such as Civilisation , The Ascent of Man and Horizon .
Concurrently , the Somali Transitional Federal Government began preparations to revive the national postal service . The government 's overall reconstruction plan for Somali Post is structured into three Phases spread out over a period of ten years . Phase I will see the reconstruction of the postal headquarters and General Post Office ( GPO ) , as well as the establishment of 16 branch offices in the capital and 17 in regional bases . As of March 2012 , the Somali authorities have re-established Somalia 's membership with the Universal Postal Union ( UPU ) , and taken part once again in the Union 's affairs . They have also rehabilitated the GPO in Mogadishu , and appointed an official Postal Consultant to provide professional advice on the renovations . Phase II of the rehabilitation project involves the construction of 718 postal outlets from 2014 to 2016 . Phase III is slated to begin in 2017 , with the objective of creating 897 postal outlets by 2022 .
Because of its simple atomic structure , consisting only of a proton and an electron , the hydrogen atom , together with the spectrum of light produced from it or absorbed by it , has been central to the development of the theory of atomic structure . Furthermore , the corresponding simplicity of the hydrogen molecule and the corresponding cation H+ 2 allowed fuller understanding of the nature of the chemical bond , which followed shortly after the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom had been developed in the mid-1920s .
An individual wrestler may sometimes use their real name , or a minor variation of it , for much of their career , such as Angelo Poffo , Ernie Ladd , Verne Gagne , Bret Hart , and Randy Orton . Others can keep one ring name for their entire career ( cases in point include Chris Jericho , Shawn Michaels , CM Punk and Ricky Steamboat ) , or may change from time to time to better suit the demands of the audience or company . Sometimes a character is owned and trademarked by the company , forcing the wrestler to find a new one when they leave ( although a simple typeset change , such as changing Rhyno to Rhino , can usually get around this ) , and sometimes a character is owned by the wrestler . Sometimes , a wrestler may change their legal name in order to obtain ownership of their ring name ( examples include Andrew Martin and Warrior ) . Many wrestlers ( such as The Rock and The Undertaker ) are strongly identified with their character , even responding to the name in public or between friends . It 's actually considered proper decorum for fellow wrestlers to refer to each other by their stage names/characters rather than their birth/legal names , unless otherwise introduced . A professional wrestling character 's popularity can grow to the point that it makes appearances in other media ( see Hulk Hogan and El Santo ) or even give the performer enough visibility to enter politics ( Antonio Inoki and Jesse Ventura , among others ) .
In March 2003 , a second rebel group , Movement for Democracy in Liberia , began launching attacks against Taylor from the southeast . Peace talks between the factions began in Accra in June of that year , and Taylor was indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone for crimes against humanity that same month . By July 2003 , the rebels had launched an assault on Monrovia . Under heavy pressure from the international community and the domestic Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace movement , Taylor resigned in August 2003 and went into exile in Nigeria .
The 100th meridian roughly corresponds with the line that divides the Great Plains into an area that receive 20 inches ( 510 millimetres ) or more of rainfall per year and an area that receives less than 20 in ( 510 mm ) . In this context , the High Plains , as well as Southern Alberta , south-western Saskatchewan and Eastern Montana are mainly semi hot steppe land and are generally characterised by rangeland or marginal farmland . The region ( especially the High Plains ) is periodically subjected to extended periods of drought ; high winds in the region may then generate devastating dust storms . The eastern Great Plains near the eastern boundary falls in the humid subtropical climate zone in the southern areas , and the northern and central areas fall in the humid continental climate .
The domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago . This may have originally been as a result of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild , but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity . Domesticated chickens may have been used for cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs , but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive-bred source of food . Selective breeding for fast growth , egg-laying ability , conformation , plumage and docility took place over the centuries , and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors . Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems , most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises . Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally and , along with eggs , provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat . All poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked in order to reduce the risk of food poisoning .
Others have argued that excessive regulation suppresses therapeutic innovation , and that the current cost of regulator-required clinical trials prevents the full exploitation of new genetic and biological knowledge for the treatment of human disease . A 2012 report by the President 's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology made several key recommendations to reduce regulatory burdens to new drug development , including 1 ) expanding the FDA 's use of accelerated approval processes , 2 ) creating an expedited approval pathway for drugs intended for use in narrowly defined populations , and 3 ) undertaking pilot projects designed to evaluate the feasibility of a new , adaptive drug approval process .
Although Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli honored Mary as the Mother of God in the 16th century , they did so less than Martin Luther . Thus the idea of respect and high honor for Mary was not rejected by the first Protestants ; but , they came to criticize the Roman Catholics for venerating Mary . Following the Council of Trent in the 16th century , as Marian veneration became associated with Catholics , Protestant interest in Mary decreased . During the Age of the Enlightenment any residual interest in Mary within Protestant churches almost disappeared , although Anglicans and Lutherans continued to honor her .
The Bibliothèque nationale de France ( BnF ) operates public libraries in Paris , among them the François Mitterrand Library , Richelieu Library , Louvois , Opéra Library , and Arsenal Library . There are three public libraries in the 4th arrondissement . The Forney Library , in the Marais district , is dedicated to the decorative arts ; the Arsenal Library occupies a former military building , and has a large collection on French literature ; and the Bibliothèque historique de la ville de Paris , also in Le Marais , contains the Paris historical research service . The Sainte-Geneviève Library is in 5th arrondissement ; designed by Henri Labrouste and built in the mid-1800s , it contains a rare book and manuscript division . Bibliothèque Mazarine , in the 6th arrondissement , is the oldest public library in France . The Médiathèque Musicale Mahler in the 8th arrondissement opened in 1986 and contains collections related to music . The François Mitterrand Library ( nicknamed Très Grande Bibliothèque ) in the 13th arrondissement was completed in 1994 to a design of Dominique Perrault and contains four glass towers .
For any prime number p , there is also the multiplicative group of integers modulo p. Its elements are the integers 1 to p − 1 . The group operation is multiplication modulo p. That is , the usual product is divided by p and the remainder of this division is the result of modular multiplication . For example , if p = 5 , there are four group elements 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . In this group , 4 · 4 = 1 , because the usual product 16 is equivalent to 1 , which divided by 5 yields a remainder of 1. for 5 divides 16 − 1 = 15 , denoted
The Xiongnu , a nomadic steppe confederation , defeated the Han in 200 BC and forced the Han to submit as a de facto inferior partner , but continued their raids on the Han borders . Emperor Wu of Han ( r. 141–87 BC ) launched several military campaigns against them . The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries . These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia , divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations , and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road , which reached as far as the Mediterranean world . The territories north of Han 's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation . Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south , annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC , and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC .
Tanzania : Dar es Salaam was the torch 's only stop in Africa , on April 13 . The relay began at the grand terminal of the TAZARA Railway , which was China 's largest foreign aid project of the 1970s , and continued for 5 km through the old city to the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium in Temeke , which was built with Chinese aid in 2005 . The torch was lit by Vice-President Ali Mohamed Shein . About a thousand people followed the relay , waving the Olympic flag . The only noted instance of protest was Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai 's withdrawal from the list of torchbearers , in protest against human rights abuses in Tibet .
John spent much of 1205 securing England against a potential French invasion . As an emergency measure , John recreated a version of Henry II 's Assize of Arms of 1181 , with each shire creating a structure to mobilise local levies . When the threat of invasion faded , John formed a large military force in England intended for Poitou , and a large fleet with soldiers under his own command intended for Normandy . To achieve this , John reformed the English feudal contribution to his campaigns , creating a more flexible system under which only one knight in ten would actually be mobilised , but would be financially supported by the other nine ; knights would serve for an indefinite period . John built up a strong team of engineers for siege warfare and a substantial force of professional crossbowmen . The king was supported by a team of leading barons with military expertise , including William Longespée , William the Marshal , Roger de Lacy and , until he fell from favour , the marcher lord William de Braose .
The University of Kansas ( KU ) is a public research university and the largest in the U.S. state of Kansas . KU branch campuses are located in the towns of Lawrence , Wichita , Overland Park , Salina , and Kansas City , Kansas , with the main campus located in Lawrence on Mount Oread , the highest location in Lawrence . Founded March 21 , 1865 , the university was opened in 1866 , under a charter granted by the Kansas State Legislature in 1864 following enabling legislation passed in 1863 under the Kansas State Constitution , adopted two years after the 1861 admission of the former Kansas Territory as the 34th state into the Union following a very famous bloody internal civil war known as " Bleeding Kansas " during the 1850s .
In 1873 , one of the first papers in modern medicine on the subject tried to explain the pathophysiology of the disease while one in 1872 , concluded that asthma can be cured by rubbing the chest with chloroform liniment . Medical treatment in 1880 , included the use of intravenous doses of a drug called pilocarpin . In 1886 , F.H . Bosworth theorized a connection between asthma and hay fever . Epinephrine was first referred to in the treatment of asthma in 1905 . Oral corticosteroids began to be used for this condition in the 1950s while inhaled corticosteroids and selective short acting beta agonist came into wide use in the 1960s .
Whitehead did not begin his career as a philosopher . In fact , he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education . Early in his life he showed great interest in and respect for philosophy and metaphysics , but it is evident that he considered himself a rank amateur . In one letter to his friend and former student Bertrand Russell , after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive , he wrote : " This further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic , onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter . " Ironically , in later life Whitehead would become one of the 20th century 's foremost metaphysicians .
The name Nigeria was taken from the Niger River running through the country . This name was allegedly coined in the late 19th century by British journalist Flora Shaw , she was inspired by the name of the river , in preference to terms such as " Central Sudan " . The origin of the name " Nigeria " came from the name of the Niger River . The word ( Niger ) is an alteration of the Tuareg name egerew n-igerewen used by inhabitants along the middle reaches of the river around Timbuktu prior to 19th-century European colonialism . Egerew n-igerewen means River of the Rivers .
Highbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak , and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s . The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season , thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators . This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards , so much so that for two seasons , from 1998 to 2000 , Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley , which could house more than 70,000 spectators .
The Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that jñāna ( knowledge ) is a sufficient means to moksha . It suggests that systematic techniques/practice ( personal experimentation ) combined with Samkhya 's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha . Yoga shares several central ideas with Advaita Vedanta , with the difference that Yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while Advaita Vedanta is a form of monistic personalism . Like Advaita Vedanta , the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy states that liberation/freedom in this life is achievable , and this occurs when an individual fully understands and realizes the equivalence of Atman ( soul , self ) and Brahman .
Lee modeled the character of Dill on her childhood friend , Truman Capote , known then as Truman Persons . Just as Dill lived next door to Scout during the summer , Capote lived next door to Lee with his aunts while his mother visited New York City . Like Dill , Capote had an impressive imagination and a gift for fascinating stories . Both Lee and Capote were atypical children : both loved to read . Lee was a scrappy tomboy who was quick to fight , but Capote was ridiculed for his advanced vocabulary and lisp . She and Capote made up and acted out stories they wrote on an old Underwood typewriter Lee 's father gave them . They became good friends when both felt alienated from their peers ; Capote called the two of them " apart people " . In 1960 , Capote and Lee traveled to Kansas together to investigate the multiple murders that were the basis for Capote 's nonfiction novel In Cold Blood .
Despite its relative lexical unity , the two dialectal blocks of Catalan ( Eastern and Western ) show some differences in word choices . Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism . Also , usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element .
According to the Institute of Russian Language of the Russian Academy of Sciences , an optional acute accent ( знак ударения ) may , and sometimes should , be used to mark stress . For example , it is used to distinguish between otherwise identical words , especially when context does not make it obvious : замо́к/за́мок ( lock/castle ) , сто́ящий/стоя́щий ( worthwhile/standing ) , чудно́/чу́дно ( this is odd/this is marvelous ) , молоде́ц/мо́лодец ( attaboy/fine young man ) , узна́ю/узнаю́ ( I shall learn it/I recognize it ) , отреза́ть/отре́зать ( to be cutting/to have cut ) ; to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words , especially personal and family names ( афе́ра , гу́ру , Гарси́я , Оле́ша , Фе́рми ) , and to show which is the stressed word in a sentence ( Ты́ съел печенье ? /Ты съе́л печенье ? /Ты съел пече́нье ? – Was it you who ate the cookie ? /Did you eat the cookie ? /Was it the cookie that you ate ? ) . Stress marks are mandatory in lexical dictionaries and books for children or Russian learners .
Ephesus is a cultic centre of Mary , the site of the first Church dedicated to her and the rumoured place of her death . Ephesus was previously a centre for worship of Artemis a virgin goddess . The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus being regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World The cult of Mary was furthered by Queen Theodora in the 6th Century . According to William E. Phipps , in the book Survivals of Roman Religion " Gordon Laing argues convincingly that the worship of Artemis as both virgin and mother at the grand Ephesian temple contributed to the veneration of Mary . "
Meanwhile , the Industrial Revolution laid open the door for mass production and consumption . Aesthetics became a criterion for the middle class as ornamented products , once within the province of expensive craftsmanship , became cheaper under machine production .
London i/ˈlʌndən/ is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom . Standing on the River Thames in the south eastern part of the island of Great Britain , London has been a major settlement for two millennia . It was founded by the Romans , who named it Londinium . London 's ancient core , the City of London , largely retains its 1.12-square-mile ( 2.9 km2 ) medieval boundaries and in 2011 had a resident population of 7,375 , making it the smallest city in England . Since at least the 19th century , the term London has also referred to the metropolis developed around this core . The bulk of this conurbation forms Greater London , [ note 1 ] a region of England governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly . [ note 2 ] The conurbation also covers two English counties : the small district of the City of London and the county of Greater London . The latter constitutes the vast majority of London , though historically it was split between Middlesex ( a now abolished county ) , Essex , Surrey , Kent and Hertfordshire .
Throughout its prehistory and early history , the region and its vicinity in the Yangtze region was the cradle of unique local civilizations which can be dated back to at least the 15th century BC and coinciding with the later years of the Shang and Zhou dynasties in North China . Sichuan was referred to in ancient Chinese sources as Ba-Shu ( 巴蜀 ) , an abbreviation of the kingdoms of Ba and Shu which existed within the Sichuan Basin . Ba included Chongqing and the land in eastern Sichuan along the Yangtze and some tributary streams , while Shu included today 's Chengdu , its surrounding plain and adjacent territories in western Sichuan .
Significant legislative changes in the status of the szlachta , as defined by Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries , consist of its 1374 exemption from the land tax , a 1425 guarantee against the 'arbitrary arrests and/or seizure of property ' of its members , a 1454 requirement that military forces and new taxes be approved by provincial Sejms , and statutes issued between 1496 and 1611 that prescribed the rights of commoners .
Under the Köppen climate classification , using the 0 °C ( 32 °F ) coldest month ( January ) isotherm , New York City itself experiences a humid subtropical climate ( Cfa ) and is thus the northernmost major city on the North American continent with this categorization . The suburbs to the immediate north and west lie in the transition zone from a humid subtropical ( Cfa ) to a humid continental climate ( Dfa ) . The area averages 234 days with at least some sunshine annually , and averages 57 % of possible sunshine annually , accumulating 2,535 hours of sunshine per annum . The city falls under USDA 7b Plant Hardiness zone .
By 1640 , the town 's theocratic government and nine-square grid plan were in place , and the town was renamed Newhaven from Quinnipiac . However , the area north of New Haven remained Quinnipiac until 1678 , when it was renamed Hamden . The settlement became the headquarters of the New Haven Colony . At the time , the New Haven Colony was separate from the Connecticut Colony , which had been established to the north centering on Hartford . One of the principal differences between the two colonies was that the New Haven colony was an intolerant theocracy that did not permit other churches to be established , while the Connecticut colony permitted the establishment of other churches .
In 1902 , the Siemens company developed a tantalum lamp filament . These lamps were more efficient than even graphitized carbon filaments and could operate at higher temperatures . Since tantalum metal has a lower resistivity than carbon , the tantalum lamp filament was quite long and required multiple internal supports . The metal filament had the property of gradually shortening in use ; the filaments were installed with large loops that tightened in use . This made lamps in use for several hundred hours quite fragile . Metal filaments had the property of breaking and re-welding , though this would usually decrease resistance and shorten the life of the filament . General Electric bought the rights to use tantalum filaments and produced them in the US until 1913 .
In 1977 , Elizabeth marked the Silver Jubilee of her accession . Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth , many coinciding with her associated national and Commonwealth tours . The celebrations re-affirmed the Queen 's popularity , despite virtually coincident negative press coverage of Princess Margaret 's separation from her husband . In 1978 , the Queen endured a state visit to the United Kingdom by Romania 's communist dictator , Nicolae Ceaușescu , and his wife , Elena , though privately she thought they had " blood on their hands " . The following year brought two blows : one was the unmasking of Anthony Blunt , former Surveyor of the Queen 's Pictures , as a communist spy ; the other was the assassination of her relative and in-law Lord Mountbatten by the Provisional Irish Republican Army .
During the period of North–South division , Nanjing remained the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries . During this time , Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia . Based on historical documents , the city had 280,000 registered households . Assuming an average Nanjing household had about 5.1 people at that time , the city had more than 1.4 million residents .
Unlike most other cities , Strasbourg 's collections of European art are divided into several museums according not only to type and area , but also to epoch . Old master paintings from the Germanic Rhenish territories and until 1681 are displayed in the Musée de l'Œuvre Notre-Dame , old master paintings from all the rest of Europe ( including the Dutch Rhenish territories ) and until 1871 as well as old master paintings from the Germanic Rhenish territories between 1681 and 1871 are displayed in the Musée des Beaux-Arts . Old master graphic arts until 1871 is displayed in the Cabinet des estampes et dessins . Decorative arts until 1681 ( " German period " ) are displayed in the Musée de l'Œuvre Notre-Dame , decorative arts from 1681 to 1871 ( " French period " ) are displayed in the Musée des Arts décoratifs . International art ( painting , sculpture , graphic arts ) and decorative art since 1871 is displayed in the Musée d'art moderne et contemporain . The latter museum also displays the city 's photographic library .
The first documented visit by a European was in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano , a Florentine explorer in the service of the French crown , who sailed his ship La Dauphine into New York Harbor . He claimed the area for France and named it " Nouvelle Angoulême " ( New Angoulême ) .
Beyoncé has received numerous awards . As a solo artist she has sold over 15 million albums in the US , and over 118 million records worldwide ( a further 60 million additionally with Destiny 's Child ) , making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time . The Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) listed Beyoncé as the top certified artist of the 2000s , with a total of 64 certifications . Her songs " Crazy in Love " , " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) " , " Halo " , and " Irreplaceable " are some of the best-selling singles of all time worldwide . In 2009 , The Observer named her the Artist of the Decade and Billboard named her the Top Female Artist and Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade . In 2010 , Billboard named her in their " Top 50 R & B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years " list at number 15 . In 2012 VH1 ranked her third on their list of the " 100 Greatest Women in Music " . Beyoncé was the first female artist to be honored with the International Artist Award at the American Music Awards . She has also received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards and the Billboard Millennium Award at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards .
The city is bisected geographically and culturally by the North Canadian River , which basically divides North Oklahoma City and South Oklahoma City . The two halves of the city were actually founded and plotted as separate cities , but soon grew together . The north side is characterized by very diverse and fashionable urban neighborhoods near the city center and sprawling suburbs further north . South Oklahoma City is generally more blue collar working class and significantly more industrial , having grown up around the Stockyards and meat packing plants at the turn of the century , and is currently the center of the city 's rapidly growing Latino community .
After they each performed , both were deemed equal until Apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time . As Apollo played the lyre , this was easy to do . Marsyas could not do this , as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time . Apollo was declared the winner because of this . Apollo flayed Marsyas alive in a cave near Celaenae in Phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god . He then nailed Marsyas ' shaggy skin to a nearby pine-tree . Marsyas ' blood turned into the river Marsyas .
The Bithynians were a Thracian people living in northwest Anatolia . After Alexander 's conquests the region of Bithynia came under the rule of the native king Bas , who defeated Calas , a general of Alexander the Great , and maintained the independence of Bithynia . His son , Zipoetes I of Bithynia maintained this autonomy against Lysimachus and Seleucus I , and assumed the title of king ( basileus ) in 297 BCE . His son and successor , Nicomedes I , founded Nicomedia , which soon rose to great prosperity , and during his long reign ( c. 278 – c. 255 BCE ) , as well as those of his successors , the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia . Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries , and they later turned on his son Prusias I , who defeated them in battle . Their last king , Nicomedes IV , was unable to maintain himself against Mithridates VI of Pontus , and , after being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate , he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the Roman republic ( 74 BCE ) .
In the second half of the 20th Century a modern movement in Nichiren Buddhism : Soka Gakkai ( Value Creation Society ) emerged in Japan and spread further to other countries . Soka Gakkai International ( SGI ) is a lay Buddhist movement linking more than 12 million people around the world , and is currently described as " the most diverse " and " the largest lay Buddhist movement in the world " .

In 1579 the northern seven provinces signed the Union of Utrecht , in which they decided to join forces against Spanish rule . The Union of Utrecht is seen as the beginning of the Dutch Republic . In 1580 the new and predominantly Protestant state abolished the bishoprics , including the archbishopric of Utrecht . The stadtholders disapproved of the independent course of the Utrecht bourgeoisie and brought the city under much more direct control of the republic ; which shifted the power towards its dominant province Holland . This was the start of a long period of stagnation of trade and development in Utrecht . Utrecht remained an atypical city in the new republic with about 40 % Catholic in the mid-17th century , and even more among the elite groups , who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there .
On December 15 , 2012 , several news outlets reported that President Barack Obama would nominate Kerry to succeed Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State , after Susan Rice , widely seen as Obama 's preferred choice , withdrew her name from consideration citing a politicized confirmation process following criticism of her response to the 2012 Benghazi attack . On December 21 , Obama proposed the nomination which received positive commentary . His confirmation hearing took place on January 24 , 2013 , before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , the same panel where he first testified in 1971 . The committee unanimously voted to approve him on January 29 , 2013 , and the same day the full Senate confirmed him on a vote of 94–3 . In a letter to Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick , Kerry announced his resignation from the Senate effective February 1 .
From 1877 to 1878 , the area suffered a rash of stagecoach robberies . Most notable , however , were the two holdups committed by masked road-agent William Whitney Brazelton . Brazelton held up two stages in the summer of 1878 near Point of Mountain Station approximately 17 mi ( 27 km ) northwest of Tucson . John Clum , of Tombstone , Arizona fame was one of the passengers . Brazelton was eventually tracked down and killed on Monday August 19 , 1878 , in a mesquite bosque along the Santa Cruz River 3 miles ( 5 km ) south of Tucson by Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell and his citizen 's posse . Brazelton had been suspected of highway robbery not only in the Tucson area , but also in the Prescott region and Silver City , New Mexico area as well . Brazelton 's crimes prompted John J. Valentine , Sr. of Wells , Fargo & Co. to send special agent and future Pima County sheriff Bob Paul to investigate . Fort Lowell , then east of Tucson , was established to help protect settlers from Apache attacks . In 1882 , Frank Stilwell was implicated in the murder of Morgan Earp by Cowboy Pete Spence 's wife , Marietta , at the coroner 's inquest on Morgan Earp 's shooting . The coroner 's jury concluded that Spence , Stilwell , Frederick Bode , and Florentino " Indian Charlie " Cruz were the prime suspects in the assassination of Morgan Earp . :250 Deputy U.S . Marshal Wyatt Earp gathered a few trusted friends and accompanied Virgil Earp and his family as they traveled to Benson for a train ride to California . They found Stilwell lying in wait for Virgil in the Tucson station and killed him on the tracks . After killing Stilwell , Wyatt deputized others and rode on a vendetta , killing three more cowboys over the next few days before leaving the state .
Much of the study in the madrasah college centred on examining whether certain opinions of law were orthodox . This scholarly process of " determining orthodoxy began with a question which the Muslim layman , called in that capacity mustaftī , presented to a jurisconsult , called mufti , soliciting from him a response , called fatwa , a legal opinion ( the religious law of Islam covers civil as well as religious matters ) . The mufti ( professor of legal opinions ) took this question , studied it , researched it intensively in the sacred scriptures , in order to find a solution to it . This process of scholarly research was called ijtihād , literally , the exertion of one 's efforts to the utmost limit . "
Left-wing politics have been particularly strong in municipal government since the 1960s . Voters approved charter amendments that have lessened the penalties for possession of marijuana ( 1974 ) , and that aim to protect access to abortion in the city should it ever become illegal in the State of Michigan ( 1990 ) . In 1974 , Kathy Kozachenko 's victory in an Ann Arbor city-council race made her the country 's first openly homosexual candidate to win public office . In 1975 , Ann Arbor became the first U.S. city to use instant-runoff voting for a mayoral race . Adopted through a ballot initiative sponsored by the local Human Rights Party , which feared a splintering of the liberal vote , the process was repealed in 1976 after use in only one election . As of August 2009 , Democrats hold the mayorship and all council seats . The left tilt of politics in the city has earned it the nickname " The People 's Republic of Ann Arbor " . Nationally , Ann Arbor is located in Michigan 's 12th congressional district , represented by Democrat Debbie Dingell .
In the 2000 presidential election , Vice President Al Gore , a former Democratic U.S . Senator from Tennessee , failed to carry his home state , an unusual occurrence but indicative of strengthening Republican support . Republican George W. Bush received increased support in 2004 , with his margin of victory in the state increasing from 4 % in 2000 to 14 % in 2004 . Democratic presidential nominees from Southern states ( such as Lyndon B. Johnson , Jimmy Carter , Bill Clinton ) usually fare better than their Northern counterparts do in Tennessee , especially among split-ticket voters outside the metropolitan areas .
The popular sports in Tuvalu include kilikiti , Ano , football , futsal , volleyball , handball , basketball and rugby union . Tuvalu has sports organisations for athletics , badminton , tennis , table tennis , volleyball , football , basketball , rugby union , weightlifting and powerlifting . At the 2013 Pacific Mini Games , Tuau Lapua Lapua won Tuvalu 's first gold medal in an international competition in the weightlifting 62 kilogram male snatch . ( He also won bronze in the clean and jerk , and obtained the silver medal overall for the combined event . ) In 2015 Telupe Iosefa received the first gold medal won by Tuvalu at the Pacific Games in the powerlifting 120 kg male division .
The army employs various individual weapons to provide light firepower at short ranges . The most common weapons used by the army are the compact variant of the M16 rifle , the M4 carbine , as well as the 7.62×51mm variant of the FN SCAR for Army Rangers . The primary sidearm in the U.S. Army is the 9 mm M9 pistol ; the M11 pistol is also used . Both handguns are to be replaced through the Modular Handgun System program . Soldiers are also equiped with various hand grenades , such as the M67 fragmentation grenade and M18 smoke grenade .
In the 11th century , a turbulent period occurred in the history of Maritime Southeast Asia . The Indian Chola navy crossed the ocean and attacked the Srivijaya kingdom of Sangrama Vijayatungavarman in Kadaram ( Kedah ) , the capital of the powerful maritime kingdom was sacked and the king was taken captive . Along with Kadaram , Pannai in present-day Sumatra and Malaiyur and the Malayan peninsula were attacked too . Soon after that , the king of Kedah Phra Ong Mahawangsa became the first ruler to abandon the traditional Hindu faith , and converted to Islam with the Sultanate of Kedah established in year 1136 . Samudera Pasai converted to Islam in the year 1267 , the King of Malacca Parameswara married the princess of Pasai , and the son became the first sultan of Malacca . Soon , Malacca became the center of Islamic study and maritime trade , and other rulers followed suit . Indonesian religious leader and Islamic scholar Hamka ( 1908–1981 ) wrote in 1961 : " The development of Islam in Indonesia and Malaya is intimately related to a Chinese Muslim , Admiral Zheng He . "
In the 2001 census Southampton and Portsmouth were recorded as being parts of separate urban areas , however by the time of the 2011 census they had merged to become the sixth largest built-up area in England with a population of 855,569 . This built-up area is part of the metropolitan area known as South Hampshire , which is also known as Solent City , particularly in the media when discussing local governance organisational changes . With a population of over 1.5 million this makes the region one of the United Kingdom 's most populous metropolitan areas .
Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations , both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae . With low frequencies , the stylus must swing a long way from side to side , requiring the groove to be wide , taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record . At high frequencies , hiss , pops , and ticks are significant . These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard . During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced , thus reducing the groove width required , and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased . The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal ; this also reduces the high frequency noise . Thus more music will fit on the record , and noise is reduced .
New York City is the most-populous city in the United States , with an estimated record high of 8,491,079 residents as of 2014 , incorporating more immigration into the city than outmigration since the 2010 United States Census . More than twice as many people live in New York City as in the second-most populous U.S. city ( Los Angeles ) , and within a smaller area . New York City gained more residents between April 2010 and July 2014 ( 316,000 ) than any other U.S. city . New York City 's population amounts to about 40 % of New York State 's population and a similar percentage of the New York metropolitan area population .
New Haven was home to one of the important early events in the burgeoning anti-slavery movement when , in 1839 , the trial of mutineering Mende tribesmen being transported as slaves on the Spanish slaveship Amistad was held in New Haven 's United States District Court . There is a statue of Joseph Cinqué , the informal leader of the slaves , beside City Hall . See " Museums " below for more information . Abraham Lincoln delivered a speech on slavery in New Haven in 1860 , shortly before he secured the Republican nomination for President .
In recent years it has become common for many AC stations , particularly soft AC stations , to play primarily or exclusively Christmas music during the Christmas season in November and December . While these tend mostly to be contemporary seasonal recordings by the same few artists featured under the normal format , most stations will also air some vintage holiday tunes from older pop , MOR , and adult standards artists – such as Nat King Cole , Bing Crosby , Dean Martin , The Carpenters , Percy Faith , Johnny Mathis and Andy Williams – many of whom would never be played on these stations during the rest of the year .
Many older buildings in certain areas of Boston are supported by wooden piles driven into the area 's fill ; these piles remain sound if submerged in water , but are subject to dry rot if exposed to air for long periods . Groundwater levels have been dropping , to varying degrees , in many areas of the city , due in part to an increase in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground . A city agency , the Boston Groundwater Trust , coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells . However , Boston 's drinking water supply , from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs to the west , is one of the very few in the country so pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration .
In the early part of the 20th century , Atlantic City went through a radical building boom . Many of the modest boarding houses that dotted the boardwalk were replaced with large hotels . Two of the city 's most distinctive hotels were the Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel and the Traymore Hotel .
While most of mainland Greece and the Aegean islands was under Ottoman control by the end of the 15th century , Cyprus and Crete remained Venetian territory and did not fall to the Ottomans until 1571 and 1670 respectively . The only part of the Greek-speaking world that escaped long-term Ottoman rule was the Ionian Islands , which remained Venetian until their capture by the First French Republic in 1797 , then passed to the United Kingdom in 1809 until their unification with Greece in 1864 .

While full-time work hinders schooling , empirical evidence is varied on the relationship between part-time work and school . Sometimes even part-time work may hinder school attendance or performance . On the other hand , many poor children work for resources to attend school . Children who are not doing well at school sometimes seek more satisfactory experience in work . Good relations with a supervisor at work can provide relief from tensions that children feel at school and home . In the modern world , school education has become so central to society that schoolwork has become the dominant work for most children , often replacing participation in productive work . If school curricula or quality do not provide children with appropriate skills for available jobs or if children do nor have the aptitude for schoolwork , school may impede the learning of skills , such as agriculture , which will become necessary for future livelihood .
The event of the Protestant Reformation and the politics that ensued has been cited as the origins of German identity that arose in response to the spread of a common German language and literature . Early German national culture was developed through literary and religious figures including Martin Luther , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller . The concept of a German nation was developed by German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder . The popularity of German identity arose in the aftermath of the French Revolution .
BYU has been considered by some Latter-day Saints , as well as some university and church leaders , to be " The Lord 's university " . This phrase is used in reference to the school 's mission as an " ambassador " to the world for the LDS Church and thus , for Jesus Christ . In the past , some students and faculty have expressed dissatisfaction with this nickname , stating that it gives students the idea that university authorities are always divinely inspired and never to be contradicted . Leaders of the school , however , acknowledge that the nickname represents more a goal that the university strives for and not its current state of being . Leaders encourage students and faculty to help fulfill the goal by following the teachings of their religion , adhering to the school 's honor code , and serving others with the knowledge they gain while attending .
The Desert National Park in Jaisalmer is spread over an area of 3,162 square kilometres ( 1,221 sq mi ) , is an excellent example of the ecosystem of the Thar Desert and its diverse fauna . Seashells and massive fossilised tree trunks in this park record the geological history of the desert . The region is a haven for migratory and resident birds of the desert . One can see many eagles , harriers , falcons , buzzards , kestrels and vultures . Short-toed eagles ( Circaetus gallicus ) , tawny eagles ( Aquila rapax ) , spotted eagles ( Aquila clanga ) , laggar falcons ( Falco jugger ) and kestrels are the commonest of these .
The Partyja BPF ( Belarusian Popular Front ) was established in 1988 as a political party and cultural movement for democracy and independence , à la the Baltic republics’ popular fronts . The discovery of mass graves in Kurapaty outside Minsk by historian Zianon Pazniak , the Belarusian Popular Front’s first leader , gave additional momentum to the pro-democracy and pro-independence movement in Belarus . It claimed that the NKVD performed secret killings in Kurapaty . Initially the Front had significant visibility because its numerous public actions almost always ended in clashes with the police and the KGB .
Referring to great power relations pre-1960 , Joshua Baron highlights that starting from around the 16th century and the rise of several European great powers , military conflicts and confrontations was the defining characteristic of diplomacy and relations between such powers . " Between 1500 and 1953 , there were 64 wars in which at least one great power was opposed to another , and they averaged little more than five years in length . In approximately a 450-year time frame , on average at least two great powers were fighting one another in each and every year . " Even during the period of Pax Britannica ( or " the British Peace " ) between 1815 and 1914 , war and military confrontations among the great powers was still a frequent occurrence . In fact , Joshua Baron points out that , in terms of militarized conflicts or confrontations , the UK led the way in this period with nineteen such instances against ; Russia ( 8 ) , France ( 5 ) , Germany/Prussia ( 5 ) and Italy ( 1 ) .
Airports are divided into landside and airside areas . Landside areas include parking lots , public transportation train stations and access roads . Airside areas include all areas accessible to aircraft , including runways , taxiways and aprons . Access from landside areas to airside areas is tightly controlled at most airports . Passengers on commercial flights access airside areas through terminals , where they can purchase tickets , clear security check , or claim luggage and board aircraft through gates . The waiting areas which provide passenger access to aircraft are typically called concourses , although this term is often used interchangeably with terminal .
Opposition to the union mounted among some of Syria 's key elements , namely the socioeconomic , political , and military elites . In response to Syria 's worsening economy , which Nasser attributed to its control by the bourgeoisie , in July 1961 , Nasser decreed socialist measures that nationalized wide-ranging sectors of the Syrian economy . He also dismissed Sarraj in September to curb the growing political crisis . Aburish states that Nasser was not fully capable of addressing Syrian problems because they were " foreign to him " . In Egypt , the economic situation was more positive , with a GNP growth of 4.5 percent and a rapid growth of industry . In 1960 , Nasser nationalized the Egyptian press , which had already been cooperating with his government , in order to steer coverage towards the country 's socioeconomic issues and galvanize public support for his socialist measures .
The assumption of the use of a two-beamed cross does not determine the number of nails used in the crucifixion and some theories suggest three nails while others suggest four nails . However , throughout history larger numbers of nails have been hypothesized , at times as high as 14 nails . These variations are also present in the artistic depictions of the crucifixion . In the Western Church , before the Renaissance usually four nails would be depicted , with the feet side by side . After the Renaissance most depictions use three nails , with one foot placed on the other . Nails are almost always depicted in art , although Romans sometimes just tied the victims to the cross . The tradition also carries to Christian emblems , e.g . the Jesuits use three nails under the IHS monogram and a cross to symbolize the crucifixion .
Some of Nasser 's liberal and Islamist critics in Egypt , including the founding members of the New Wafd Party and writer Jamal Badawi , dismissed Nasser 's popular appeal with the Egyptian masses during his presidency as being the product of successful manipulation and demagoguery . Egyptian political scientist Alaa al-Din Desouki blamed the 1952 revolution 's shortcomings on Nasser 's concentration of power , and Egypt 's lack of democracy on Nasser 's political style and his government 's limitations on freedom of expression and political participation .
The first Digimon television series , which began airing on March 7 , 1999 in Japan on Fuji TV and Kids Station and on August 14 , 1999 in the United States on Fox Kids dubbed by Saban Entertainment for the North American English version . Its premise is a group of 7 kids who , while at summer camp , travel to the Digital World , inhabited by creatures known as Digital Monsters , or Digimon , learning they are chosen to be " DigiDestined " ( " Chosen Children " in the Japanese version ) to save both the Digital and Real World from evil . Each Kid was given a Digivice which selected them to be transported to the DigiWorld and was destined to be paired up with a Digimon Partner , such as Tai being paired up with Agumon and Matt with Gabumon . The children are helped by a mysterious man/digimon named Gennai , who helps them via hologram . The Digivices help their Digimon allies to Digivolve into stronger creatures in times of peril . The Digimon usually reached higher forms when their human partners are placed in dangerous situations , such as fighting the evil forces of Devimon , Etemon and Myotismon in their Champion forms . Later , each character discovered a crest that each belonged to a person ; Tai the Crest of Courage , Matt the Crest of Friendship , Sora the Crest of Love , Izzy the Crest of Knowledge , Mimi the Crest of Sincerity , Joe the Crest of Reliability , T.K . the Crest of Hope , and later Kari the Crest of Light which allowed their Digimon to digivolve into their Ultimate forms . The group consisted of seven original characters : Taichi " Tai " Kamiya , Yamato " Matt " Ishida , Sora Takenouchi , Koushiro " Izzy " Izumi , Mimi Tachikawa , Joe Kido , and Takeru " T.K . " Takaishi . Later on in the series , an eighth character was introduced : Hikari " Kari " Kamiya ( who is Taichi 's younger sister ) .
In the 1988–89 school year , 301 students per 10,000 population were in specialized secondary or higher education , a figure slightly lower than the Soviet average . In 1989 some 58 % of Armenians over age fifteen had completed their secondary education , and 14 % had a higher education . In the 1990–91 school year , the estimated 1,307 primary and secondary schools were attended by 608,800 students . Another seventy specialized secondary institutions had 45,900 students , and 68,400 students were enrolled in a total of ten postsecondary institutions that included universities . In addition , 35 % of eligible children attended preschools . In 1992 Armenia 's largest institution of higher learning , Yerevan State University , had eighteen departments , including ones for social sciences , sciences , and law . Its faculty numbered about 1,300 teachers and its student population about 10,000 students . The National Polytechnic University of Armenia is operating since 1933 .
The Red Cross Society of China flew 557 tents and 2,500 quilts valued at 788,000 yuan ( US $ 113,000 ) to Wenchuan County . The Amity Foundation already began relief work in the region and has earmarked US $ 143,000 for disaster relief . The Sichuan Ministry of Civil Affairs said that they have provided 30,000 tents for those left homeless .
The influence of Old Norse certainly helped move English from a synthetic language along the continuum to a more analytic word order , and Old Norse most likely made a greater impact on the English language than any other language . The eagerness of Vikings in the Danelaw to communicate with their southern Anglo-Saxon neighbors produced a friction that led to the erosion of the complicated inflectional word-endings . Simeon Potter notes : “No less far-reaching was the influence of Scandinavian upon the inflexional endings of English in hastening that wearing away and leveling of grammatical forms which gradually spread from north to south . It was , after all , a salutary influence . The gain was greater than the loss . There was a gain in directness , in clarity , and in strength.”
Conversely , DST can adversely affect farmers , parents of young children , and others whose hours are set by the sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice , although some farmers are neutral . One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates , so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable . Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change . Their cows are sensitive to the timing of milking , so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems . Today some farmers ' groups are in favor of DST .
In 1930 Thuringia was one of the free states where the Nazis gained real political power . Wilhelm Frick was appointed Minister of the Interior for the state of Thuringia after the Nazi Party won six delegates to the Thuringia Diet . In this position he removed from the Thuringia police force anyone he suspected of being a republican and replaced them with men who were favourable towards the Nazi Party . He also ensured that whenever an important position came up within Thuringia , he used his power to ensure that a Nazi was given that post .
European cultural ideas and institutions began to follow colonial expansion into other parts of the world . There was also a rise , especially toward the end of the era , of nationalism in music ( echoing , in some cases , political sentiments of the time ) , as composers such as Edvard Grieg , Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov , and Antonín Dvořák echoed traditional music of their homelands in their compositions .
Martin Luther , a German monk , started the German Reformation by posting 95 theses on the castle church of Wittenberg on October 31 , 1517 . The immediate provocation spurring this act was Pope Leo X’s renewal of the indulgence for the building of the new St. Peter 's Basilica in 1514 . Luther was challenged to recant his heresy at the Diet of Worms in 1521 . When he refused , he was placed under the ban of the Empire by Charles V. Receiving the protection of Frederick the Wise , he was then able to translate the Bible into German .
Nanjing is endowed with rich natural resources , which include more than 40 kinds of minerals . Among them , iron and sulfur reserves make up 40 percent of those of Jiangsu province . Its reserves of strontium rank first in East Asia and the South East Asia region . Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources , both from the Yangtze River and groundwater . In addition , it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in Jiangning and Tangquan Hot Spring in Pukou .
The constitution of the Fifth Republic states that French alone is the official language of the Republic . However , Alsatian , along with other regional languages , are recognized by the French government in the official list of languages of France . A 1999 INSEE survey counted 548,000 adult speakers of Alsatian in France , making it the second most-spoken regional language in the country ( after Occitan ) . Like all regional languages in France , however , the transmission of Alsatian is on the decline . While 39 % of the adult population of Alsace speaks Alsatian , only one in four children speaks it , and only one in ten children uses it regularly .
The West Campus is located about one mile ( 1.6 km ) to the west of the Danforth Campus in Clayton , Missouri , and primarily consists of a four-story former department store building housing mostly administrative space . The West Campus building was home to the Clayton branch of the Famous-Barr department store until 1990 , when the University acquired the property and adjacent parking and began a series of renovations . Today , the basement level houses the West Campus Library , the University Archives , the Modern Graphic History Library , and conference space . The ground level still remains a retail space . The upper floors house consolidated capital gifts , portions of alumni and development , and information systems offices from across the Danforth and Medical School campuses . There is also a music rehearsal room on the second floor . The West Campus is also home to the Center for the Application of Information Technologies ( CAIT ) , which provides IT training services .
In September 1695 , Captain Henry Every , an English pirate on board the Fancy , reached the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb , where he teamed up with five other pirate captains to make an attack on the Indian fleet making the annual voyage to Mocha . The Mughal convoy included the treasure-laden Ganj-i-Sawai , reported to be the greatest in the Mughal fleet and the largest ship operational in the Indian Ocean , and its escort , the Fateh Muhammed . They were spotted passing the straits en route to Surat . The pirates gave chase and caught up with Fateh Muhammed some days later , and meeting little resistance , took some £50,000 to £60,000 worth of treasure .
Following a steady decline , beginning in the late 1990s up through the mid-2000s , illicit drug use among adolescents has been on the rise in the U.S. Aside from alcohol , marijuana is the most commonly indulged drug habit during adolescent years . Data collected by the National Institute on Drug Abuse shows that between the years of 2007 and 2011 , marijuana use grew from 5.7 % to 7.2 % among 8th grade students ; among 10th grade students , from 14.2 % to 17.6 % ; and among 12th graders , from 18.8 % to 22.6 % . Additional , recent years have seen a surge in popularity of MDMA ; between 2010 and 2011 , the use of MDMA increased from 1.4 % to 2.3 % among high school seniors . The heightened usage of ecstasy most likely ties in at least to some degree with the rising popularity of rave culture .
Next to sound shifts , there are ample examples of suffix differences . Often simple suffix shifts ( like switching between -the , -ske , -ke , -je , ... ) , sometimes the suffixes even depend on quite specific grammar rules for a certain dialect . Again taking West Flemish as an example . In that language , the words " ja " ( yes ) and " nee " ( no ) are also conjugated to the ( often implicit ) subject of the sentence . These separate grammar rules are a lot more difficult to imitate correctly than simple sound shifts , making it easy to recognise people who did n't grow up in a certain region , even decades after they moved .
Islamic tradition relates that Muhammad received his first revelation in the Cave of Hira during one of his isolated retreats to the mountains . Thereafter , he received revelations over a period of 23 years . According to hadith and Muslim history , after Muhammad immigrated to Medina and formed an independent Muslim community , he ordered many of his companions to recite the Quran and to learn and teach the laws , which were revealed daily . It is related that some of the Quraysh who were taken prisoners at the battle of Badr regained their freedom after they had taught some of the Muslims the simple writing of the time . Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate . As it was initially spoken , the Quran was recorded on tablets , bones , and the wide , flat ends of date palm fronds . Most suras were in use amongst early Muslims since they are mentioned in numerous sayings by both Sunni and Shia sources , relating Muhammad 's use of the Quran as a call to Islam , the making of prayer and the manner of recitation . However , the Quran did not exist in book form at the time of Muhammad 's death in 632 . There is agreement among scholars that Muhammad himself did not write down the revelation .
People with prolonged , frequent , or close contact with people with TB are at particularly high risk of becoming infected , with an estimated 22 % infection rate . A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 ( or more ) other people per year . Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious . The probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon several factors , including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier , the effectiveness of ventilation , the duration of exposure , the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain , the level of immunity in the uninfected person , and others . The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active ( " overt " ) TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens . After about two weeks of effective treatment , subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others . If someone does become infected , it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others .
In the days following the disaster , an international reconnaissance team of engineers was dispatched to the region to make a detailed preliminary survey of damaged buildings . Their findings show a variety of reasons why many constructions failed to withstand the earthquake .
Late in the 19th century , Paris hosted two major international expositions : the 1889 Universal Exposition , was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution and featured the new Eiffel Tower ; and the 1900 Universal Exposition , which gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III , the Grand Palais , the Petit Palais and the first Paris Métro line . Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism ( Émile Zola ) and Symbolism ( Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine ) , and of Impressionism in art ( Courbet , Manet , Monet , Renoir . )
Copper compounds in liquid form are used as a wood preservative , particularly in treating original portion of structures during restoration of damage due to dry rot . Together with zinc , copper wires may be placed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss . [ citation needed ] Textile fibers use copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics , as do ceramic glazes , stained glass and musical instruments . Electroplating commonly uses copper as a base for other metals such as nickel .
There are at least 3,223 named lakes and reservoirs in Montana , including Flathead Lake , the largest natural freshwater lake in the western United States . Other major lakes include Whitefish Lake in the Flathead Valley and Lake McDonald and St. Mary Lake in Glacier National Park . The largest reservoir in the state is Fort Peck Reservoir on the Missouri river , which is contained by the second largest earthen dam and largest hydraulically filled dam in the world . Other major reservoirs include Hungry Horse on the Flathead River ; Lake Koocanusa on the Kootenai River ; Lake Elwell on the Marias River ; Clark Canyon on the Beaverhead River ; Yellowtail on the Bighorn River , Canyon Ferry , Hauser , Holter , Rainbow ; and Black Eagle on the Missouri River .
Some of Chopin 's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles , such as the Revolutionary Étude ( Op . 10 , No . 12 ) , and the Minute Waltz ( Op . 64 , No . 1 ) . However , with the exception of his Funeral March , the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number , leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener ; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others . There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind ; it merely appeared at that time . The Funeral March , the third movement of his Sonata No . 2 ( Op . 35 ) , the one case where he did give a title , was written before the rest of the sonata , but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it .
The artificial intelligence ( AI ) of enemies in Twilight Princess is more advanced than that of enemies in The Wind Waker . Enemies react to defeated companions and to arrows or slingshot pellets that pass by , and can detect Link from a greater distance than was possible in previous games .
LaserDiscs potentially had a much longer lifespan than videocassettes . Because the discs were read optically instead of magnetically , no physical contact needs to be made between the player and the disc , except for the player 's clamp that holds the disc at its center as it is spun and read . As a result , playback would not wear the information-bearing part of the discs , and properly manufactured LDs would theoretically last beyond one 's lifetime . By contrast , a VHS tape held all of its picture and sound information on the tape in a magnetic coating which is in contact with the spinning heads on the head drum , causing progressive wear with each use ( though later in VHS 's lifespan , engineering improvements allowed tapes to be made and played back without contact ) . Also , the tape was thin and delicate , and it was easy for a player mechanism , especially on a low quality or malfunctioning model , to mishandle the tape and damage it by creasing it , frilling ( stretching ) its edges , or even breaking it .
A novelty shop called Au Bon Marché had been founded in Paris in 1838 to sell lace , ribbons , sheets , mattresses , buttons , umbrellas and other assorted goods . It originally had four departments , twelve employees , and a floor space of three hundred meters . The entrepreneur Aristide Boucicaut became a partner in 1852 , and changed the marketing plan , instituting fixed prices and guarantees that allowed exchanges and refunds , advertising , and a much wider variety of merchandise . The annual income of the store increased from 500,000 francs in 1852 to five million in 1860 . In 1869 he built much larger building at 24 rue de Sèvres on the Left Bank , and enlarged the store again in 1872 , with help from the engineering firm of Gustave Eiffel , creator of the Eiffel Tower . The income rose from twenty million francs in 1870 to 72 million at the time of the Boucicaut 's death in 1877 . The floor space had increased from three hundred square meters in 1838 to fifty thousand , and the number of employees had increased from twelve in 1838 to 1788 in 1879 . Boucicaut was famous for his marketing innovations ; a reading room for husbands while their wives shopped ; extensive newspaper advertising ; entertainment for children ; and six million catalogs sent out to customers . By 1880 half the employees were women ; unmarried women employees lived in dormitories on the upper floors .
There are quite a few different dielectrics that can be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on the requirements of the circuit . Some of these dielectrics are polytetrafluoroethylene ( Teflon ) , FR-4 , FR-1 , CEM-1 or CEM-3 . Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are FR-2 ( phenolic cotton paper ) , FR-3 ( cotton paper and epoxy ) , FR-4 ( woven glass and epoxy ) , FR-5 ( woven glass and epoxy ) , FR-6 ( matte glass and polyester ) , G-10 ( woven glass and epoxy ) , CEM-1 ( cotton paper and epoxy ) , CEM-2 ( cotton paper and epoxy ) , CEM-3 ( non-woven glass and epoxy ) , CEM-4 ( woven glass and epoxy ) , CEM-5 ( woven glass and polyester ) . Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with ball grid array ( BGA ) and naked die technologies , and glass fiber offers the best dimensional stability .
As in most of eastern China the ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly Han nationality ( 98.56 percent ) , with 50 other minority nationalities . In 1999 , 77,394 residents belonged to minority nationalities , among which the vast majority ( 64,832 ) were Hui nationalities , contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population . The second and third largest minority groups were Manchu ( 2,311 ) and Zhuang ( 533 ) nationalities . Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District , comprising 9.13 percent of the district 's population .
When the Xbox 360 was released , Microsoft 's online gaming service Xbox Live was shut down for 24 hours and underwent a major upgrade , adding a basic non-subscription service called Xbox Live Silver ( later renamed Xbox Live Free ) to its already established premium subscription-based service ( which was renamed Gold ) . Xbox Live Free is included with all SKUs of the console . It allows users to create a user profile , join on message boards , and access Microsoft 's Xbox Live Arcade and Marketplace and talk to other members . A Live Free account does not generally support multiplayer gaming ; however , some games that have rather limited online functions already , ( such as Viva Piñata ) or games that feature their own subscription service ( e.g . EA Sports games ) can be played with a Free account . Xbox Live also supports voice the latter a feature possible with the Xbox Live Vision .
Universal Primary Education is one of the eight international Millennium Development Goals , towards which progress has been made in the past decade , though barriers still remain . Securing charitable funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem . Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have indicated that the main obstacles to funding for education include conflicting donor priorities , an immature aid architecture , and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue . Additionally , Transparency International has identified corruption in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving Universal Primary Education in Africa . Furthermore , demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected . Indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the ongoing costs involved . There is also economic pressure from some parents , who prefer their children to earn money in the short term rather than work towards the long-term benefits of education . [ citation needed ]
In 1978 , Queen toured the US and Canada , and spent much of 1979 touring in Europe and Japan . They released their first live album , Live Killers , in 1979 ; it went platinum twice in the US . Queen also released the very successful single " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " , a rockabilly inspired song done in the style of Elvis Presley . The song made the top 10 in many countries , topped the Australian ARIA Charts for seven consecutive weeks , and was the band 's first number one single in the United States where it topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks . Having written the song on guitar and played rhythm on the record , Mercury played rhythm guitar while performing the song live , which was the first time he ever played guitar in concert . In December 1979 , Queen played the opening night at the Concert for the People of Kampuchea in London , having accepted a request by the event 's organiser Paul McCartney .
Confederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the Army of Northern Virginia , the Confederacy 's most famous army . The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at Bentonville , which was a futile attempt by Confederate General Joseph Johnston to slow Union General William Tecumseh Sherman 's advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865 . In April 1865 , after losing the Battle of Morrisville , Johnston surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place , in what is today Durham . North Carolina 's port city of Wilmington was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union , in February 1865 , after the Union won the nearby Second Battle of Fort Fisher , its major defense downriver .
With filming completed in Rome , production moved to Mexico City in late March to shoot the film 's opening sequence , with scenes to include the Day of the Dead festival filmed in and around the Zócalo and the Centro Histórico district . The planned scenes required the city square to be closed for filming a sequence involving a fight aboard a Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm Bo 105 helicopter flown by stunt pilot Chuck Aaron , which called for modifications to be made to several buildings to prevent damage . This particular scene in Mexico required 1,500 extras , 10 giant skeletons and 250,000 paper flowers . Reports in the Mexican media added that the film 's second unit would move to Palenque in the state of Chiapas , to film aerial manoeuvres considered too dangerous to shoot in an urban area .
Hong Taiji 's bureaucracy was staffed with many Han Chinese , including many newly surrendered Ming officials . The Manchus ' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments . Hong Taiji 's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects . Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had , those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property . Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623 , Nurhachi , who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong , turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted ; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them , while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen ( in Jilin ) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong . Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen " nation " as full ( if not first-class ) citizens , obligated to provide military service . By 1648 , less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry . This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji 's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under his personal control , it also greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily . Through these and other measures Hong Taiji was able to centralize power unto the office of the Khan , which in the long run prevented the Jurchen federation from fragmenting after his death .
To extend and consolidate the dynasty 's control in Central Asia , the Kangxi Emperor personally led a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia . The Kangxi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan 's invading forces from these regions , which were then incorporated into the empire . Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar–Qing War . In 1683 , Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang , grandson of Koxinga , who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing . Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title " Duke Haicheng " ( 海澄公 ) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing . Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662 , including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan ( 朱弘桓 ) , son of Zhu Yihai , where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning . The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution . Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi 's forces for series of battles over Albazin , the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia . Zheng 's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin . The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China 's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries . After Galdan 's death , his followers , as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism , attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama . Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa , the capital of Tibet , and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing .
In October 2004 , Sarah Forsyth claimed that she had been dismissed unfairly by Eton College and had been bullied by senior staff . She also claimed she was instructed to do some of Prince Harry 's coursework to enable him to pass AS Art . As evidence , Forsyth provided secretly recorded conversations with both Prince Harry and her Head of Department , Ian Burke . An employment tribunal in July 2005 found that she had been unfairly dismissed and criticised Burke for bullying her and for repeatedly changing his story . It also criticised the school for failing to produce its capability procedures and criticised the Head Master for not reviewing the case independently .
Most mutations within genes are neutral , having no effect on the organism 's phenotype ( silent mutations ) . Some mutations do not change the amino acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same amino acid ( synonymous mutations ) . Other mutations can be neutral if they lead to amino acid sequence changes , but the protein still functions similarly with the new amino acid ( e.g . conservative mutations ) . Many mutations , however , are deleterious or even lethal , and are removed from populations by natural selection . Genetic disorders are the result of deleterious mutations and can be due to spontaneous mutation in the affected individual , or can be inherited . Finally , a small fraction of mutations are beneficial , improving the organism 's fitness and are extremely important for evolution , since their directional selection leads to adaptive evolution . :7.6
Antibiotics are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use , and are usually considered safe and most are well tolerated . However , some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse side effects . Side-effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used , the microbial organisms targeted , and the individual patient . Side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis . Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use . Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions , including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis . Common side-effects include diarrhea , resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora , resulting , for example , in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria , such as Clostridium difficile . Antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora , and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus Candida in the vulvo-vaginal area . Additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs , such as elevated risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid . Some scientists have hypothesized that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics alter the host microbiota and this has been associated with chronic disease .
Strasbourg , well known as centre of humanism , has a long history of excellence in higher-education , at the crossroads of French and German intellectual traditions . Although Strasbourg had been annexed by the Kingdom of France in 1683 , it still remained connected to the German-speaking intellectual world throughout the 18th century and the university attracted numerous students from the Holy Roman Empire , including Goethe , Metternich and Montgelas , who studied law in Strasbourg , among the most prominent . Nowadays , Strasbourg is known to offer among the best university courses in France , after Paris .
Brood parasitism , in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual 's brood , is more common among birds than any other type of organism . After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird 's nest , they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host 's own brood . Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites , which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young , or non-obligate brood parasites , which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young . One hundred bird species , including honeyguides , icterids , and ducks , are obligate parasites , though the most famous are the cuckoos . Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host 's young , which allows them to destroy the host 's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host 's chicks ; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks .
New Delhi is particularly renowned for its beautifully landscaped gardens that can look quite stunning in spring . The largest of these include Buddha Jayanti Park and the historic Lodi Gardens . In addition , there are the gardens in the Presidential Estate , the gardens along the Rajpath and India Gate , the gardens along Shanti Path , the Rose Garden , Nehru Park and the Railway Garden in Chanakya Puri . Also of note is the garden adjacent to the Jangpura Metro Station near the Defence Colony Flyover , as are the roundabout and neighbourhood gardens throughout the city .
The governments in Berlin , Bremen and Hamburg are designated by the term Senate . In the three free states of Bavaria , Saxony , and Thuringia the government is referred to as the State Government ( Staatsregierung ) , and in the other ten states the term Land Government ( Landesregierung ) is used . Before January 1 , 2000 , Bavaria had a bicameral parliament , with a popularly elected Landtag , and a Senate made up of representatives of the state 's major social and economic groups . The Senate was abolished following a referendum in 1998 . The states of Berlin , Bremen , and Hamburg are governed slightly differently from the other states . In each of those cities , the executive branch consists of a Senate of approximately eight , selected by the state 's parliament ; the senators carry out duties equivalent to those of the ministers in the larger states . The equivalent of the Minister-President is the Senatspräsident ( President of the Senate ) in Bremen , the Erster Bürgermeister ( First Mayor ) in Hamburg , and the Regierender Bürgermeister ( Governing Mayor ) in Berlin . The parliament for Berlin is called the Abgeordnetenhaus ( House of Representatives ) , while Bremen and Hamburg both have a Bürgerschaft . The parliaments in the remaining 13 states are referred to as Landtag ( State Parliament ) .
Only a few contemporary societies are classified as hunter-gatherers , and many supplement their foraging activity with horticulture and/or keeping animals .
In 2005 two city council members , Ralph Inzunza and Deputy Mayor Michael Zucchet – who briefly took over as acting mayor when Murphy resigned – were convicted of extortion , wire fraud , and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for taking campaign contributions from a strip club owner and his associates , allegedly in exchange for trying to repeal the city 's " no touch " laws at strip clubs . Both subsequently resigned . Inzunza was sentenced to 21 months in prison . In 2009 , a judge acquitted Zucchet on seven out of the nine counts against him , and granted his petition for a new trial on the other two charges ; the remaining charges were eventually dropped .
Murdoch found he had such a rapport with Larry Lamb over lunch that other potential recruits as editor were not interviewed and Lamb was appointed as the first editor of the new Sun . He was scathing in his opinion of the Mirror , where he had recently been employed as a senior sub-editor , and shared Murdoch 's view that a paper 's quality was best measured by its sales , and he regarded the Mirror as overstaffed , and primarily aimed at an ageing readership . Lamb hastily recruited a staff of about 125 reporters , who were mostly selected for their availability rather than their ability .
When the Emancipation Proclamation was announced , Tennessee was mostly held by Union forces . Thus , Tennessee was not among the states enumerated in the Proclamation , and the Proclamation did not free any slaves there . Nonetheless , enslaved African Americans escaped to Union lines to gain freedom without waiting for official action . Old and young , men , women and children camped near Union troops . Thousands of former slaves ended up fighting on the Union side , nearly 200,000 in total across the South .
The Soviets also helped Germany to avoid British naval blockades by providing a submarine base , Basis Nord , in the northern Soviet Union near Murmansk . This also provided a refueling and maintenance location , and a takeoff point for raids and attacks on shipping . In addition , the Soviets provided Germany with access to the Northern Sea Route for both cargo ships and raiders ( though only the commerce raider Komet used the route before the German invasion ) , which forced Britain to protect sea lanes in both the Atlantic and the Pacific .
The revolutionary army established large-scale public works programs and successfully implemented an urban and rural literacy campaign , which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate . In addition to a nationalization program of industry and land , the new regime 's foreign policy placed an emphasis on Somalia 's traditional and religious links with the Arab world , eventually joining the Arab League ( AL ) in 1974 . That same year , Barre also served as chairman of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) , the predecessor of the African Union ( AU ) .
On March 18 , 1965 , about a week before the first American piloted Project Gemini space flight , the USSR accelerated the competition , by launching the two-cosmonaut Voskhod 2 mission with Pavel Belyayev and Alexey Leonov . Voskhod 2 's design modifications included the addition of an inflatable airlock to allow for extravehicular activity ( EVA ) , also known as a spacewalk , while keeping the cabin pressurized so that the capsule 's electronics would n't overheat . Leonov performed the first-ever EVA as part of the mission . A fatality was narrowly avoided when Leonov 's spacesuit expanded in the vacuum of space , preventing him from re-entering the airlock . In order to overcome this , he had to partially depressurize his spacesuit to a potentially dangerous level . He succeeded in safely re-entering the ship , but he and Belyayev faced further challenges when the spacecraft 's atmospheric controls flooded the cabin with 45 % pure oxygen , which had to be lowered to acceptable levels before re-entry . The reentry involved two more challenges : an improperly timed retrorocket firing caused the Voskhod 2 to land 386 kilometers ( 240 mi ) off its designated target area , the town of Perm ; and the instrument compartment 's failure to detach from the descent apparatus caused the spacecraft to become unstable during reentry .
Buddhism provides many opportunities for comparative study with a diverse range of subjects . For example , Buddhism 's emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various differing beliefs , customs and institutions in countries where it has resided throughout its history . Also , its moral and spiritual parallels with other systems of thought—for example , with various tenets of Christianity—have been subjects of close study . In addition , the Buddhist concept of dependent origination has been compared to modern scientific thought , as well as Western metaphysics .
Following his triumph , Napoleon imposed the first elements of the Continental System through the Berlin Decree issued in November 1806 . The Continental System , which prohibited European nations from trading with Britain , was widely violated throughout his reign . In the next few months , Napoleon marched against the advancing Russian armies through Poland and was involved in the bloody stalemate at the Battle of Eylau in February 1807 . After a period of rest and consolidation on both sides , the war restarted in June with an initial struggle at Heilsberg that proved indecisive . On 14 June , however , Napoleon finally obtained an overwhelming victory over the Russians at the Battle of Friedland , wiping out the majority of the Russian army in a very bloody struggle . The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French . On 19 June , Czar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon . The latter assured the envoy that the Vistula River represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe . On that basis , the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of Tilsit after meeting on an iconic raft on the River Niemen . The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated : " I hate the English as much as you do . "
The Human Development Report for 2007/2008 was launched in Brasília , Brazil , on November 27 , 2007 . Its focus was on " Fighting climate change : Human solidarity in a divided world . " Most of the data used for the report are derived largely from 2005 or earlier , thus indicating an HDI for 2005 . Not all UN member states choose to or are able to provide the necessary statistics .
In paintings , Mary is traditionally portrayed in blue . This tradition can trace its origin to the Byzantine Empire , from c.500 AD , where blue was " the colour of an empress " . A more practical explanation for the use of this colour is that in Medieval and Renaissance Europe , the blue pigment was derived from the rock lapis lazuli , a stone imported from Afghanistan of greater value than gold . Beyond a painter 's retainer , patrons were expected to purchase any gold or lapis lazuli to be used in the painting . Hence , it was an expression of devotion and glorification to swathe the Virgin in gowns of blue .
There are numerous community and international newspapers locally that cater to the city 's ethnic mosaic ; such as The Black Chronicle , headquartered in the Eastside , the OK VIETIMES and Oklahoma Chinese Times , located in Asia District , and various Hispanic community publications . The Campus is the student newspaper at Oklahoma City University . Gay publications include The Gayly Oklahoman .
BBC Television is a service of the British Broadcasting Corporation . The corporation , which has operated in the United Kingdom under the terms of a Royal charter since 1927 , has produced television programmes from its own since 1932 , although the start of its regular service of television broadcasts is dated to 2 November 1936 .
The other Ancient Greek dialects , Ionic , Doric , Aeolic , and Arcadocypriot , likely had the same three-way distinction at one point , but Doric seems to have had a fricative in place of /tʰ/ in the Classical period , and the Ionic and Aeolic dialects sometimes lost aspiration ( psilosis ) .
Irir Samaale , the oldest common ancestor of several Somali clans , is generally regarded as the source of the ethnonym Somali . The name " Somali " is , in turn , held to be derived from the words soo and maal , which together mean " go and milk " — a reference to the ubiquitous pastoralism of the Somali people . Another plausible etymology proposes that the term Somali is derived from the Arabic for " wealthy " ( dhawamaal ) , again referring to Somali riches in livestock .
Beginning in April 1985 , Madonna embarked on her first concert tour in North America , The Virgin Tour , with the Beastie Boys as her opening act . She progressed from playing CBGB and the Mudd Club to playing large sporting arenas . At that time she released two more hit singles from the album , " Angel " and " Dress You Up " . In July , Penthouse and Playboy magazines published a number of nude photos of Madonna , taken in New York in 1978 . She had posed for the photographs as she needed money at the time , and was paid as little as $ 25 a session . The publication of the photos caused a media uproar , but Madonna remained " unapologetic and defiant " . The photographs were ultimately sold for up to $ 100,000 . She referred to these events at the 1985 outdoor Live Aid charity concert , saying that she would not take her jacket off because " [ the media ] might hold it against me ten years from now . "
Kim Philby , a Soviet double agent , was a correspondent for the newspaper in Spain during the Spanish Civil War of the late 1930s . Philby was admired for his courage in obtaining high-quality reporting from the front lines of the bloody conflict . He later joined MI6 during World War II , was promoted into senior positions after the war ended , then eventually defected to the Soviet Union in 1963 .
The distinctive characteristic of Italian Gothic is the use of polychrome decoration , both externally as marble veneer on the brick façade and also internally where the arches are often made of alternating black and white segments , and where the columns may be painted red , the walls decorated with frescoes and the apse with mosaic . The plan is usually regular and symmetrical , Italian cathedrals have few and widely spaced columns . The proportions are generally mathematically equilibrated , based on the square and the concept of " armonìa " , and except in Venice where they loved flamboyant arches , the arches are almost always equilateral . Colours and moldings define the architectural units rather than blending them . Italian cathedral façades are often polychrome and may include mosaics in the lunettes over the doors . The façades have projecting open porches and occular or wheel windows rather than roses , and do not usually have a tower . The crossing is usually surmounted by a dome . There is often a free-standing tower and baptistry . The eastern end usually has an apse of comparatively low projection . The windows are not as large as in northern Europe and , although stained glass windows are often found , the favourite narrative medium for the interior is the fresco .
The High Middle Ages was a period of tremendous expansion of population . The estimated population of Europe grew from 35 to 80 million between 1000 and 1347 , although the exact causes remain unclear : improved agricultural techniques , the decline of slaveholding , a more clement climate and the lack of invasion have all been suggested . As much as 90 per cent of the European population remained rural peasants . Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities , usually known as manors or villages . These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services , in a system known as manorialism . There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond , with more of them in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north . The practice of assarting , or bringing new lands into production by offering incentives to the peasants who settled them , also contributed to the expansion of population .
The Germans developed massive reinforced concrete blockhouses , some more than six stories high , which were known as Hochbunker " High Bunkers " or " Flaktürme " flak towers , on which they placed anti-aircraft artillery . Those in cities attacked by the Allied land forces became fortresses . Several in Berlin were some of the last buildings to fall to the Soviets during the Battle of Berlin in 1945 . The British built structures such as the Maunsell Forts in the North Sea , the Thames Estuary and other tidal areas upon which they based guns . After the war most were left to rot . Some were outside territorial waters , and had a second life in the 1960s as platforms for pirate radio stations .
The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue to clubs that are relegated from the league in the form of " parachute payments " . Starting with the 2013–14 season , these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons . Though designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues ( the average Premier League team receives £55 million while the average Football League Championship club receives £2 million ) , critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not , leading to the common occurrence of teams " bouncing back " soon after their relegation . For some clubs who have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League , financial problems , including in some cases administration or even liquidation have followed . Further relegations down the footballing ladder have ensued for several clubs unable to cope with the gap .
On the eastern front , progress was very slow . The Russian army was heavily dependent upon its main magazines in Poland , and the Prussian army launched several successful raids against them . One of them , led by general Platen in September resulted in the loss of 2,000 Russians , mostly captured , and the destruction of 5,000 wagons . Deprived of men , the Prussians had to resort to this new sort of warfare , raiding , to delay the advance of their enemies . Nonetheless , at the end of the year , they suffered two critical setbacks . The Russians under Zakhar Chernyshev and Pyotr Rumyantsev stormed Kolberg in Pomerania , while the Austrians captured Schweidnitz . The loss of Kolberg cost Prussia its last port on the Baltic Sea . In Britain , it was speculated that a total Prussian collapse was now imminent .
During the late 1980s and early 1990s , Richmond experienced a spike in overall crime , in particular , the city 's murder rate . The city had 93 murders for the year of 1985 , with a murder rate of 41.9 killings committed per 100,000 residents . Over the next decade , the city saw a major increase in total homicides . In 1990 there were 114 murders , for a murder rate of 56.1 killings per 100,000 residents . There were 120 murders in 1995 , resulting in a murder rate of 59.1 killings per 100,000 residents , one of the highest in the United States .
With too low a bit rate , compression artifacts ( i.e. , sounds that were not present in the original recording ) may be audible in the reproduction . Some audio is hard to compress because of its randomness and sharp attacks . When this type of audio is compressed , artifacts such as ringing or pre-echo are usually heard . A sample of applause compressed with a relatively low bit rate provides a good example of compression artifacts .
A large Russian assault on the allied supply base to the southeast , at Balaclava was rebuffed on 25 October 1854.:521–527 The Battle of Balaclava is remembered in the UK for the actions of two British units . At the start of the battle , a large body of Russian cavalry charged the 93rd Highlanders , who were posted north of the village of Kadikoi . Commanding them was Sir Colin Campbell . Rather than 'form square ' , the traditional method of repelling cavalry , Campbell took the risky decision to have his Highlanders form a single line , two men deep . Campbell had seen the effectiveness of the new Minie rifles , with which his troops were armed , at the Battle of the Alma a month before , and was confident his men could beat back the Russians . His tactics succeeded . From up on the ridge to the west , Times correspondent William Howard Russell saw the Highlanders as a 'thin red streak topped with steel ' , a phrase which soon became the 'Thin Red Line . '
Traditionally , Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona 's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority , in stark contrast to Barça 's revolutionary spirit . Also in the 1960s and 1970s , while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia 's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life , Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen , military officers , civil servants and career fascists .
CDs are susceptible to damage during handling and from environmental exposure . Pits are much closer to the label side of a disc , enabling defects and contaminants on the clear side to be out of focus during playback . Consequently , CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disc . Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing . The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed , allowing gases and liquids to corrode the metal reflective layer and to interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits . The fungus Geotrichum candidum , found in Belize , has been found to consume the polycarbonate plastic and aluminium found in CDs .
The passing of the Antarctic Conservation Act ( 1978 ) in the U.S. brought several restrictions to U.S. activity on Antarctica . The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty , as can the extraction of any indigenous species . The overfishing of krill , which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem , led officials to enact regulations on fishing . The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources ( CCAMLR ) , a treaty that came into force in 1980 , requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem . Despite these new acts , unregulated and illegal fishing , particularly of Patagonian toothfish ( marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S. ) , remains a serious problem . The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing , with estimates of 32,000 tonnes ( 35,300 short tons ) in 2000 .
Beer is the world 's most widely consumed and likely the oldest alcoholic beverage ; it is the third most popular drink overall , after water and tea . The production of beer is called brewing , which involves the fermentation of starches , mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly malted barley , although wheat , maize ( corn ) , and rice are widely used . Most beer is flavoured with hops , which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative , though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included . The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect which is often removed during processing , and replaced with forced carbonation . Some of humanity 's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer : the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours , and " The Hymn to Ninkasi " , a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer , served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people .
Muslim physicians contributed to the field of medicine , including the subjects of anatomy and physiology : such as in the 15th century Persian work by Mansur ibn Muhammad ibn al-Faqih Ilyas entitled Tashrih al-badan ( Anatomy of the body ) which contained comprehensive diagrams of the body 's structural , nervous and circulatory systems ; or in the work of the Egyptian physician Ibn al-Nafis , who proposed the theory of pulmonary circulation . Avicenna 's The Canon of Medicine remained an authoritative medical textbook in Europe until the 18th century . Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi ( also known as Abulcasis ) contributed to the discipline of medical surgery with his Kitab al-Tasrif ( " Book of Concessions " ) , a medical encyclopedia which was later translated to Latin and used in European and Muslim medical schools for centuries . Other medical advancements came in the fields of pharmacology and pharmacy .
The BBC 's highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights , as well as other evenings when fixtures justify , will run until 2016 . Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 have been purchased for £1.782 billion . On 22 June 2009 , due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £30 million payment to the Premier League , ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing a total of 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010–11 to 2012–13 . On 13 June 2012 , the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013–14 through 2015–16 seasons at £246 million-a-year . The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky who paid £760 million-a-year . The total domestic rights have raised £3.018 billion , an increase of 70.2 % over the 2010–11 to 2012–13 rights . The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2 % in 2015 , when Sky and BT paid a total of £5.136 billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018–19 season .
On August 17 , 2007 , Dell Inc. announced that after an internal investigation into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through to the first quarter of 2007 by a total amount of between $ 50 million and $ 150 million , or 2 cents to 7 cents per share . The investigation , begun in November 2006 , resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted . It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer AMD . In 2010 Dell finally paid $ 100 million to settle the SEC 's charges of fraud . Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions , without admitting or denying the charges .
There is evidence of induced copper deficiency in those taking 100–300 mg of zinc daily . A 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo . The USDA RDA is 11 and 8 mg Zn/day for men and women , respectively . Levels of 100–300 mg may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol . Levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals , such as iron and manganese . There is also a condition called the zinc shakes or " zinc chills " that can be induced by the inhalation of freshly formed zinc oxide formed during the welding of galvanized materials . Zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain between 17 and 38 mg of zinc per gram . There have been claims of disability , and even death , due to excessive use of these products .
Experts point out that the earthquake hit an area that has been largely neglected and untouched by China 's economic rise . Health care is poor in inland areas such as Sichuan , highlighting the widening gap between prosperous urban dwellers and struggling rural people . Vice Minister of Health Gao Qiang told reporters in Beijing that the " public health care system in China is insufficient . " The Vice Minister of Health also suggested that the government would pick up the costs of care to earthquake victims , many of whom have little or no insurance : " The government should be responsible for providing medical treatment to them , " he said .
The Polish nobility enjoyed many rights that were not available to the noble classes of other countries and , typically , each new monarch conceded them further privileges . Those privileges became the basis of the Golden Liberty in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth . Despite having a king , Poland was called the nobility 's Commonwealth because the king was elected by all interested members of hereditary nobility and Poland was considered to be the property of this class , not of the king or the ruling dynasty . This state of affairs grew up in part because of the extinction of the male-line descendants of the old royal dynasty ( first the Piasts , then the Jagiellons ) , and the selection by the nobility of the Polish king from among the dynasty 's female-line descendants .
Greece is home to the first advanced civilizations in Europe and is considered the birthplace of Western civilization , [ citation clutter ] beginning with the Cycladic civilization on the islands of the Aegean Sea at around 3200 BC , the Minoan civilization in Crete ( 2700–1500 BC ) , and then the Mycenaean civilization on the mainland ( 1900–1100 BC ) . These civilizations possessed writing , the Minoans writing in an undeciphered script known as Linear A , and the Mycenaeans in Linear B , an early form of Greek . The Mycenaeans gradually absorbed the Minoans , but collapsed violently around 1200 BC , during a time of regional upheaval known as the Bronze Age collapse . This ushered in a period known as the Greek Dark Ages , from which written records are absent .
The site where the Saint Petersburg Passage sprawls had been devoted to trade since the city 's foundation in the early 18th century . It had been occupied by various shops and warehouses ( Maly Gostiny Dvor , Schukin Dvor , Apraksin Dvor ) until 1846 , when Count Essen-Stenbock-Fermor acquired the grounds to build an elite shopping mall for the Russian nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie . Stenbock-Fermor conceived of the Passage as more than a mere shopping mall , but also as a cultural and social centre for the people of St Petersburg . The edifice contained coffee-houses , confectioneries , panorama installations , an anatomical museum , a wax museum , and even a small zoo , described by Dostoyevsky in his extravaganza " Crocodile , or Passage through the Passage " . The concert hall became renowned as a setting for literary readings attended by the likes of Dostoevsky and Turgenev . Parenthetically , the Passage premises have long been associated with the entertainment industry and still remains home to the Komissarzhevskaya Theatre .
This allowed any English firm to trade with India , unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament , thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years . By an act that was passed in 1698 , a new " parallel " East India Company ( officially titled the English Company Trading to the East Indies ) was floated under a state-backed indemnity of £2 million . The powerful stockholders of the old company quickly subscribed a sum of £315,000 in the new concern , and dominated the new body . The two companies wrestled with each other for some time , both in England and in India , for a dominant share of the trade .
The Raleigh Parks and Recreation Department offers a wide variety of leisure opportunities at more than 150 sites throughout the city , which include : 8,100 acres ( 33 km2 ) of park land , 78 miles ( 126 km ) of greenway , 22 community centers , a BMX championship-caliber race track , 112 tennis courts among 25 locations , 5 public lakes , and 8 public aquatic facilities . The J. C. Raulston Arboretum , an 8-acre ( 32,000 m² ) arboretum and botanical garden in west Raleigh administered by North Carolina State University , maintains a year-round collection that is open daily to the public without charge .
Medieval writers divided history into periods such as the " Six Ages " or the " Four Empires " , and considered their time to be the last before the end of the world . When referring to their own times , they spoke of them as being " modern " . In the 1330s , the humanist and poet Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua ( or " ancient " ) and to the Christian period as nova ( or " new " ) . Leonardo Bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodisation in his History of the Florentine People ( 1442 ) . Bruni and later historians argued that Italy had recovered since Petrarch 's time , and therefore added a third period to Petrarch 's two . The " Middle Ages " first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas or " middle season " . In early usage , there were many variants , including medium aevum , or " middle age " , first recorded in 1604 , and media saecula , or " middle ages " , first recorded in 1625 . The alternative term " medieval " ( or occasionally " mediaeval " ) derives from medium aevum . Tripartite periodisation became standard after the German 17th century historian Christoph Cellarius divided history into three periods : Ancient , Medieval , and Modern .

Notable Greek scientists of modern times include Dimitrios Galanos , Georgios Papanikolaou ( inventor of the Pap test ) , Nicholas Negroponte , Constantin Carathéodory ( known for the Carathéodory theorems and Carathéodory conjecture ) , Manolis Andronikos ( discovered the tomb of Philip II of Macedon in Vergina ) , Michael Dertouzos , John Argyris , Panagiotis Kondylis , John Iliopoulos ( 2007 Dirac Prize for his contributions on the physics of the charm quark , a major contribution to the birth of the Standard Model , the modern theory of Elementary Particles ) , Joseph Sifakis ( 2007 Turing Award , the " Nobel Prize " of Computer Science ) , Christos Papadimitriou ( 2002 Knuth Prize , 2012 Gödel Prize ) , Mihalis Yannakakis ( 2005 Knuth Prize ) , Dimitri Nanopoulos and Helene Ahrweiler .
It has pleased western historians to write of a decline of the Ottoman Empire as though a stable and uncontested polity of that name once existed . The borders did expand and contract but they were always dynamic and always in " question " right from the beginning . The Ottoman Empire was created from the lands of the former eastern Roman Empire on the occasion of the latter 's violent demise . The last Roman emperor died fighting hand-to-hand in the streets of his capital , Constantinople , overwhelmed by the Ottoman military , in May , 1453 . The victors inherited his remaining territory in the Balkans .
Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837 , and a regency was avoided . On 20 June 1837 , William IV died at the age of 71 , and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom . In her diary she wrote , " I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma , who told me the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see me . I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room ( only in my dressing gown ) and alone , and saw them . Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle , the King , was no more , and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning , and consequently that I am Queen . " Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria , but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again .

The Cork College of Commerce is the largest post-Leaving Certificate college in Ireland and is also the biggest provider of Vocational Preparation and Training courses in the country . [ citation needed ] Other 3rd level institutions include Griffith College Cork , a private institution , and various other colleges .
The simplest type of MP3 file uses one bit rate for the entire file : this is known as Constant Bit Rate ( CBR ) encoding . Using a constant bit rate makes encoding simpler and faster . However , it is also possible to create files where the bit rate changes throughout the file . These are known as Variable Bit Rate ( VBR ) files . The idea behind this is that , in any piece of audio , some parts will be much easier to compress , such as silence or music containing only a few instruments , while others will be more difficult to compress . So , the overall quality of the file may be increased by using a lower bit rate for the less complex passages and a higher one for the more complex parts . With some encoders , it is possible to specify a given quality , and the encoder will vary the bit rate accordingly . Users who know a particular " quality setting " that is transparent to their ears can use this value when encoding all of their music , and generally speaking not need to worry about performing personal listening tests on each piece of music to determine the correct bit rate .
The climate in Southeast Asia is mainly tropical–hot and humid all year round with plentiful rainfall . Northern Vietnam and the Myanmar Himalayas are the only regions in Southeast Asia that feature a subtropical climate , which has a cold winter with snow . The majority of Southeast Asia has a wet and dry season caused by seasonal shift in winds or monsoon . The tropical rain belt causes additional rainfall during the monsoon season . The rain forest is the second largest on earth ( with the Amazon being the largest ) . An exception to this type of climate and vegetation is the mountain areas in the northern region , where high altitudes lead to milder temperatures and drier landscape . Other parts fall out of this climate because they are desert like .
Western commentators post-9/11 often perceive madaris as places of radical revivalism with a connotation of anti-Americanism and radical extremism , frequently associated in the Western press with Wahhabi attitudes toward non-Muslims . In Arabic the word madrasa simply means " school " and does not imply a political or religious affiliation , radical or otherwise . Madaris have varied curricula , and are not all religious . Some madaris in India , for example , have a secularised identity . Although early madaris were founded primarily to gain " knowledge of God " they also taught subjects such as mathematics and poetry . For example , in the Ottoman Empire , " Madrasahs had seven categories of sciences that were taught , such as : styles of writing , oral sciences like the Arabic language , grammar , rhetoric , and history and intellectual sciences , such as logic . " This is similar to the Western world , in which universities began as institutions of the Catholic church .
On 26 February 2012 , The Sun on Sunday was launched to replace the closed News of the World , employing some of its former journalists . In late 2013 , it was given a new look , with a new typeface . The average circulation for The Sun on Sunday in March 2014 was 1,686,840 ; but in May 2015 The Mail on Sunday sold more copies for the first time , an average of 28,650 over those of its rival : 1,497,855 to 1,469,195 . Roy Greenslade issued some caveats over the May 2015 figures , but believes the weekday Daily Mail will overtake The Sun in circulation during 2016 .
In 2004 , the first bike lane in the city was added to Orange Street , connecting East Rock Park and the East Rock neighborhood to downtown . Since then , bike lanes have also been added to sections of Howard Ave , Elm St , Dixwell Avenue , Water Street , Clinton Avenue and State Street . The city has created recommended bike routes for getting around New Haven , including use of the Canal Trail and the Orange Street lane . A bike map of the city entire can be seen here , and bike maps broken down by area here . As of the end of 2012 , bicycle lanes have also been added in both directions on Dixwell Avenue along most of the street from downtown to the Hamden town line , as well as along Howard Avenue from Yale New Haven Hospital to City Point .
The main cast was revealed in December 2014 at the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios . Daniel Craig returned for his fourth appearance as James Bond , while Ralph Fiennes , Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw reprised their roles as M , Eve Moneypenny and Q respectively , having been established in Skyfall . Rory Kinnear also reprised his role as Bill Tanner in his third appearance in the series .
Prior to moving its headquarters to Chicago , aerospace manufacturer Boeing ( # 30 ) was the largest company based in Seattle . Its largest division is still headquartered in nearby Renton , and the company has large aircraft manufacturing plants in Everett and Renton , so it remains the largest private employer in the Seattle metropolitan area . Former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels announced a desire to spark a new economic boom driven by the biotechnology industry in 2006 . Major redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood is underway , in an effort to attract new and established biotech companies to the city , joining biotech companies Corixa ( acquired by GlaxoSmithKline ) , Immunex ( now part of Amgen ) , Trubion , and ZymoGenetics . Vulcan Inc. , the holding company of billionaire Paul Allen , is behind most of the development projects in the region . While some see the new development as an economic boon , others have criticized Nickels and the Seattle City Council for pandering to Allen 's interests at taxpayers ' expense . Also in 2006 , Expansion Magazine ranked Seattle among the top 10 metropolitan areas in the nation for climates favorable to business expansion . In 2005 , Forbes ranked Seattle as the most expensive American city for buying a house based on the local income levels . In 2013 , however , the magazine ranked Seattle No . 9 on its list of the Best Places for Business and Careers .
Josip Broz Tito ( Cyrillic : Јосип Броз Тито , pronounced [ jǒsip brôːz tîto ] ; born Josip Broz ; 7 May 1892 [ nb 1 ] – 4 May 1980 ) was a Yugoslav revolutionary and statesman , serving in various roles from 1943 until his death in 1980 . During World War II he was the leader of the Partisans , often regarded as the most effective resistance movement in occupied Europe . While his presidency has been criticized as authoritarian , and concerns about the repression of political opponents have been raised , Tito was " seen by most as a benevolent dictator " due to his economic and diplomatic policies . He was a popular public figure both in Yugoslavia and abroad . Viewed as a unifying symbol , his internal policies maintained the peaceful coexistence of the nations of the Yugoslav federation . He gained further international attention as the chief leader of the Non-Aligned Movement , working with Jawaharlal Nehru of India , Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Sukarno of Indonesia .
Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values . In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar ( symbol ₥ ) , cent or one-hundredth of a dollar ( symbol ¢ ) , dime or one-tenth of a dollar , and eagle or ten dollars , with prescribed weights and composition of gold , silver , or copper for each . It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union , but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $ 50 half union exist . However , only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar ; " dime " is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10¢ , while " eagle " and " mill " are largely unknown to the general public , though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies , and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $ X.XX9 per gallon , e.g. , $ 3.599 , sometimes written as $ 3.599⁄10 . When currently issued in circulating form , denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes ( with the exception of gold , silver and platinum coins valued up to $ 100 as legal tender , but worth far more as bullion ) . Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today , although the note form is significantly more common . In the past , " paper money " was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar ( fractional currency ) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $ 20 ( known as the " double eagle " , discontinued in the 1930s ) . The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars , and subsequently was used in naming gold coins . Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination , known as " fractional currency " , was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as " shinplasters " . In 1854 , James Guthrie , then Secretary of the Treasury , proposed creating $ 100 , $ 50 and $ 25 gold coins , which were referred to as a " Union " , " Half Union " , and " Quarter Union " , thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $ 100 .
Plymouth was granted the dignity of Lord Mayor by King George V in 1935 . The position is elected each year by a group of six councillors . It is traditional that the position of the Lord Mayor alternates between the Conservative Party and the Labour Party annually and that the Lord Mayor chooses the Deputy Lord Mayor . Conservative councillor Dr John Mahony is the incumbent for 2015–16 .
Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis , anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions . Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material , such as the Paleolithic and the Neolithic , of particular use in archaeology . [ citation needed ] Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types , such as Olduwan or Mousterian or Levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past . [ citation needed ] Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to Culture regions as well , since mapping cultures is central to both sciences . By making comparisons across cultural traditions ( time-based ) and cultural regions ( space-based ) , anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method , a central part of their science .
The Qing dynasty ( 1644–1911 ) was founded after the fall of the Ming , the last Han Chinese dynasty , by the Manchus . The Manchus were formerly known as the Jurchens . When Beijing was captured by Li Zicheng 's peasant rebels in 1644 , the Chongzhen Emperor , the last Ming emperor , committed suicide . The Manchus then allied with former Ming general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing , which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty . The Mancus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of China proper . Schoppa , the editor of The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History argues , " A date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is thus closer to what we know today as historical 'reality ' . It also allows us to have a better baseline to understand the precipitous decline of the Chinese polity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . "
Versions of revived Palladian architecture dominated English country house architecture . Houses were increasingly placed in grand landscaped settings , and large houses were generally made wide and relatively shallow , largely to look more impressive from a distance . The height was usually highest in the centre , and the Baroque emphasis on corner pavilions often found on the continent generally avoided . In grand houses , an entrance hall led to steps up to a piano nobile or mezzanine floor where the main reception rooms were . Typically the basement area or " rustic " , with kitchens , offices and service areas , as well as male guests with muddy boots , came some way above ground , and was lit by windows that were high on the inside , but just above ground level outside . A single block was typical , with a perhaps a small court for carriages at the front marked off by railings and a gate , but rarely a stone gatehouse , or side wings around the court .
Robert Plutchik agreed with Ekman 's biologically driven perspective but developed the " wheel of emotions " , suggesting eight primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis : joy versus sadness ; anger versus fear ; trust versus disgust ; and surprise versus anticipation . Some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions . The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions . Alternatively , similar to the way primary colors combine , primary emotions could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience . For example , interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form contempt . Relationships exist between basic emotions , resulting in positive or negative influences .
The British Architectural Library , sometimes referred to as the RIBA Library , was established in 1834 upon the founding of the institute with donations from members . Now , with over four million items , it is one of the three largest architectural libraries in the world and the largest in Europe . Some items from the collections are on permanent display at the Victoria and Albert Museum ( V & A ) in the V & A + RIBA Architecture Gallery and included in temporary exhibitions at the RIBA and across Europe and North America . Its collections include :
The Tuvaluan language and English are the national languages of Tuvalu . Tuvaluan is of the Ellicean group of Polynesian languages , distantly related to all other Polynesian languages such as Hawaiian , Māori , Tahitian , Samoan and Tongan . It is most closely related to the languages spoken on the Polynesian outliers in Micronesia and northern and central Melanesia . The language has borrowed from the Samoan language , as a consequence of Christian missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries being predominantly Samoan .
There is very little voice acting in the game , as is the case in most Zelda titles to date . Link remains silent in conversation , but grunts when attacking or injured and gasps when surprised . His emotions and responses are largely indicated visually by nods and facial expressions . Other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations , including laughter , surprised or fearful exclamations , and screams . The character of Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialog is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech , which was produced by scrambling the phonemes of English phrases [ better source needed ] sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto .
Temporal measurement , chronometry , takes two distinct period forms : the calendar , a mathematical tool for organizing intervals of time , and the clock , a physical mechanism that counts the passage of time . In day-to-day life , the clock is consulted for periods less than a day whereas the calendar is consulted for periods longer than a day . Increasingly , personal electronic devices display both calendars and clocks simultaneously . The number ( as on a clock dial or calendar ) that marks the occurrence of a specified event as to hour or date is obtained by counting from a fiducial epoch—a central reference point .
220th Street is the highest numbered street on Manhattan Island . Marble Hill is also within the borough of Manhattan , so the highest street number in the borough is 228th Street . However , the numbering continues in the Bronx up to 263rd Street . The lowest number is East First Street—which runs in Alphabet City near East Houston Street—as well as First Place in Battery Park City .
Israeli literature is primarily poetry and prose written in Hebrew , as part of the renaissance of Hebrew as a spoken language since the mid-19th century , although a small body of literature is published in other languages , such as English . By law , two copies of all printed matter published in Israel must be deposited in the National Library of Israel at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem . In 2001 , the law was amended to include audio and video recordings , and other non-print media . In 2013 , 91 percent of the 7,863 books transferred to the library were in Hebrew . The Hebrew Book Week is held each June and features book fairs , public readings , and appearances by Israeli authors around the country . During the week , Israel 's top literary award , the Sapir Prize , is presented . [ citation needed ]
Several explanations have been offered for Yale’s representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War . Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s , and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates . Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale’s focus on creating " a laboratory for future leaders , " an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster . Richard H. Brodhead , former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University , stated : " We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions , and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale . " Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes " an ethos of organized activity " at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union 's Liberal Party , George Pataki the Conservative Party , and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News . Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism : " It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school . " CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the " son and grandson of alumni " , and for a " member of a politically influential family . " New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students , faculty , and administration , which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others .
The first BeiDou system , officially called the BeiDou Satellite Navigation Experimental System ( simplified Chinese : 北斗卫星导航试验系统 ; traditional Chinese : 北斗衛星導航試驗系統 ; pinyin : Běidǒu wèixīng dǎoháng shìyàn xìtǒng ) and also known as BeiDou-1 , consists of three satellites and offers limited coverage and applications . It has been offering navigation services , mainly for customers in China and neighboring regions , since 2000 .
The Negritos are believed to be the first inhabitants of Southeast Asia . Once inhabiting Taiwan , Vietnam , and various other parts of Asia , they are now confined primarily to Thailand , the Malay Archipelago , and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . Negrito means " little black people " in Spanish ( negrito is the Spanish diminutive of negro , i.e. , " little black person " ) ; it is what the Spaniards called the short-statured , hunter-gatherer autochthones that they encountered in the Philippines . Despite this , Negritos are never referred to as black today , and doing so would cause offense . The term Negrito itself has come under criticism in countries like Malaysia , where it is now interchangeable with the more acceptable Semang , although this term actually refers to a specific group . The common Thai word for Negritos literally means " frizzy hair " .
Albert spent the first six months of 1913 on the training ship HMS Cumberland in the West Indies and on the east coast of Canada . He was rated as a midshipman aboard HMS Collingwood on 15 September 1913 , and spent three months in the Mediterranean . His fellow officers gave him the nickname " Mr. Johnson " . One year after his commission , he began service in the First World War . He was mentioned in despatches for his action as a turret officer aboard Collingwood in the Battle of Jutland ( 31 May – 1 June 1916 ) , an indecisive engagement with the German navy that was the largest naval action of the war . He did not see further combat , largely because of ill health caused by a duodenal ulcer , for which he had an operation in November 1917 .
In 1661 another Jesuit , Johann Grueber , crossed Tibet from Sining to Lhasa ( where he spent a month ) , before heading on to Nepal . He was followed by others who actually built a church in Lhasa . These included the Jesuit Father Ippolito Desideri , 1716–1721 , who gained a deep knowledge of Tibetan culture , language and Buddhism , and various Capuchins in 1707–1711 , 1716–1733 and 1741–1745 , Christianity was used by some Tibetan monarchs and their courts and the Karmapa sect lamas to counterbalance the influence of the Gelugpa sect in the 17th century until in 1745 when all the missionaries were expelled at the lama 's insistence .
The first PCBs used through-hole technology , mounting electronic components by leads inserted through holes on one side of the board and soldered onto copper traces on the other side . Boards may be single-sided , with an unplated component side , or more compact double-sided boards , with components soldered on both sides . Horizontal installation of through-hole parts with two axial leads ( such as resistors , capacitors , and diodes ) is done by bending the leads 90 degrees in the same direction , inserting the part in the board ( often bending leads located on the back of the board in opposite directions to improve the part 's mechanical strength ) , soldering the leads , and trimming off the ends . Leads may be soldered either manually or by a wave soldering machine .
As of 2007 , the total installed capacity of solar hot water systems is approximately 154 thermal gigawatt ( GWth ) . China is the world leader in their deployment with 70 GWth installed as of 2006 and a long-term goal of 210 GWth by 2020 . Israel and Cyprus are the per capita leaders in the use of solar hot water systems with over 90 % of homes using them . In the United States , Canada and Australia heating swimming pools is the dominant application of solar hot water with an installed capacity of 18 GWth as of 2005 .
The decorations were seldom displayed , however . After the Tito–Stalin split of 1948 and his inauguration as president in 1953 , Tito rarely wore his uniform except when present in a military function , and then ( with rare exception ) only wore his Yugoslav ribbons for obvious practical reasons . The awards were displayed in full number only at his funeral in 1980 . Tito 's reputation as one of the Allied leaders of World War II , along with his diplomatic position as the founder of the Non-Aligned Movement , was primarily the cause of the favorable international recognition .
The earliest writers on sexual orientation usually understood it to be intrinsically linked to the subject 's own sex . For example , it was thought that a typical female-bodied person who is attracted to female-bodied persons would have masculine attributes , and vice versa . This understanding was shared by most of the significant theorists of sexual orientation from the mid nineteenth to early twentieth century , such as Karl Heinrich Ulrichs , Richard von Krafft-Ebing , Magnus Hirschfeld , Havelock Ellis , Carl Jung , and Sigmund Freud , as well as many gender-variant homosexual people themselves . However , this understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was disputed at the time , and , through the second half of the twentieth century , gender identity came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation . Transgender and cisgender people may be attracted to men , women , or both , although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations . An individual homosexual , heterosexual or bisexual person may be masculine , feminine , or androgynous , and in addition , many members and supporters of lesbian and gay communities now see the " gender-conforming heterosexual " and the " gender-nonconforming homosexual " as negative stereotypes . Nevertheless , studies by J. Michael Bailey and Kenneth Zucker found a majority of the gay men and lesbians sampled reporting various degrees of gender-nonconformity during their childhood years .
As an adolescent , he had a particular love of theology and the Scriptures became the foundation of his spirituality . During his studies in Palencia , Spain , he experienced a dreadful famine , prompting Dominic to sell all of his beloved books and other equipment to help his neighbors . After he completed his studies , Bishop Martin Bazan and Prior Diego d'Achebes appointed Dominic to the cathedral chapter and he became a regular canon under the Rule of St. Augustine and the Constitutions for the cathedral church of Osma . At the age of twenty-four or twenty-five , he was ordained to the priesthood .
With crude oil as the country 's primary export , Gaddafi sought to improve Libya 's oil sector . In October 1969 , he proclaimed the current trade terms unfair , benefiting foreign corporations more than the Libyan state , and by threatening to reduce production , in December Jalloud successfully increased the price of Libyan oil . In 1970 , other OPEC states followed suit , leading to a global increase in the price of crude oil . The RCC followed with the Tripoli Agreement , in which they secured income tax , back-payments and better pricing from the oil corporations ; these measures brought Libya an estimated $ 1 billion in additional revenues in its first year .
The most widely used symbol is the flag of Greece , which features nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white representing the nine syllables of the Greek national motto Eleftheria i thanatos ( freedom or death ) , which was the motto of the Greek War of Independence . The blue square in the upper hoist-side corner bears a white cross , which represents Greek Orthodoxy . The Greek flag is widely used by the Greek Cypriots , although Cyprus has officially adopted a neutral flag to ease ethnic tensions with the Turkish Cypriot minority – see flag of Cyprus ) .
Three main parades take place during Carnival . The first is held on the first day , during which the " Carnival King " ( either a person in costume or an effigy ) rides through the city on his carriage . The second is held on the first Sunday of the festival and the participants are mainly children . The third and largest takes place on the last day of Carnival and involves hundreds of people walking in costume along the town 's longest avenue . The latter two parades are open to anyone who wishes to participate .
Eton 's best-known holiday takes place on the so-called " Fourth of June " , a celebration of the birthday of King George III , Eton 's greatest patron . This day is celebrated with the Procession of Boats , in which the top rowing crews from the top four years row past in vintage wooden rowing boats . Similar to the Queen 's Official Birthday , the " Fourth of June " is no longer celebrated on 4 June , but on the Wednesday before the first weekend of June . Eton also observes St. Andrew 's Day , on which the Eton wall game is played . [ citation needed ]
The bacterial cell is surrounded by a cell membrane ( also known as a lipid , cytoplasmic or plasma membrane ) . This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients , proteins and other essential components of the cytoplasm within the cell . As they are prokaryotes , bacteria do not usually have membrane-bound organelles in their cytoplasm , and thus contain few large intracellular structures . They lack a true nucleus , mitochondria , chloroplasts and the other organelles present in eukaryotic cells . Bacteria were once seen as simple bags of cytoplasm , but structures such as the prokaryotic cytoskeleton and the localization of proteins to specific locations within the cytoplasm that give bacteria some complexity have been discovered . These subcellular levels of organization have been called " bacterial hyperstructures " .
Having removed the monarchical government , Gaddafi proclaimed the foundation of the Libyan Arab Republic . Addressing the populace by radio , he proclaimed an end to the " reactionary and corrupt " regime , " the stench of which has sickened and horrified us all . " Due to the coup 's bloodless nature , it was initially labelled the " White Revolution " , although was later renamed the " One September Revolution " after the date on which it occurred . Gaddafi insisted that the Free Officers ' coup represented a revolution , marking the start of widespread change in the socio-economic and political nature of Libya . He proclaimed that the revolution meant " freedom , socialism , and unity " , and over the coming years implemented measures to achieve this .
Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century , and have together with vaccination led to the near eradication of diseases such as tuberculosis in the developed world . Their effectiveness and easy access led to overuse , especially in livestock raising , prompting bacteria to develop resistance . This has led to widespread problems with antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance , so much as to prompt the World Health Organization to classify antimicrobial resistance as a " serious threat [ that ] is no longer a prediction for the future , it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone , of any age , in any country " .
The modern Slavic peoples carry a variety of mitochondrial DNA haplogroups and Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups . Yet two paternal haplogroups predominate : R1a1a [ M17 ] and I2a2a [ L69.2=T/S163.2 ] . The frequency of Haplogroup R1a ranges from 63.39 % in the Sorbs , through 56.4 % in Poland , 54 % in Ukraine , 52 % in Russia , Belarus , to 15.2 % in Republic of Macedonia , 14.7 % in Bulgaria and 12.1 % in Herzegovina . The correlation between R1a1a [ M17 ] and the speakers of Indo-European languages , particularly those of Eastern Europe ( Russian ) and Central and Southern Asia , was noticed in the late 1990s . From this Spencer Wells and colleagues , following the Kurgan hypothesis , deduced that R1a1a arose on the Pontic-Caspian steppe .
Suffering ( Pāli : दुक्ख dukkha ; Sanskrit दुःख duḥkha ) is also a central concept in Buddhism . The word roughly corresponds to a number of terms in English including suffering , pain , unsatisfactoriness , sorrow , affliction , anxiety , dissatisfaction , discomfort , anguish , stress , misery , and frustration . Although the term is often translated as " suffering " , its philosophical meaning is more analogous to " disquietude " as in the condition of being disturbed . As such , " suffering " is too narrow a translation with " negative emotional connotations " [ web 9 ] that can give the impression that the Buddhist view is pessimistic , but Buddhism seeks to be neither pessimistic nor optimistic , but realistic . In English-language Buddhist literature translated from Pāli , " dukkha " is often left untranslated , so as to encompass its full range of meaning . [ note 8 ]
Less than 1 % of all species that have been described have been studied beyond simply noting their existence . The vast majority of Earth 's species are microbial . Contemporary biodiversity physics is " firmly fixated on the visible [ macroscopic ] world " . For example , microbial life is metabolically and environmentally more diverse than multicellular life ( see e.g. , extremophile ) . " On the tree of life , based on analyses of small-subunit ribosomal RNA , visible life consists of barely noticeable twigs . The inverse relationship of size and population recurs higher on the evolutionary ladder— " to a first approximation , all multicellular species on Earth are insects " . Insect extinction rates are high—supporting the Holocene extinction hypothesis .
Among Richmond 's most interesting architectural features is its Cast-iron architecture . Second only to New Orleans in its concentration of cast iron work , the city is home to a unique collection of cast iron porches , balconies , fences , and finials . Richmond 's position as a center of iron production helped to fuel its popularity within the city . At the height of production in the 1890 , 25 foundries operated in the city employing nearly 3,500 metal workers . This number is seven times the number of general construction workers being employed in Richmond at the time which illustrates the importance of its iron exports . Porches and fences in urban neighborhoods such as Jackson Ward , Church Hill , and Monroe Ward are particularly elaborate , often featuring ornate iron casts never replicated outside of Richmond . In some cases cast were made for a single residential or commercial application .
During the early High Middle Ages , Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty , which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period . In 1024 , they were replaced by the Salian dynasty , who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV ( r. 1084–1105 ) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy . His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility . A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V ( r. 1111–25 ) , who died without heirs , until Frederick I Barbarossa ( r. 1155–90 ) took the imperial throne . Although he ruled effectively , the basic problems remained , and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century . Barbarossa 's grandson Frederick II ( r. 1220–1250 ) , who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother , clashed repeatedly with the papacy . His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy . He and his successors faced many difficulties , including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century . Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus ' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241 , 1259 , and 1287 .
In July 2012 a United Nations Special Rapporteur called on the Tuvalu Government to develop a national water strategy to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation . In 2012 , Tuvalu developed a National Water Resources Policy under the Integrated Water Resource Management ( IWRM ) Project and the Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change ( PACC ) Project , which are sponsored by the Global Environment Fund/SOPAC . Government water planning has established a target of between 50 and 100L of water per person per day accounting for drinking water , cleaning , community and cultural activities .
In 1785 , the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York the national capital shortly after the war . New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States . In 1789 , the first President of the United States , George Washington , was inaugurated ; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time , and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted , all at Federal Hall on Wall Street . By 1790 , New York had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States .
In 1939 , coinciding with the start of World War II , Rene Dubos reported the discovery of the first naturally derived antibiotic , tyrothricin , a compound of 20 % gramicidin and 80 % tyrocidine , from B. brevis . It was one of the first commercially manufactured antibiotics universally and was very effective in treating wounds and ulcers during World War II . Gramicidin , however , could not be used systemically because of toxicity . Tyrocidine also proved too toxic for systemic usage . Research results obtained during that period were not shared between the Axis and the Allied powers during the war .
In 1744 , Burke started at Trinity College Dublin , a Protestant establishment , which up until 1793 , did not permit Catholics to take degrees . In 1747 , he set up a debating society , " Edmund Burke 's Club " , which , in 1770 , merged with TCD 's Historical Club to form the College Historical Society ; it is the oldest undergraduate society in the world . The minutes of the meetings of Burke 's Club remain in the collection of the Historical Society . Burke graduated from Trinity in 1748 . Burke 's father wanted him to read Law , and with this in mind he went to London in 1750 , where he entered the Middle Temple , before soon giving up legal study to travel in Continental Europe . After eschewing the Law , he pursued a livelihood through writing .
Light is the signal by which plants synchronize their internal clocks to their environment and is sensed by a wide variety of photoreceptors . Red and blue light are absorbed through several phytochromes and cryptochromes . One phytochrome , phyA , is the main phytochrome in seedlings grown in the dark but rapidly degrades in light to produce Cry1 . Phytochromes B–E are more stable with phyB , the main phytochrome in seedlings grown in the light . The cryptochrome ( cry ) gene is also a light-sensitive component of the circadian clock and is thought to be involved both as a photoreceptor and as part of the clock 's endogenous pacemaker mechanism . Cryptochromes 1–2 ( involved in blue–UVA ) help to maintain the period length in the clock through a whole range of light conditions .
Brigham Young University 's origin can be traced back to 1862 when a man named Warren Dusenberry started a Provo school in a prominent adobe building called Cluff Hall , which was located in the northeast corner of 200 East and 200 North . On October 16 , 1875 , Brigham Young , then president of the LDS Church , personally purchased the Lewis Building after previously hinting that a school would be built in Draper , Utah in 1867 . Hence , October 16 , 1875 is commonly held as BYU 's founding date . Said Young about his vision : " I hope to see an Academy established in Provo ... at which the children of the Latter-day Saints can receive a good education unmixed with the pernicious atheistic influences that are found in so many of the higher schools of the country . "
If the aircraft are VTOL-capable or helicopters , they do not need to decelerate and hence there is no such need . The arrested-recovery system has used an angled deck since the 1950s because , in case the aircraft does not catch the arresting wire , the short deck allows easier take off by reducing the number of objects between the aircraft and the end of the runway . It also has the advantage of separating the recovery operation area from the launch area . Helicopters and aircraft capable of vertical or short take-off and landing ( V/STOL ) usually recover by coming abreast the carrier on the port side and then using their hover capability to move over the flight deck and land vertically without the need for arresting gear .
Britain had been surprised by the sudden Prussian offensive but now began shipping supplies and ₤670,000 ( equivalent to ₤89.9 million in 2015 ) to its new ally . A combined force of allied German states was organised by the British to protect Hanover from French invasion , under the command of the Duke of Cumberland . The British attempted to persuade the Dutch Republic to join the alliance , but the request was rejected , as the Dutch wished to remain fully neutral . Despite the huge disparity in numbers , the year had been successful for the Prussian-led forces on the continent , in contrast to disappointing British campaigns in North America .
The relationships adolescents have with their peers , family , and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent . As an adolescent 's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances , they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends . This is not harmful ; however , if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations , this is an aspect of peer pressure . Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with . This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions , which also makes this a sensitive period . Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual . These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities , how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality . " The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation . In other words , by comparing one person 's personality characteristics to another 's , we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality ( and , ... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons ) . " This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one’s identity and self-concept , which includes ones personality , and underscores the importance of communication , and thus relationships , in one’s development . In social comparison we use reference groups , with respect to both psychological and identity development . These reference groups are the peers of adolescents . This means that who the teen chooses/accepts as their friends and who they communicate with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore have a huge impact on who they become . Research shows that relationships have the largest affect over the social development of an individual .
A further line in the directive stressed the need to inflict the heaviest losses possible , but also to intensify the air war in order to create the impression an amphibious assault on Britain was planned for 1941 . However , meteorological conditions over Britain were not favourable for flying and prevented an escalation in air operations . Airfields became water-logged and the 18 Kampfgruppen ( bomber groups ) of the Luftwaffe 's Kampfgeschwadern ( bomber wings ) were relocated to Germany for rest and re-equipment .
When Link enters the Twilight Realm , the void that corrupts parts of Hyrule , he transforms into a wolf . [ h ] He is eventually able to transform between his Hylian and wolf forms at will . As a wolf , Link loses the ability to use his sword , shield , or any secondary items ; he instead attacks by biting , and defends primarily by dodging attacks . However , " Wolf Link " gains several key advantages in return—he moves faster than he does as a human ( though riding Epona is still faster ) and digs holes to create new passages and uncover buried items , and has improved senses , including the ability to follow scent trails . [ i ] He also carries Midna , a small imp-like creature who gives him hints , uses an energy field to attack enemies , helps him jump long distances , and eventually allows Link to " warp " to any of several preset locations throughout the overworld . [ j ] Using Link 's wolf senses , the player can see and listen to the wandering spirits of those affected by the Twilight , as well as hunt for enemy ghosts named Poes . [ k ]
Hinduism is actively practiced , particularly in suburban areas of Henrico and Chesterfield . Some 6,000 families of Indian descent resided in the Richmond Region as of 2011 . Hindus are served by several temples and cultural centers . The two most familiar are the Cultural Center of India ( CCI ) located off of Iron Bridge Road in Chesterfield County and the Hindu Center of Virginia in Henrico County which has garnered national fame and awards for being the first LEED certified religious facility in the commonwealth .
In 1846 , the United States went to war against Mexico and sent a naval and land expedition to conquer Alta California . At first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports including San Diego , but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back . Following the successful revolt in Los Angeles , the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846 . Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24 , 1846 , when the Americans recaptured it . For the next several months the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo . Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night . The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out . On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General Stephen W. Kearney were at Warner 's Ranch . Commodore Robert F. Stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain Archibald Gillespie to march north to meet him . Their joint command of 150 men , returning to San Diego , encountered about 93 Californios under Andrés Pico . In the ensuing Battle of San Pasqual , fought in the San Pasqual Valley which is now part of the city of San Diego , the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign . Subsequently a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego , rescuing Kearny 's battered and blockaded command .
Unlike the Baroque style that it replaced , which was mostly used for palaces and churches , and had little representation in the British colonies , simpler Georgian styles were widely used by the upper and middle classes . Perhaps the best remaining house is the pristine Hammond-Harwood House ( 1774 ) in Annapolis , Maryland , designed by the colonial architect William Buckland and modelled on the Villa Pisani at Montagnana , Italy as depicted in Andrea Palladio 's I quattro libri dell'architettura ( " Four Books of Architecture " ) .
Despite conflicts with the rival monarchic Chetnik movement , Tito 's Partisans succeeded in liberating territory , notably the " Republic of Užice " . During this period , Tito held talks with Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović on 19 September and 27 October 1941 . It is said that Tito ordered his forces to assist escaping Jews , and that more than 2,000 Jews fought directly for Tito .
After the American Revolutionary War , the number and proportion of free people of color increased markedly in the North and the South as slaves were freed . Most northern states abolished slavery , sometimes , like New York , in programs of gradual emancipation that took more than two decades to be completed . The last slaves in New York were not freed until 1827 . In connection with the Second Great Awakening , Quaker and Methodist preachers in the South urged slaveholders to free their slaves . Revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves , some by deed and others by will , so that from 1782 to 1810 , the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the South .

The British dealt with range measurement first , when it was realised that range was the key to producing a better fuse setting . This led to the Height/Range Finder ( HRF ) , the first model being the Barr & Stroud UB2 , a 2-metre optical coincident rangefinder mounted on a tripod . It measured the distance to the target and the elevation angle , which together gave the height of the aircraft . These were complex instruments and various other methods were also used . The HRF was soon joined by the Height/Fuse Indicator ( HFI ) , this was marked with elevation angles and height lines overlaid with fuse length curves , using the height reported by the HRF operator , the necessary fuse length could be read off .
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in Egypt increased considerably before the removal of Hosni Mubarak , exceeding $ 6 billion in 2006 , due to economic liberalisation and privatisation measures taken by minister of investment Mahmoud Mohieddin . [ citation needed ] Since the fall of Hosni Mubarak in 2011 , Egypt has experienced a drastic fall in both foreign investment and tourism revenues , followed by a 60 % drop in foreign exchange reserves , a 3 % drop in growth , and a rapid devaluation of the Egyptian pound .
From April 20–23 , 1989 , pre-election meetings were held in Lviv for four consecutive days , drawing crowds of up to 25,000 . The action included an one-hour warning strike at eight local factories and institutions . It was the first labor strike in Lviv since 1944 . On May 3 , a pre-election rally attracted 30,000 in Lviv . On May 7 , The Memorial Society organized a mass meeting at Bykivnia , site of a mass grave of Ukrainian and Polish victims of Stalinist terror . After a march from Kiev to the site , a memorial service was staged .
A combination of urban and suburban development , the West Side is generally defined as the area west of I-10 . Western Tucson encompasses the banks of the Santa Cruz River and the foothills of the Tucson Mountains , and includes the International Wildlife Museum , Sentinel Peak , and the Marriott Starr Pass Resort & Spa , located in the wealthy enclave known as Starr Pass . Moving past the Tucson Mountains , travelers find themselves in the area commonly referred to as " west of " Tucson or " Old West Tucson " . A large undulating plain extending south into the Altar Valley , rural residential development predominates , but here you will also find major attractions including Saguaro National Park West , the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum , and the Old Tucson Studios movie set/theme park .
Contemporary chroniclers were mostly critical of John 's performance as king , and his reign has since been the subject of significant debate and periodic revision by historians from the 16th century onwards . Historian Jim Bradbury has summarised the contemporary historical opinion of John 's positive qualities , observing that John is today usually considered a " hard-working administrator , an able man , an able general " . Nonetheless , modern historians agree that he also had many faults as king , including what historian Ralph Turner describes as " distasteful , even dangerous personality traits " , such as pettiness , spitefulness and cruelty . These negative qualities provided extensive material for fiction writers in the Victorian era , and John remains a recurring character within Western popular culture , primarily as a villain in films and stories depicting the Robin Hood legends .
During the Partitions of Poland from 1772 to 1795 , its members began to lose these legal privileges and social status . From that point until 1918 , the legal status of the nobility was essentially dependent upon the policies of the three partitioning powers : the Russian Empire , the Kingdom of Prussia , and the Habsburg Monarchy . The legal privileges of the szlachta were legally abolished in the Second Polish Republic by the March Constitution of 1921 .
There are a vast range of commodity forms available to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion . The list of goods , services and places available is enormous : from dog perfumes , couture , furniture and housing , to dog groomers , therapists , trainers and caretakers , dog cafes , spas , parks and beaches , and dog hotels , airlines and cemeteries . While dog training as an organized activity can be traced back to the 18th century , in the last decades of the 20th century it became a high profile issue as many normal dog behaviors such as barking , jumping up , digging , rolling in dung , fighting , and urine marking ( which dogs do to establish territory through scent ) , became increasingly incompatible with the new role of a pet dog . Dog training books , classes and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued .
Hydrogen was liquefied for the first time by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention , the vacuum flask . He produced solid hydrogen the next year . Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey , and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford , Mark Oliphant , and Paul Harteck . Heavy water , which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen , was discovered by Urey 's group in 1932 . François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine , an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806 . Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819 . The Döbereiner 's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823 .
Teenage alcohol drug use is currently at an all-time low . Out of a polled body of students , 4.4 % of 8th graders reported having been on at least one occasion been drunk within the previous month ; for 10th graders , the number was 13.7 % , and for 12th graders , 25 % . More drastically , cigarette smoking has become a far less prevalent activity among American middle- and high-school students ; in fact , a greater number of teens now smoke marijuana than smoke cigarettes , with one recent study showing a respective 15.2 % versus 11.7 % of surveyed students . Recent studies have shown that male late adolescents are far more likely to smoke cigarettes rather than females . The study indicated that there was a discernible gender difference in the prevalence of smoking among the students . The finding of the study show that more males than females began smoking when they were in primary and high schools whereas most females started smoking after high school . This may be attributed to recent changing social and political views towards marijuana ; issues such as medicinal use and legalization have tended towards painting the drug in a more positive light than historically , while cigarettes continue to be vilified due to associated health risks .
In May 1970 , the Revolutionary Intellectuals Seminar was held to bring intellectuals in line with the revolution , while that year 's Legislative Review and Amendment united secular and religious law codes , introducing sharia into the legal system . Ruling by decree , the RCC maintained the monarchy 's ban on political parties , in May 1970 banned trade unions , and in 1972 outlawed workers ' strikes and suspended newspapers . In September 1971 , Gaddafi resigned , claiming to be dissatisfied with the pace of reform , but returned to his position within a month . In February 1973 , he resigned again , once more returning the following month .
Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass , mixed-grass , and tallgrass prairie , harbor expansive ecosystems in the state 's central and western portions , although cropland has largely replaced native grasses . Where rainfall is sparse in the western regions of the state , shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems , though pinyon pines , red cedar ( junipers ) , and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the far western reaches of the panhandle . Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare , disjunct species including sugar maple , bigtooth maple , nolina and southern live oak .
Compass-M1 transmits in 3 bands : E2 , E5B , and E6 . In each frequency band two coherent sub-signals have been detected with a phase shift of 90 degrees ( in quadrature ) . These signal components are further referred to as " I " and " Q " . The " I " components have shorter codes and are likely to be intended for the open service . The " Q " components have much longer codes , are more interference resistive , and are probably intended for the restricted service . IQ modulation has been the method in both wired and wireless digital modulation since morsetting carrier signal 100 years ago .
British post-punk entered the 1980s with support from members of the critical community—American critic Greil Marcus characterised " Britain 's postpunk pop avant-garde " in a 1980 Rolling Stone article as " sparked by a tension , humour and sense of paradox plainly unique in present day pop music " —as well as media figures such as BBC DJ John Peel , while several groups , such as PiL and Joy Division , achieved some success in the popular charts . The network of supportive record labels that included Industrial , Fast , E.G. , Mute , Axis/4AD and Glass continued to facilitate a large output of music , by artists such as the Raincoats , Essential Logic , Killing Joke , the Teardrop Explodes , and the Psychedelic Furs .
The West Bank was annexed by Jordan in 1950 , following the Arab rejection of the UN decision to create two states in Palestine . Only Britain recognized this annexation and Jordan has since ceded its claim to the territory to the PLO . The West Bank was occupied by Israel in 1967 during the Six-Day War . The population are mainly Palestinians , including refugees of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War . From their occupation in 1967 until 1993 , the Palestinians living in these territories were under Israeli military administration . Since the Israel–PLO letters of recognition , most of the Palestinian population and cities have been under the internal jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority , and only partial Israeli military control , although Israel has on several occasions redeployed its troops and reinstated full military administration during periods of unrest . In response to increasing attacks as part of the Second Intifada , the Israeli government started to construct the Israeli West Bank barrier . When completed , approximately 13 % of the Barrier will be constructed on the Green Line or in Israel with 87 % inside the West Bank .
In Serbia , the Serbian language is the official one , while both Serbian and Croatian are official in the province of Vojvodina . A large Bosniak minority is present in the southwest region of Sandžak , but the " official recognition " of Bosnian language is moot . Bosnian is an optional course in 1st and 2nd grade of the elementary school , while it is also in official use in the municipality of Novi Pazar . However , its nomenclature is controversial , as there is incentive that it is referred to as " Bosniak " ( bošnjački ) rather than " Bosnian " ( bosanski ) ( see Bosnian language for details ) .
In 1913 , Elmer McCollum discovered the first vitamins , fat-soluble vitamin A , and water-soluble vitamin B ( in 1915 ; now known to be a complex of several water-soluble vitamins ) and named vitamin C as the then-unknown substance preventing scurvy . Lafayette Mendel and Thomas Osborne also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B . In 1919 , Sir Edward Mellanby incorrectly identified rickets as a vitamin A deficiency because he could cure it in dogs with cod liver oil . In 1922 , McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil , but found that it still cured rickets . Also in 1922 , H.M. Evans and L.S . Bishop discover vitamin E as essential for rat pregnancy , originally calling it " food factor X " until 1925 .
The largest mammal to live in the highest altitudes are the alpine ibex , which have been sighted as high as 3,000 m ( 9,843 ft ) . The ibex live in caves and descend to eat the succulent alpine grasses . Classified as antelopes , chamois are smaller than ibex and found throughout the Alps , living above the tree line and are common in the entire alpine range . Areas of the eastern Alps are still home to brown bears . In Switzerland the canton of Bern was named for the bears but the last bear is recorded as having been killed in 1792 above Kleine Scheidegg by three hunters from Grindelwald .
In addition , the city has about 160 museums—the world 's greatest single metropolitan concentration —over 100 art galleries , and some 30 concert halls , all of which maintain a constant cultural activity during the whole year . It has either the third or fourth-highest number of theatres in the world after New York , London and perhaps Toronto . Many areas ( e.g . Palacio Nacional and the National Institute of Cardiology ) have murals painted by Diego Rivera . He and his wife Frida Kahlo lived in Coyoacán , where several of their homes , studios , and art collections are open to the public . The house where Leon Trotsky was initially granted asylum and finally murdered in 1940 is also in Coyoacán .
Following the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912 , Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Tibet Area ( Ü-Tsang ) . The region subsequently declared its independence in 1913 without recognition by the subsequent Chinese Republican government . Later , Lhasa took control of the western part of Xikang , China . The region maintained its autonomy until 1951 when , following the Battle of Chamdo , Tibet became incorporated into the People 's Republic of China , and the previous Tibetan government was abolished in 1959 after a failed uprising . Today , China governs western and central Tibet as the Tibet Autonomous Region while the eastern areas are now mostly ethnic autonomous prefectures within Sichuan , Qinghai and other neighbouring provinces . There are tensions regarding Tibet 's political status and dissident groups that are active in exile . It is also said that Tibetan activists in Tibet have been arrested or tortured .
Politically , Orthodox Jews , given their variety of movements and affiliations , tend not to conform easily to the standard left-right political spectrum , with one of the key differences between the movements stemming from the groups ' attitudes to Zionism . Generally speaking , of the three key strands of Orthodox Judaism , Haredi Orthodox and Hasidic Orthodox Jews are at best ambivalent towards the ideology of Zionism and the creation of the State of Israel , and there are many groups and organisations who are outspokenly anti-Zionistic , seeing the ideology of Zionism as diametrically opposed to the teaching of the Torah , and the Zionist administration of the State of Israel , with its emphasis on militarism and nationalism , as destructive of the Judaic way of life .
Washington University has a large number of student-run musical groups on campus , including 12 official a cappella groups . The Pikers , an all-male group , is the oldest such group on campus . The Greenleafs , an all-female group is the oldest ( and only ) female group on campus . The Mosaic Whispers , founded in 1991 , is the oldest co-ed group on campus . They have produced 9 albums and have appeared on a number of compilation albums , including Ben Folds ' Ben Folds Presents : University A Cappella ! The Amateurs , who also appeared on this album , is another co-ed a cappella group on campus , founded in 1991 . They have recorded seven albums and toured extensively . After Dark is a co-ed a cappella group founded in 2001 . It has released three albums and has won several Contemporary A Capella Recording ( CARA ) awards . In 2008 the group performed on MSNBC during coverage of the vice presidential debate with specially written songs about Joe Biden and Sarah Palin . The Ghost Lights , founded in 2010 , is the campus 's newest and only Broadway , Movies , and Television soundtrack group . They have performed multiple philanthropic concerts in the greater St. Louis area and were honored in November 2010 with the opportunity to perform for Nobel Laureate Douglass North at his birthday celebration .
In an effort at revitalizing the city , New Jersey voters in 1976 passed a referendum , approving casino gambling for Atlantic City ; this came after a 1974 referendum on legalized gambling failed to pass . Immediately after the legislation passed , the owners of the Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel began converting it into the Resorts International . It was the first legal casino in the eastern United States when it opened on May 26 , 1978 . Other casinos were soon constructed along the Boardwalk and , later , in the marina district for a total of eleven today . The introduction of gambling did not , however , quickly eliminate many of the urban problems that plagued Atlantic City . Many people have suggested that it only served to exacerbate those problems , as attested to by the stark contrast between tourism intensive areas and the adjacent impoverished working-class neighborhoods . In addition , Atlantic City has been less popular than Las Vegas , as a gambling city in the United States . Donald Trump helped bring big name boxing bouts to the city to attract customers to his casinos . The boxer Mike Tyson had most of his fights in Atlantic City in the 1980s , which helped Atlantic City achieve nationwide attention as a gambling resort . Numerous highrise condominiums were built for use as permanent residences or second homes . By end of the decade it was one of the most popular tourist destinations in the United States .
Schwarzenegger 's commercial peak was his return as the title character in 1991 's Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , which was the highest-grossing film of 1991 . In 1993 , the National Association of Theatre Owners named him the " International Star of the Decade " . His next film project , the 1993 self-aware action comedy spoof Last Action Hero , was released opposite Jurassic Park , and did not do well at the box office . His next film , the comedy drama True Lies ( 1994 ) , was a popular spy film , and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron .
The construction of cathedrals and castles advanced building technology , leading to the development of large stone buildings . Ancillary structures included new town halls , houses , bridges , and tithe barns . Shipbuilding improved with the use of the rib and plank method rather than the old Roman system of mortise and tenon . Other improvements to ships included the use of lateen sails and the stern-post rudder , both of which increased the speed at which ships could be sailed .
Judging by the historical records , by approximately 1000 AD the predominant ethnic group over much of modern European Russia , Ukraine and Belarus was the Eastern branch of the Slavs , speaking a closely related group of dialects . The political unification of this region into Kievan Rus ' in about 880 , from which modern Russia , Ukraine and Belarus trace their origins , established Old East Slavic as a literary and commercial language . It was soon followed by the adoption of Christianity in 988 and the introduction of the South Slavic Old Church Slavonic as the liturgical and official language . Borrowings and calques from Byzantine Greek began to enter the Old East Slavic and spoken dialects at this time , which in their turn modified the Old Church Slavonic as well .
Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas primarily focus on Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups and Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups . " Y-DNA " is passed solely along the patrilineal line , from father to son , while " mtDNA " is passed down the matrilineal line , from mother to offspring of both sexes . Neither recombines , and thus Y-DNA and mtDNA change only by chance mutation at each generation with no intermixture between parents ' genetic material . Autosomal " atDNA " markers are also used , but differ from mtDNA or Y-DNA in that they overlap significantly . AtDNA is generally used to measure the average continent-of-ancestry genetic admixture in the entire human genome and related isolated populations .
Human interference has nearly exterminated the trees in many areas , and , except for the beech forests of the Austrian Alps , forests of deciduous trees are rarely found after the extreme deforestation between the 17th and 19th centuries . The vegetation has changed since the second half of the 20th century , as the high alpine meadows cease to be harvested for hay or used for grazing which eventually might result in a regrowth of forest . In some areas the modern practice of building ski runs by mechanical means has destroyed the underlying tundra from which the plant life can not recover during the non-skiing months , whereas areas that still practice a natural piste type of ski slope building preserve the fragile underlayers .
In September 1998 , the Fraunhofer Institute sent a letter to several developers of MP3 software stating that a license was required to " distribute and/or sell decoders and/or encoders " . The letter claimed that unlicensed products " infringe the patent rights of Fraunhofer and Thomson . To make , sell and/or distribute products using the [ MPEG Layer-3 ] standard and thus our patents , you need to obtain a license under these patents from us . "
In June 1963 , Rev . Martin Luther King , Jr. gave a major speech in Detroit that foreshadowed his " I Have a Dream " speech in Washington , D.C. two months later . While the African-American Civil Rights Movement gained significant federal civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965 , longstanding inequities resulted in confrontations between the police and inner city black youth wanting change . Longstanding tensions in Detroit culminated in the Twelfth Street riot in July 1967 . Governor George W. Romney ordered the Michigan National Guard into Detroit , and President Johnson sent in U.S. Army troops . The result was 43 dead , 467 injured , over 7,200 arrests , and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed , mostly in black residential and business areas . Thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods . The affected district lay in ruins for decades . It was the most costly riot in the United States .
The Zhengde Emperor ( r. 1505–1521 ) , who enjoyed the company of lamas at court despite protests from the censorate , had heard tales of a " living Buddha " which he desired to host at the Ming capital ; this was none other than the Rinpung-supported Mikyö Dorje , 8th Karmapa Lama then occupying Lhasa . Zhengde 's top advisors made every attempt to dissuade him from inviting this lama to court , arguing that Tibetan Buddhism was wildly heterodox and unorthodox . Despite protests by the Grand Secretary Liang Chu , in 1515 the Zhengde Emperor sent his eunuch official Liu Yun of the Palace Chancellery on a mission to invite this Karmapa to Beijing . Liu commanded a fleet of hundreds of ships requisitioned along the Yangtze , consuming 2,835 g ( 100 oz ) of silver a day in food expenses while stationed for a year in Chengdu of Sichuan . After procurring necessary gifts for the mission , he departed with a cavalry force of about 1,000 troops . When the request was delivered , the Karmapa lama refused to leave Tibet despite the Ming force brought to coerce him . The Karmapa launched a surprise ambush on Liu Yun 's camp , seizing all the goods and valuables while killing or wounding half of Liu Yun 's entire escort . After this fiasco , Liu fled for his life , but only returned to Chengdu several years later to find that the Zhengde Emperor had died .
After the English Civil War the Royal Citadel was built in 1666 on the east end of Plymouth Hoe , to defend the port from naval attacks , suppress Plymothian Parliamentary leanings and to train the armed forces . Guided tours are available in the summer months . Further west is Smeaton 's Tower , which was built in 1759 as a lighthouse on rocks 14 miles ( 23 km ) off shore , but dismantled and the top two thirds rebuilt on the Hoe in 1877 . It is open to the public and has views over the Plymouth Sound and the city from the lantern room . Plymouth has 20 war memorials of which nine are on The Hoe including : Plymouth Naval Memorial , to remember those killed in World Wars I and II , and the Armada Memorial , to commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada .
In music , popular local bands include The Five Stars , Penina o Tiafau and Punialava'a . The Yandall Sisters ' cover of the song Sweet Inspiration reached number one on the New Zealand charts in 1974 . King Kapisi was the first hip hop artist to receive the prestigious New Zealand APRA Silver Scroll Award in 1999 for his song Reverse Resistance . The music video for Reverse Resistance was filmed in Savai'i at his villages . Other successful Samoan hip hop artists include rapper Scribe , Dei Hamo , Savage and Tha Feelstyle whose music video Suamalie was filmed in Samoa .
Humbert is at the center of ascetic writers in the Dominican Order . In this role , he added significantly to its spirituality . His writings are permeated with " religious good sense , " and he used uncomplicated language that could edify even the weakest member . Humbert advised his readers , " [ Young Dominicans ] are also to be instructed not to be eager to see visions or work miracles , since these avail little to salvation , and sometimes we are fooled by them ; but rather they should be eager to do good in which salvation consists . Also , they should be taught not to be sad if they do not enjoy the divine consolations they hear others have ; but they should know the loving Father for some reason sometimes withholds these . Again , they should learn that if they lack the grace of compunction or devotion they should not think they are not in the state of grace as long as they have good will , which is all that God regards " .
The senate 's ultimate authority derived from the esteem and prestige of the senators . This esteem and prestige was based on both precedent and custom , as well as the caliber and reputation of the senators . The senate passed decrees , which were called senatus consulta . These were officially " advice " from the senate to a magistrate . In practice , however , they were usually followed by the magistrates . The focus of the Roman senate was usually directed towards foreign policy . Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict , the senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs . The power of the senate expanded over time as the power of the legislative assemblies declined , and the senate took a greater role in ordinary law-making . Its members were usually appointed by Roman Censors , who ordinarily selected newly elected magistrates for membership in the senate , making the senate a partially elected body . During times of military emergency , such as the civil wars of the 1st century BC , this practice became less prevalent , as the Roman Dictator , Triumvir or the senate itself would select its members .
Sicily fell under the control of the Holy Roman Empire in 1194 . Palermo was the preferred city of the Emperor Frederick II . Muslims of Palermo emigrated or were expelled during Holy Roman rule . After an interval of Angevin rule ( 1266–1282 ) , Sicily came under control of the Aragon and Barcelona dynasties . By 1330 , Palermo 's population had declined to 51,000 . From 1479 until 1713 Palermo was ruled by the Kingdom of Spain , and again between 1717 and 1718 . Palermo was also under Savoy control between 1713 and 1717 and 1718–1720 as a result of the Treaty of Utrecht . It was also ruled by Austria between 1720 and 1734 .
In January 2012 a Tuareg rebellion began in Northern Mali , led by the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad . In March , military officer Amadou Sanogo seized power in a coup d'état , citing Touré 's failures in quelling the rebellion , and leading to sanctions and an embargo by the Economic Community of West African States . The MNLA quickly took control of the north , declaring independence as Azawad . However , Islamist groups including Ansar Dine and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ( AQIM ) , who had helped the MNLA defeat the government , turned on the Tuareg and took control of the North with the goal of implementing sharia in Mali .
The main passenger airport serving the metropolis and the state is Melbourne Airport ( also called Tullamarine Airport ) , which is the second busiest in Australia , and the Port of Melbourne is Australia 's busiest seaport for containerised and general cargo . Melbourne has an extensive transport network . The main metropolitan train terminus is Flinders Street Station , and the main regional train and coach terminus is Southern Cross Station . Melbourne is also home to Australia 's most extensive freeway network and has the world 's largest urban tram network .
Dvaitādvaita was proposed by Nimbarka , a 13th-century Vaishnava Philosopher from the Andhra region . According to this philosophy there are three categories of existence : Brahman , soul , and matter . Soul and matter are different from Brahman in that they have attributes and capacities different from Brahman . Brahman exists independently , while soul and matter are dependent . Thus soul and matter have an existence that is separate yet dependent . Further , Brahman is a controller , the soul is the enjoyer , and matter the thing enjoyed . Also , the highest object of worship is Krishna and his consort Radha , attended by thousands of gopis ; of the Vrindavan ; and devotion consists in self-surrender .
A different format , CD-4 ( not to be confused with compact disc ) , by RCA , encoded the front-rear difference information on an ultrasonic carrier , which required a special wideband cartridge to capture it on carefully calibrated pickup arm/turntable combinations . CD-4 was even less successful than the two matrixed formats . ( A further problem was that no cutting heads were available that could handle the HF information . That was remedied by cutting at half the speed . Later , the special half-speed cutting heads and equalization techniques were employed to get a wider frequency response in stereo with reduced distortion and greater headroom . )
Madonna 's Italian-Catholic background and her relationship with her parents are reflected in the album Like a Prayer . It was an evocation of the impact religion had on her career . Her video for the title track contains Catholic symbolism , such as the stigmata . During The Virgin Tour , she wore a rosary and prayed with it in the music video for " La Isla Bonita " . The " Open Your Heart " video sees her boss scolding her in the Italian language . On the Who 's That Girl World Tour , she dedicated the song " Papa Do n't Preach " to Pope John Paul II .
New York City has more than 2,000 arts and cultural organizations and more than 500 art galleries of all sizes . The city government funds the arts with a larger annual budget than the National Endowment for the Arts . Wealthy business magnates in the 19th century built a network of major cultural institutions , such as the famed Carnegie Hall and The Metropolitan Museum of Art , that would become internationally established . The advent of electric lighting led to elaborate theater productions , and in the 1880s , New York City theaters on Broadway and along 42nd Street began featuring a new stage form that became known as the Broadway musical . Strongly influenced by the city 's immigrants , productions such as those of Harrigan and Hart , George M. Cohan , and others used song in narratives that often reflected themes of hope and ambition .
In the beginning , racial classifications that identified race were inherently suspect and subject to strict scrutiny . These classifications would only be upheld if necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest . Later the U.S. Supreme Court decided that racial classifications that benefited underrepresented minorities were to only be upheld if necessary and promoted a compelling governmental purpose . ( See Richmond v. J.A . Croson Co. ) There is no clear guidance about when government action is not " compelling " , and such rulings are rare .
Ann Arbor was founded in 1824 , named for wives of the village 's founders and the stands of Bur Oak trees . The University of Michigan moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor in 1837 , and the city grew at a rapid rate in the early to mid-20th century . During the 1960s and 1970s , the city gained a reputation as a center for left-wing politics . Ann Arbor became a focal point for political activism and served as a hub for the civil-rights movement and anti-Vietnam War movement , as well as various student movements .
By mid-1942 , the Japanese found themselves holding a vast area from the Indian Ocean to the Central Pacific , even though they lacked the resources to defend or sustain it . Moreover , Combined Fleet doctrine was inadequate to execute the proposed " barrier " defence . Instead , Japan decided on additional attacks in both the south and central Pacific . While she had the element of surprise at Pearl Harbor , Allied codebreakers had now turned the tables . They discovered an attack was planned against Port Moresby ; if it fell , Japan would control the seas to the north and west of Australia and could isolate the country . The carrier USS Lexington under Admiral Fletcher joined USS Yorktown and an American-Australian task force to stop the Japanese advance . The resulting Battle of the Coral Sea , fought in May 1942 , was the first naval battle in which ships involved never sighted each other and only aircraft were used to attack opposing forces . Although Lexington was sunk and Yorktown seriously damaged , the Japanese lost the carrier Shōhō , and suffered extensive damage to Shōkaku and heavy losses to the air wing of Zuikaku , both of which missed the operation against Midway the following month . Although Allied losses were heavier than Japanese , the attack on Port Moresby was thwarted and the Japanese invasion force turned back , a strategic victory for the Allies . The Japanese were forced to abandon their attempts to isolate Australia . Moreover , Japan lacked the capacity to replace losses in ships , planes and trained pilots .
In the PAL region , which covers most of Africa , Asia , Europe , and Oceania , Twilight Princess is the best-selling entry in the Zelda series . During its first week , the game was sold with three of every four Wii purchases . The game had sold 5.82 million copies on the Wii as of March 31 , 2011 [ update ] , and 1.32 million on the GameCube as of March 31 , 2007 [ update ] .
Modern navies that operate such aircraft carriers treat them as the capital ship of the fleet , a role previously held by the battleship . This change took place during World War II in response to air power becoming a significant factor in warfare , driven by the superior range , flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft . Following the war , carrier operations continued to increase in size and importance . Supercarriers , displacing 75,000 tonnes or greater , have become the pinnacle of carrier development . Some are powered by nuclear reactors and form the core of a fleet designed to operate far from home . Amphibious assault ships , such as USS Tarawa and HMS Ocean , serve the purpose of carrying and landing Marines , and operate a large contingent of helicopters for that purpose . Also known as " commando carriers " or " helicopter carriers " , many have the capability to operate VSTOL aircraft .
The New Haven Division buses follow routes that had originally been covered by trolley service . Horse-drawn steetcars began operating in New Haven in the 1860s , and by the mid-1890s all the lines had become electric . In the 1920s and 1930s , some of the trolley lines began to be replaced by bus lines , with the last trolley route converted to bus in 1948 . The City of New Haven is in the very early stages of considering the restoration of streetcar ( light-rail ) service , which has been absent since the postwar period .
Tennis player Marcos Baghdatis was ranked 8th in the world , was a finalist at the Australian Open , and reached the Wimbledon semi-final , all in 2006 . High jumper Kyriakos Ioannou achieved a jump of 2.35 m at the 11th IAAF World Championships in Athletics in Osaka , Japan , in 2007 , winning the bronze medal . He has been ranked third in the world . In motorsports , Tio Ellinas is a successful race car driver , currently racing in the GP3 Series for Marussia Manor Motorsport . There is also mixed martial artist Costas Philippou , who competes in the Ultimate Fighting Championship promotion 's middleweight division . Costas holds a 6-3 record in UFC bouts , and recently defeated " The Monsoon " Lorenz Larkin with a Knockout in the 1st round .
Investitures , which include the conferring of knighthoods by dubbing with a sword , and other awards take place in the palace 's Ballroom , built in 1854 . At 36.6 m ( 120 ft ) long , 18 m ( 59 ft ) wide and 13.5 m ( 44 ft ) high , it is the largest room in the palace . It has replaced the throne room in importance and use . During investitures , the Queen stands on the throne dais beneath a giant , domed velvet canopy , known as a shamiana or a baldachin , that was used at the Delhi Durbar in 1911 . A military band plays in the musicians ' gallery as award recipients approach the Queen and receive their honours , watched by their families and friends .
Elizabeth I of England , primarily interested in trade with the east , collaborated with English merchants to form the first trading companies to the far-flung regions , using their own jargon . Their goals were to obtain trading concessions by treaty . The queen chartered the Company of Merchants of the Levant , shortened to Levant Company , and soon known also as The Turkey Company , in 1581 . In 1582 , the ship The Great Susan transported the first ambassador , William Harebone , to the Ottoman Porte ( government of the Ottoman Empire ) at Constantinople . Compared to Anatolia , Levant also means " land of the rising sun , " but where Anatolia always only meant the projection of land currently occupied by the Republic of Turkey , Levant meant anywhere in the domain ruled by the Ottoman Porte . The East India Company ( short for a much longer formal name ) was chartered in 1600 for trade to the East Indies .
Neptune 's dark spots are thought to occur in the troposphere at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features , so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks . As they are stable features that can persist for several months , they are thought to be vortex structures . Often associated with dark spots are brighter , persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer . The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature . Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism .
Plymouth is often used as a base by visitors to Dartmoor , the Tamar Valley and the beaches of south-east Cornwall . Kingsand , Cawsand and Whitsand Bay are popular .
In 2006–07 , researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society studied gorillas in heavily forested regions centered on the Ouesso district of the Sangha Region . They suggest a population on the order of 125,000 Western Lowland Gorillas , whose isolation from humans has been largely preserved by inhospitable swamps .
Mexico City offers a variety of cuisines . Restaurants specializing in the regional cuisines of Mexico 's 31 states are available in the city . Also available are an array of international cuisines , including Canadian , French , Italian , Croatian , Spanish ( including many regional variations ) , Jewish , Lebanese , Chinese ( again with regional variations ) , Indian , Japanese , Korean , Thai , Vietnamese ; and of course fellow Latin American cuisines such as Argentine , Brazilian , and Peruvian . Haute , fusion , kosher , vegetarian and vegan cuisines are also available , as are restaurants solely based on the concepts of local food and slow Food .
In the 2000 presidential election , Vice President Al Gore , a former Democratic U.S . Senator from Tennessee , failed to carry his home state , an unusual occurrence but indicative of strengthening Republican support . Republican George W. Bush received increased support in 2004 , with his margin of victory in the state increasing from 4 % in 2000 to 14 % in 2004 . Democratic presidential nominees from Southern states ( such as Lyndon B. Johnson , Jimmy Carter , Bill Clinton ) usually fare better than their Northern counterparts do in Tennessee , especially among split-ticket voters outside the metropolitan areas .
Leakage is equivalent to a resistor in parallel with the capacitor . Constant exposure to heat can cause dielectric breakdown and excessive leakage , a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits , particularly where oiled paper and foil capacitors were used . In many vacuum tube circuits , interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage . A leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting , causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube . In power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red , or current limiting resistors to overheat , even fail . Similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid-state ( transistor ) amplifiers , but owing to lower heat production and the use of modern polyester dielectric barriers this once-common problem has become relatively rare .
The Han-era Chinese sailed in a variety of ships differing from those of previous eras , such as the tower ship . The junk design was developed and realized during Han . Junks featured a square-ended bow and stern , a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost , and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western vessels . Moreover , Han ships were the first in the world to be steered using a rudder at the stern , in contrast to the simpler steering oar used for riverine transport , allowing them to sail on the high seas .
The bacterial cell is surrounded by a cell membrane ( also known as a lipid , cytoplasmic or plasma membrane ) . This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients , proteins and other essential components of the cytoplasm within the cell . As they are prokaryotes , bacteria do not usually have membrane-bound organelles in their cytoplasm , and thus contain few large intracellular structures . They lack a true nucleus , mitochondria , chloroplasts and the other organelles present in eukaryotic cells . Bacteria were once seen as simple bags of cytoplasm , but structures such as the prokaryotic cytoskeleton and the localization of proteins to specific locations within the cytoplasm that give bacteria some complexity have been discovered . These subcellular levels of organization have been called " bacterial hyperstructures " .
Emotion regulation refers to the cognitive and behavioral strategies people use to influence their own emotional experience . For example , a behavioral strategy in which one avoids a situation to avoid unwanted emotions ( e.g. , trying not to think about the situation , doing distracting activities , etc. ) . Depending on the particular school 's general emphasis on either cognitive components of emotion , physical energy discharging , or on symbolic movement and facial expression components of emotion , different schools of psychotherapy approach the regulation of emotion differently . Cognitively oriented schools approach them via their cognitive components , such as rational emotive behavior therapy . Yet others approach emotions via symbolic movement and facial expression components ( like in contemporary Gestalt therapy ) .
The body’s capability to react to antigen depends on a person 's age , antigen type , maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented . Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency , because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed . Once born , a child’s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides . In fact , many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas . In neonates , opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited . For example , the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65 % of that found in the adult . Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns . This is due to lower opsonic activity , as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors , which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium . Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production , which also limits the newborn 's phagocytic activity . Although , the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults , the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired . Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells . Also , T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-12 , and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage . B cells develop early during gestation but are not fully active .
The city is also in the process of implementing a 5-year and 20 year Bike Action Plan with a goal of attaining 14 to 35 % bicycle transportation mode share by 2030 through the installation of enhanced bicycle infrastructure throughout the city . Other environmentally focused initiatives include curbside recycling , curbside composting bins ( in addition to trash , yard-waste , and recycle bins ) , farmers ' markets , community gardens , garden-share , an urban forest initiative , a hazardous materials home-collection service , green business certification , and a municipal bus system which is currently being revamped to integrate with the soon-to-open Expo Line .
In 1775 , Patrick Henry delivered his famous " Give me Liberty or Give me Death " speech in St. John 's Church in Richmond , crucial for deciding Virginia 's participation in the First Continental Congress and setting the course for revolution and independence . On April 18 , 1780 , the state capital was moved from the colonial capital of Williamsburg to Richmond , to provide a more centralized location for Virginia 's increasing westerly population , as well as to isolate the capital from British attack . The latter motive proved to be in vain , and in 1781 , under the command of Benedict Arnold , Richmond was burned by British troops , causing Governor Thomas Jefferson to flee as the Virginia militia , led by Sampson Mathews , defended the city .
The January daily average is 33.0 °F ( 0.6 °C ) , though , in a normal winter , the temperature frequently rises to 50 °F ( 10 °C ) during thaws and dips to 10 °F ( −12 °C ) for 2 or 3 nights . July averages 78.1 °F ( 25.6 °C ) , although heat waves accompanied by high humidity and heat indices are frequent ; highs reach or exceed 90 °F ( 32 °C ) on 27 days of the year . The average window for freezing temperatures is November 6 thru April 2 , allowing a growing season of 217 days . Early fall and late winter are generally dry ; February 's average of 2.64 inches ( 67 mm ) makes it the area 's driest month . The dewpoint in the summer averages between 59.1 °F ( 15 °C ) to 64.5 °F ( 18 °C ) .
In the resulting Battle of Pusan Perimeter ( August–September 1950 ) , the U.S. Army withstood KPA attacks meant to capture the city at the Naktong Bulge , P'ohang-dong , and Taegu . The United States Air Force ( USAF ) interrupted KPA logistics with 40 daily ground support sorties that destroyed 32 bridges , halting most daytime road and rail traffic . KPA forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night . To deny matériel to the KPA , the USAF destroyed logistics depots , petroleum refineries , and harbors , while the U.S. Navy air forces attacked transport hubs . Consequently , the over-extended KPA could not be supplied throughout the south . On 27 August , 67th Fighter Squadron aircraft mistakenly attacked facilities in Chinese territory and the Soviet Union called the UN Security Council 's attention to China 's complaint about the incident . The US proposed that a commission of India and Sweden determine what the US should pay in compensation but the Soviets vetoed the US proposal .
Charles Darwin 's book The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms ( 1881 ) presented the first scientific analysis of earthworms ' contributions to soil fertility . Some burrow while others live entirely on the surface , generally in moist leaf litter . The burrowers loosen the soil so that oxygen and water can penetrate it , and both surface and burrowing worms help to produce soil by mixing organic and mineral matter , by accelerating the decomposition of organic matter and thus making it more quickly available to other organisms , and by concentrating minerals and converting them to forms that plants can use more easily . Earthworms are also important prey for birds ranging in size from robins to storks , and for mammals ranging from shrews to badgers , and in some cases conserving earthworms may be essential for conserving endangered birds .
Santa Monica College is a junior college originally founded in 1929 . Many SMC graduates transfer to the University of California system . It occupies 35 acres ( 14 hectares ) and enrolls 30,000 students annually . The Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School , associated with the RAND Corporation , is the U.S. 's largest producer of public policy PhDs . The Art Institute of California – Los Angeles is also located in Santa Monica near the Santa Monica Airport . Universities and colleges within a 22-mile ( 35 km ) radius from Santa Monica include Santa Monica College , Antioch University Los Angeles , Loyola Marymount University , Mount St. Mary 's College , Pepperdine University , California State University , Northridge , California State University , Los Angeles , UCLA , USC , West Los Angeles College , California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) , Occidental College ( Oxy ) , Los Angeles City College , Los Angeles Southwest College , Los Angeles Valley College , and Emperor 's College of Traditional Oriental Medicine .
Every major company selling the antipsychotics — Bristol-Myers Squibb , Eli Lilly , Pfizer , AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson — has either settled recent government cases , under the False Claims Act , for hundreds of millions of dollars or is currently under investigation for possible health care fraud . Following charges of illegal marketing , two of the settlements set records last year for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations . One involved Eli Lilly 's antipsychotic Zyprexa , and the other involved Bextra . In the Bextra case , the government also charged Pfizer with illegally marketing another antipsychotic , Geodon ; Pfizer settled that part of the claim for $ 301 million , without admitting any wrongdoing .
Purebred dogs of one breed are genetically distinguishable from purebred dogs of other breeds , but the means by which kennel clubs classify dogs is unsystematic . Systematic analyses of the dog genome has revealed only four major types of dogs that can be said to be statistically distinct . These include the " old world dogs " ( e.g. , Malamute and Shar Pei ) , " Mastiff " -type ( e.g. , English Mastiff ) , " herding " -type ( e.g. , Border Collie ) , and " all others " ( also called " modern " - or " hunting " -type ) .
The resultant South Korean government promulgated a national political constitution on 17 July 1948 , and elected Syngman Rhee as President on 20 July 1948 . The Republic of Korea ( South Korea ) was established on 15 August 1948 . In the Russian Korean Zone of Occupation , the Soviet Union established a Communist North Korean government led by Kim Il-sung . President Rhee 's régime excluded communists and leftists from southern politics . Disenfranchised , they headed for the hills , to prepare for guerrilla war against the US-sponsored ROK Government .
The Karabakh war ended after a Russian-brokered cease-fire was put in place in 1994 . The war was a success for the Karabakh Armenian forces who managed to capture 16 % of Azerbaijan 's internationally recognised territory including Nagorno-Karabakh itself . Since then , Armenia and Azerbaijan have held peace talks , mediated by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) . The status of Karabakh has yet to be determined . The economies of both countries have been hurt in the absence of a complete resolution and Armenia 's borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan remain closed . By the time both Azerbaijan and Armenia had finally agreed to a ceasefire in 1994 , an estimated 30,000 people had been killed and over a million had been displaced .
Fearing the worst , the Romans began a major mobilization , all but pulling out of recently pacified Spain and Gaul . They even established a major garrison in Sicily in case the Seleucids ever got to Italy . This fear was shared by Rome 's Greek allies , who had largely ignored Rome in the years after the Second Macedonian War , but now followed Rome again for the first time since that war . A major Roman-Greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the Second Punic War , Scipio Africanus , and set out for Greece , beginning the Roman-Syrian War . After initial fighting that revealed serious Seleucid weaknesses , the Seleucids tried to turn the Roman strength against them at the Battle of Thermopylae ( as they believed the 300 Spartans had done centuries earlier ) . Like the Spartans , the Seleucids lost the battle , and were forced to evacuate Greece . The Romans pursued the Seleucids by crossing the Hellespont , which marked the first time a Roman army had ever entered Asia . The decisive engagement was fought at the Battle of Magnesia , resulting in a complete Roman victory . The Seleucids sued for peace , and Rome forced them to give up their recent Greek conquests . Although they still controlled a great deal of territory , this defeat marked the decline of their empire , as they were to begin facing increasingly aggressive subjects in the east ( the Parthians ) and the west ( the Greeks ) . Their empire disintegrated into a rump over the course of the next century , when it was eclipsed by Pontus . Following Magnesia , Rome again withdrew from Greece , assuming ( or hoping ) that the lack of a major Greek power would ensure a stable peace . In fact , it did the opposite .
Atkins , a former member of Cybotron , released Model 500 " No UFOs " in 1985 , which became a regional hit , followed by dozens of tracks on Transmat , Metroplex and Fragile . One of the most unusual was " Strings of Life " by Derrick May , a darker , more intellectual strain of house . " Techno-Scratch " was released by the Knights Of The Turntable in 1984 which had a similar techno sound to Cybotron . The manager of the Factory nightclub and co-owner of the Haçienda , Tony Wilson , also promoted acid house culture on his weekly TV show . The Midlands also embraced the late 1980s house scene with illegal parties and more legal dance clubs such as The Hummingbird .
The CBC 's flagship newscast , The National , airs Sunday through Fridays at 10:00 p.m. EST and Saturdays at 6:00 p.m. EST . Until October 2006 , CBC owned-and-operated stations aired a second broadcast of the program at 11:00 p.m. ; this later broadcast included only the main news portion of the program , and excluded the analysis and documentary segment . This second airing was later replaced with other programming , and as of the 2012-13 television season , was replaced on CBC 's major market stations by a half-hour late newscast . There is also a short news update , at most , on late Saturday evenings . During hockey season , this update is usually found during the first intermission of the second game of the doubleheader on Hockey Night in Canada .
A diverse range of indigenous cultures exist in Myanmar , the majority culture is primarily Buddhist and Bamar . Bamar culture has been influenced by the cultures of neighbouring countries . This is manifested in its language , cuisine , music , dance and theatre . The arts , particularly literature , have historically been influenced by the local form of Theravada Buddhism . Considered the national epic of Myanmar , the Yama Zatdaw , an adaptation of India 's Ramayana , has been influenced greatly by Thai , Mon , and Indian versions of the play . Buddhism is practised along with nat worship , which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats .
The trial in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger in 1735 helped to establish the freedom of the press in North America . In 1754 , Columbia University was founded under charter by King George II as King 's College in Lower Manhattan . The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765 as the Sons of Liberty organized in the city , skirmishing over the next ten years with British troops stationed there .
In March 1861 , Victoria 's mother died , with Victoria at her side . Through reading her mother 's papers , Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply ; she was heart-broken , and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for " wickedly " estranging her from her mother . To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief , Albert took on most of her duties , despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble . In August , Victoria and Albert visited their son , the Prince of Wales , who was attending army manoeuvres near Dublin , and spent a few days holidaying in Killarney . In November , Albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in Ireland . Appalled , Albert travelled to Cambridge , where his son was studying , to confront him . By the beginning of December , Albert was very unwell . He was diagnosed with typhoid fever by William Jenner , and died on 14 December 1861 . Victoria was devastated . She blamed her husband 's death on worry over the Prince of Wales 's philandering . He had been " killed by that dreadful business " , she said . She entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life . She avoided public appearances , and rarely set foot in London in the following years . Her seclusion earned her the nickname " widow of Windsor " .
The Soviets also helped Germany to avoid British naval blockades by providing a submarine base , Basis Nord , in the northern Soviet Union near Murmansk . This also provided a refueling and maintenance location , and a takeoff point for raids and attacks on shipping . In addition , the Soviets provided Germany with access to the Northern Sea Route for both cargo ships and raiders ( though only the commerce raider Komet used the route before the German invasion ) , which forced Britain to protect sea lanes in both the Atlantic and the Pacific .
The FBI often works in conjunction with other Federal agencies , including the U.S. Coast Guard ( USCG ) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) in seaport and airport security , and the National Transportation Safety Board in investigating airplane crashes and other critical incidents . Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations ( ICE-HSI ) has nearly the same amount of investigative man power as the FBI , and investigates the largest range of crimes . In the wake of the September 11 attacks , then-Attorney General Ashcroft assigned the FBI as the designated lead organization in terrorism investigations after the creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security . ICE-HSI and the FBI are both integral members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force .
On 7 June 1981 , the Israeli air force destroyed Iraq 's sole nuclear reactor , in order to impede Iraq 's nuclear weapons program . The reactor was under construction just outside Baghdad . Following a series of PLO attacks in 1982 , Israel invaded Lebanon that year to destroy the bases from which the PLO launched attacks and missiles into northern Israel . In the first six days of fighting , the Israelis destroyed the military forces of the PLO in Lebanon and decisively defeated the Syrians . An Israeli government inquiry – the Kahan Commission – would later hold Begin , Sharon and several Israeli generals as indirectly responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacre . In 1985 , Israel responded to a Palestinian terrorist attack in Cyprus by bombing the PLO headquarters in Tunis . Israel withdrew from most of Lebanon in 1986 , but maintained a borderland buffer zone in southern Lebanon until 2000 , from where Israeli forces engaged in conflict with Hezbollah .
The region is serviced by 4,200 km ( 2,600 mi ) of roads used by 6 million vehicles . Train travel is well established in the Alps , with , for instance 120 km ( 75 mi ) of track for every 1,000 km2 ( 390 sq mi ) in a country such as Switzerland . Most of Europe 's highest railways are located there . Moreover , plans are underway to build a 57 km ( 35 mi ) -long sub-alpine tunnel connecting the older Lötschberg and Gotthard tunnels built in the 19th century .
Anxious to expand the company 's broadcast and cable presence , longtime MCA head Lew Wasserman sought a rich partner . He located Japanese electronics manufacturer Matsushita Electric ( now known as Panasonic ) , which agreed to acquire MCA for $ 6.6 billion in 1990 . Meanwhile , around this time , the production subsidiary was renamed Universal Studios Inc. , and ( in 1990 ) MCA created MCA/Universal Home Video Inc. for the VHS video cassette ( later DVD ) sales industry .
In December 1941 , Japan launched , in quick succession , attacks on British Malaya , the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor , and Hong Kong . Churchill 's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the empire was safe , but the manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain 's standing and prestige as an imperial power . Most damaging of all was the fall of Singapore , which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar . The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand , which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces , into closer ties with the United States . This resulted in the 1951 ANZUS Pact between Australia , New Zealand and the United States of America .
In the assembly elections held in November 2012 , the Congress secured an absolute majority . The Congress won 36 of the 68 seats while the BJP won only 26 of the 68 seats . Virbhadra Singh was sworn-in as Himachal Pradesh 's Chief Minister for a record sixth term in Shimla on 25 December 2012 . Virbhadra Singh who has held the top office in Himachal five times in the past , was administered the oath of office and secrecy by Governor Urmila Singh at an open ceremony at the historic Ridge Maidan in Shimla .
Meanwhile , in Renaissance Italy , a new period in the history of translation had opened in Florence with the arrival , at the court of Cosimo de ' Medici , of the Byzantine scholar Georgius Gemistus Pletho shortly before the fall of Constantinople to the Turks ( 1453 ) . A Latin translation of Plato 's works was undertaken by Marsilio Ficino . This and Erasmus ' Latin edition of the New Testament led to a new attitude to translation . For the first time , readers demanded rigor of rendering , as philosophical and religious beliefs depended on the exact words of Plato , Aristotle and Jesus .
As a child , young Bell displayed a natural curiosity about his world , resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age . His best friend was Ben Herdman , a neighbor whose family operated a flour mill , the scene of many forays . Young Bell asked what needed to be done at the mill . He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12 , Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes , creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years . In return , John Herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to " invent " .
Passos Coelho also announced that the retirement age will be increased from 65 to 66 , announced cuts in the pensions , unemployment benefits , health , education and science expenses , abolished the English obligatory classes in Basic Education , but kept the pensions of the judges , diplomats untouched and did n't raise the retirement age of the military and police forces . He has , however , cut meaningfully the politicians salaries . These policies have led to social unrest and to confrontations between several institutions , namely between the Government and the Constitutional Court . Several individualities belonging to the parties that support the government have also raised their voices against the policies that have been taken in order to try to solve the financial crisis .
Miami has six major causeways that span over Biscayne Bay connecting the western mainland , with the eastern barrier islands along the Atlantic Ocean . The Rickenbacker Causeway is the southernmost causeway and connects Brickell to Virginia Key and Key Biscayne . The Venetian Causeway and MacArthur Causeway connect Downtown with South Beach . The Julia Tuttle Causeway connects Midtown and Miami Beach . The 79th Street Causeway connects the Upper East Side with North Beach . The northernmost causeway , the Broad Causeway , is the smallest of Miami 's six causeways , and connects North Miami with Bal Harbour .
Egypt actively practices capital punishment . Egypt 's authorities do not release figures on death sentences and executions , despite repeated requests over the years by human rights organisations . The United Nations human rights office and various NGOs expressed " deep alarm " after an Egyptian Minya Criminal Court sentenced 529 people to death in a single hearing on 25 March 2014 . Sentenced supporters of former President Mohamed Morsi will be executed for their alleged role in violence following his ousting in July 2013 . The judgment was condemned as a violation of international law . By May 2014 , approximately 16,000 people ( and as high as more than 40,000 by one independent count ) , mostly Brotherhood members or supporters , have been imprisoned after the coup after the Muslim Brotherhood was labelled as terrorist organisation by the post-coup interim Egyptian government .
Northwestern has several housing options , including both traditional residence halls and residential colleges which gather together students who have a particular intellectual interest in common . Among the residential colleges are the Residential College of Cultural and Community Studies ( CCS ) , Ayers College of Commerce and Industry , Jones Residential College ( Arts ) , and Slivka Residential College ( Science and Engineering ) . Dorms include 1835 Hinman , Bobb-McCulloch , Foster-Walker complex ( commonly referred to as Plex ) , and several more . In Winter 2013 , 39 % of undergraduates were affiliated with a fraternity or sorority . Northwestern recognizes 21 fraternities and 18 sororities .
Iran has leading manufacturing industries in the fields of car-manufacture and transportation , construction materials , home appliances , food and agricultural goods , armaments , pharmaceuticals , information technology , power and petrochemicals in the Middle East . According to FAO , Iran has been a top five producer of the following agricultural products in the world in 2012 : apricots , cherries , sour cherries , cucumbers and gherkins , dates , eggplants , figs , pistachios , quinces , walnuts , and watermelons .
St. Barthélemy has about 25 hotels , most of them with 15 rooms or fewer . The largest has 58 rooms . Hotels are classified in the traditional French manner ; 3 Star , 4 Star and 4 Star Luxe . Of particular note are Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc . Hotel Le Toiny , the most expensive hotel on the island , has 12 rooms . Most places of accommodation are in the form of private villas , of which there are some 400 available to rent on the island . The island 's tourism industry , though expensive , attracts 70,000 visitors every year to its luxury hotels and villas and another 130,000 people arrive by luxury boats . It also attracts a labour force from Brazil and Portugal to meet the industry needs .
London 's largest industry is finance , and its financial exports make it a large contributor to the UK 's balance of payments . Around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in London until mid-2007 . London has over 480 overseas banks , more than any other city in the world . Over 85 percent ( 3.2 million ) of the employed population of greater London works in the services industries . Because of its prominent global role , London 's economy had been affected by the Late-2000s financial crisis . However , by 2010 the City has recovered ; put in place new regulatory powers , proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established London 's economic dominance . The City of London is home to the Bank of England , London Stock Exchange , and Lloyd 's of London insurance market .
The Air Force also provides Commissioned Officer Training ( COT ) for officers of all three components who are direct-commissioned to non-line positions due to their credentials in medicine , law , religion , biological sciences , or healthcare administration . Originally viewed as a " knife and fork school " that covered little beyond basic wear of the uniform , COT in recent years has been fully integrated into the OTS program and today encompasses extensive coursework as well as field exercises in leadership , confidence , fitness , and deployed-environment operations .
In 680 Ibn al-Zubayr fled Medina for Mecca . Hearing about Husayn 's opposition to Yazid I , the people of Kufa sent to Husayn asking him to take over with their support . Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him . When the news reached Yazid I , he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad , ruler of Basrah , with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn . Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him . Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa , Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa . The request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad killed Muslim bin Agail . While Ibn al-Zubayr would stay in Mecca until his death , Husayn decided to travel on to Kufa with his family , unaware of the lack of support there . Husayn and his family were intercepted by Yazid I 's forces led by Amru bin Saad , Shamar bin Thi Al-Joshan , and Hussain bin Tamim , who fought Al-Husayn and his male family members until they were killed . There were 200 people in Husayn 's caravan , many of whom were women , including his sisters , wives , daughters and their children . The women and children from Husayn 's camp were taken as prisoners of war and led back to Damascus to be presented to Yazid I . They remained imprisoned until public opinion turned against him as word of Husayn 's death and his family 's capture spread . They were then granted passage back to Medina . The sole adult male survivor from the caravan was Ali ibn Husayn who was with fever too ill to fight when the caravan was attacked .
On 23 February , the 28th Marine Regiment reached the summit of Suribachi , prompting the now famous Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima picture . Navy Secretary James Forrestal , upon seeing the flag , remarked " there will be a Marine Corps for the next 500 years . " The flag raising is often cited as the most reproduced photograph of all time and became the archetypal representation not only of that battle , but of the entire Pacific War . For the rest of February , the Americans pushed north , and by 1 March , had taken two-thirds of the island . But it was not until 26 March that the island was finally secured . The Japanese fought to the last man , killing 6,800 Marines and wounding nearly 20,000 more . The Japanese losses totaled well over 20,000 men killed , and only 1,083 prisoners were taken . Historians debate whether it was strategically worth the casualties sustained .
The band , now revitalised by the response to Live Aid – a " shot in the arm " Roger Taylor called it , — and the ensuing increase in record sales , ended 1985 by releasing the single " One Vision " , which was the third time after " Stone Cold Crazy " and " Under Pressure ( with David Bowie ) " that all four bandmembers received a writing credit for the one song . Also , a limited-edition boxed set containing all Queen albums to date was released under the title of The Complete Works . The package included previously unreleased material , most notably Queen 's non-album single of Christmas 1984 , titled " Thank God It 's Christmas " .
The pro-decolonisation Labour government , elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee , moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire : that of Indian independence . India 's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades , but disagreed as to how it should be implemented . Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state , whereas the League , fearing domination by the Hindu majority , desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions . Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948 . When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent , the newly appointed ( and last ) Viceroy , Lord Mountbatten , hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947 . The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan . Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa , and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives . Burma , which had been administered as part of the British Raj , and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948 . India , Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth , while Burma chose not to join .
A recent addition to the exhibition is the late 13th-century Westminster Retable , England 's oldest altarpiece , which was most probably designed for the high altar of the abbey . Although it has been damaged in past centuries , the panel has been expertly cleaned and conserved .
Other Christian denominations on the island include : Roman Catholic ( since 1852 ) , Salvation Army ( since 1884 ) , Baptist ( since 1845 ) and , in more recent times , Seventh-day Adventist ( since 1949 ) , New Apostolic and Jehovah 's Witnesses ( of which one in 35 residents is a member , the highest ratio of any country ) . The Catholics are pastorally served by the Mission sui iuris of Saint Helena , Ascension and Tristan da Cunha , whose office of ecclesiastical superior is vested in the Apostolic Prefecture of the Falkland Islands .
During her grandfather 's reign , Elizabeth was third in the line of succession to the throne , behind her uncle Edward , Prince of Wales , and her father , the Duke of York . Although her birth generated public interest , she was not expected to become queen , as the Prince of Wales was still young , and many assumed that he would marry and have children of his own . When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII , she became second-in-line to the throne , after her father . Later that year Edward abdicated , after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis . Consequently , Elizabeth 's father became king , and she became heir presumptive . If her parents had had a later son , she would have lost her position as first-in-line , as her brother would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession .
Ibn Sina ( Avicenna ) is regarded as the most influential philosopher of Islam . He pioneered the science of experimental medicine and was the first physician to conduct clinical trials . His two most notable works in medicine are the Kitāb al-shifāʾ ( " Book of Healing " ) and The Canon of Medicine , both of which were used as standard medicinal texts in both the Muslim world and in Europe well into the 17th century . Amongst his many contributions are the discovery of the contagious nature of infectious diseases , and the introduction of clinical pharmacology .
After working for many years at the University of Chicago , Arthur Holly Compton returned to St. Louis in 1946 to serve as Washington University 's ninth chancellor . Compton reestablished the Washington University football team , making the declaration that athletics were to be henceforth played on a " strictly amateur " basis with no athletic scholarships . Under Compton’s leadership , enrollment at the University grew dramatically , fueled primarily by World War II veterans ' use of their GI Bill benefits .
Cities not served by road , sea , or river can be reached only by air , foot , dogsled , or snowmachine , accounting for Alaska 's extremely well developed bush air services—an Alaskan novelty . Anchorage and , to a lesser extent Fairbanks , is served by many major airlines . Because of limited highway access , air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state . Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism ( in 2012-2013 , Alaska received almost 2 million visitors ) .
By September 2008 , average U.S. housing prices had declined by over 20 % from their mid-2006 peak . As prices declined , borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages could not refinance to avoid the higher payments associated with rising interest rates and began to default . During 2007 , lenders began foreclosure proceedings on nearly 1.3 million properties , a 79 % increase over 2006 . This increased to 2.3 million in 2008 , an 81 % increase vs. 2007 . By August 2008 , 9.2 % of all U.S. mortgages outstanding were either delinquent or in foreclosure . By September 2009 , this had risen to 14.4 % .
On May 16 , rescue groups from South Korea , Japan , Singapore , Russia and Taiwan arrived to join the rescue effort . The United States shared some of its satellite images of the quake-stricken areas with Chinese authorities . During the weekend , the US sent into China two U.S. Air Force C-17 's carrying supplies , which included tents and generators . Xinhua reported 135,000 Chinese troops and medics were involved in the rescue effort across 58 counties and cities .
In 2005 , Estonia joined the European Union 's Nordic Battle Group . It has also shown continued interest in joining the Nordic Council . Whereas in 1992 Russia accounted for 92 % of Estonia 's international trade , today there is extensive economic interdependence between Estonia and its Nordic neighbours : three quarters of foreign investment in Estonia originates in the Nordic countries ( principally Finland and Sweden ) , to which Estonia sends 42 % of its exports ( as compared to 6.5 % going to Russia , 8.8 % to Latvia , and 4.7 % to Lithuania ) . On the other hand , the Estonian political system , its flat rate of income tax , and its non-welfare-state model distinguish it from the Nordic countries and their Nordic model , and indeed from many other European countries .
On 9 July 2006 , during Mass at Valencia 's Cathedral , Our Lady of the Forsaken Basilica , Pope Benedict XVI used , at the World Day of Families , the Santo Caliz , a 1st-century Middle-Eastern artifact that some Catholics believe is the Holy Grail . It was supposedly brought to that church by Emperor Valerian in the 3rd century , after having been brought by St. Peter to Rome from Jerusalem . The Santo Caliz ( Holy Chalice ) is a simple , small stone cup . Its base was added in Medieval Times and consists of fine gold , alabaster and gem stones .
The Saxon and Austrian armies were unprepared , and their forces were scattered . Frederick occupied Dresden with little or no opposition from the Saxons . At the Battle of Lobositz on 1 October 1756 , Frederick prevented the isolated Saxon army from being reinforced by an Austrian army under General Browne . The Prussians then occupied Saxony ; after the Siege of Pirna , the Saxon army surrendered in October 1756 , and was forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army . The attack on neutral Saxony caused outrage across Europe and led to the strengthening of the anti-Prussian coalition . The only significant Austrian success was the partial occupation of Silesia . Far from being easy , Frederick 's early successes proved indecisive and very costly for Prussia 's smaller army . This led him to remark that he did not fight the same Austrians as he had during the previous war .
Code 127 is officially named " delete " but the Teletype label was " rubout " . Since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes , interpretations of this code varied . The original Teletype meaning , and the intent of the standard , was to make it an ignored character , the same as NUL ( all zeroes ) . This was useful specifically for paper tape , because punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it . Tapes designed to be " hand edited " could even be produced with spaces of extra NULs ( blank tape ) so that a block of characters could be " rubbed out " and then replacements put into the empty space .
On December 25 , 1991 , following the collapse of the Soviet Union , the republic was renamed the Russian Federation , which it remains to this day . This name and " Russia " were specified as the official state names in the April 21 , 1992 amendment to the existing constitution and were retained as such in the 1993 Constitution of Russia .
For collectable or nostalgia purposes , or for the benefit of higher-quality audio playback provided by the 78 rpm speed with newer vinyl records and their lightweight stylus pickups , a small number of 78 rpm records have been released since the major labels ceased production . One of the first attempts at this was in the 1950s , when inventor Ewing Dunbar Nunn founded the label Audiophile Records , which released , in addition to standard 33 1/3 rpm LPs , 78 rpm-mastered albums that were microgroove and pressed on vinyl ( as opposed to traditional 78s , with their shellac composition and wider 3-mil sized grooves ) . This was done by the label mainly to take advantage of the wider audio frequency response that faster speeds like 78 rpm can provide for vinyl microgroove records , hence the label 's name ( obviously catering to the audiophiles of the 1950s " hi-fi " era , when stereo gear could provide a much wider range of audio than before ) . Also in the late 1950s , Bell Records released a few budget-priced 7 " microgrooved records at 78 rpm .
The Rambla is an avenue that goes along the entire coastline of Montevideo . The literal meaning of the Spanish word rambla is " avenue " or " watercourse " , but in the Americas it is mostly used as " coastal avenue " , and since all the southern departments of Uruguay border either the Río de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean , they all have ramblas as well . As an integral part of Montevidean identity , the Rambla has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of World Heritage sites , though it has not received this status . Previously , the entire Rambla was called Rambla Naciones Unidas ( " United Nations " ) , but in recent times different names have been given to specific parts of it .

Hellenistic warfare was a continuation of the military developments of Iphicrates and Philip II of Macedon , particularly his use of the Macedonian Phalanx , a dense formation of pikemen , in conjunction with heavy companion cavalry . Armies of the Hellenistic period differed from those of the classical period in being largely made up of professional soldiers and also in their greater specialization and technical proficiency in siege warfare . Hellenistic armies were significantly larger than those of classical Greece relying increasingly on Greek mercenaries ( misthophoroi ; men-for-pay ) and also on non-Greek soldiery such as Thracians , Galatians , Egyptians and Iranians . Some ethnic groups were known for their martial skill in a particular mode of combat and were highly sought after , including Tarantine cavalry , Cretan archers , Rhodian slingers and Thracian peltasts . This period also saw the adoption of new weapons and troop types such as Thureophoroi and the Thorakitai who used the oval Thureos shield and fought with javelins and the machaira sword . The use of heavily armored cataphracts and also horse archers was adopted by the Seleucids , Greco-Bactrians , Armenians and Pontus . The use of war elephants also became common . Seleucus received Indian war elephants from the Mauryan empire , and used them to good effect at the battle of Ipsus . He kept a core of 500 of them at Apameia . The Ptolemies used the smaller African elephant .
For instance , if a transmitter delivers 100 W into an antenna having an efficiency of 80 % , then the antenna will radiate 80 W as radio waves and produce 20 W of heat . In order to radiate 100 W of power , one would need to use a transmitter capable of supplying 125 W to the antenna . Note that antenna efficiency is a separate issue from impedance matching , which may also reduce the amount of power radiated using a given transmitter . If an SWR meter reads 150 W of incident power and 50 W of reflected power , that means that 100 W have actually been absorbed by the antenna ( ignoring transmission line losses ) . How much of that power has actually been radiated can not be directly determined through electrical measurements at ( or before ) the antenna terminals , but would require ( for instance ) careful measurement of field strength . Fortunately the loss resistance of antenna conductors such as aluminum rods can be calculated and the efficiency of an antenna using such materials predicted .
Nick Fradiani won the season , defeating Clark Beckham . By winning , Fradiani became the first winner from the Northeast region . Fradiani released " Beautiful Life " as his coronation single while Beckham released " Champion " . Jax , the third place finalist , also released a single called " Forcefield " .
Louis XIV distrusted the Parisians and moved his court to Versailles in 1682 , but his reign also saw an unprecedented flourishing of the arts and sciences in Paris . The Comédie-Française , the Academy of Painting , and the French Academy of Sciences were founded and made their headquarters in the city . To show that the city was safe against attack , he had the city walls demolished , replacing them with Grands Boulevards . To leave monuments to his reign , he built the Collège des Quatre-Nations , Place Vendôme , Place des Victoires , and began Les Invalides .
After Christianization , the Roman Catholic Church and local rulers led German expansion and settlement in areas inhabited by Slavs and Balts , known as Ostsiedlung . During the wars waged in the Baltic by the Catholic German Teutonic Knights ; the lands inhabited by the ethnic group of the Old Prussians ( the current reference to the people known then simply as the " Prussians " ) , were conquered by the Germans . The Old Prussians were an ethnic group related to the Latvian and Lithuanian Baltic peoples . The former German state of Prussia took its name from the Baltic Prussians , although it was led by Germans who had assimilated the Old Prussians ; the old Prussian language was extinct by the 17th or early 18th century . The Slavic people of the Teutonic-controlled Baltic were assimilated into German culture and eventually there were many intermarriages of Slavic and German families , including amongst the Prussia 's aristocracy known as the Junkers . Prussian military strategist Karl von Clausewitz is a famous German whose surname is of Slavic origin . Massive German settlement led to the assimilation of Baltic ( Old Prussians ) and Slavic ( Wends ) populations , who were exhausted by previous warfare .
The Victorian era of the United Kingdom was the period of Queen Victoria 's reign from June 1837 to January 1901 . This was a long period of prosperity for the British people , as profits gained from the overseas British Empire , as well as from industrial improvements at home , allowed a large , educated middle class to develop . Some scholars would extend the beginning of the period—as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political games that have come to be associated with the Victorians—back five years to the passage of the Reform Act 1832 .
During the NES era , Nintendo maintained exclusive control over titles released for the system—the company had to approve every game , each third-party developer could only release up to five games per year ( but some third parties got around this by using different names , for example Konami 's " Ultra Games " brand ) , those games could not be released on another console within two years , and Nintendo was the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of NES cartridges . However , competition from Sega 's console brought an end to this practice ; in 1991 , Acclaim began releasing games for both platforms , with most of Nintendo 's other licensees following suit over the next several years ; Capcom ( which licensed some games to Sega instead of producing them directly ) and Square were the most notable holdouts .
In 2010 and 2011 , state and federal funds were awarded to Connecticut ( and Massachusetts ) to construct the Hartford Line , with a southern terminus at New Haven 's Union Station and a northern terminus at Springfield 's Union Station . According to the White House , " This corridor [ currently ] has one train per day connecting communities in Connecticut and Massachusetts to the Northeast Corridor and Vermont . The vision for this corridor is to restore the alignment to its original route via the Knowledge Corridor in western Massachusetts , improving trip time and increasing the population base that can be served . " Set for construction in 2013 , the " Knowledge Corridor high speed intercity passenger rail " project will cost approximately $ 1 billion , and the ultimate northern terminus for the project is reported to be Montreal in Canada . Train speeds between will reportedly exceed 110 miles per hour ( 180 km/h ) and increase both cities ' rail traffic exponentially .
Philadelphia artists have had a prominent national role in popular music . In the 1970s , Philadelphia soul influenced the music of that and later eras . On July 13 , 1985 , Philadelphia hosted the American end of the Live Aid concert at John F. Kennedy Stadium . The city reprised this role for the Live 8 concert , bringing some 700,000 people to the Ben Franklin Parkway on July 2 , 2005 . Philadelphia is home to the world-renowned Philadelphia Boys Choir & Chorale , which has performed its music all over the world . Dr. Robert G. Hamilton , founder of the choir , is a notable native Philadelphian . The Philly Pops is another famous Philadelphia music group . The city has played a major role in the development and support of American rock music and rap music . Hip-hop/Rap artists such as The Roots , DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince , The Goats , Freeway , Schoolly D , Eve , and Lisa " Left Eye " Lopes hail from the city .
Both the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira have a subtropical climate , although variations between islands exist , making weather predictions very difficult ( owing to rough topography ) . The Madeira and Azorean archipelagos have a narrower temperature range , with annual average temperatures exceeding 20 °C ( 68 °F ) along the coast ( according to the Portuguese Meteorological Institute ) . Some islands in Azores do have drier months in the summer . Consequently , the island of the Azores have been identified as having a Mediterranean climate ( both Csa and Csb types ) , while some islands ( such as Flores or Corvo ) are classified as Maritime Temperate ( Cfb ) and Humid subtropical ( Cfa ) , respectively , according to Köppen-Geiger classification .
Little is known about the bacteria that degrade cellulose . Symbiotic bacteria in Xylophaga may play a role in the degradation of sunken wood ; while bacteria such as Alphaproteobacteria , Flavobacteria , Actinobacteria , Clostridia , and Bacteroidetes have been detected in wood submerged over a year .
After dynastic quarrels however , there was a Christian reconquest in 1072 . The family who returned the city to Christianity were called the Hautevilles , including Robert Guiscard and his army , who is regarded as a hero by the natives . It was under Roger II of Sicily that Norman holdings in Sicily and the southern part of the Italian Peninsula were promoted from the County of Sicily into the Kingdom of Sicily . The Kingdom 's capital was Palermo , with the King 's Court held at the Palazzo dei Normanni . Much construction was undertaken during this period , such as the building of Palermo Cathedral . The Kingdom of Sicily became one of the wealthiest states in Europe .
The initial military maneuvers began in September 1806 . In a notable letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign , Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carré ( 'square battalion ' ) . In the bataillon-carré system , the various corps of the Grande Armée would march uniformly together in close supporting distance . If any single corps was attacked , the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help . Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops , rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale . As in previous campaigns , his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war . Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army , the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force . At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt , fought on 14 October , the French convincingly defeated the Prussians and inflicted heavy casualties . With several major commanders dead or incapacitated , the Prussian king proved incapable of effectively commanding the army , which began to quickly disintegrate . In a vaunted pursuit that epitomized the " peak of Napoleonic warfare , " according to historian Richard Brooks , the French managed to capture 140,000 soldiers , over 2,000 cannons and hundreds of ammunition wagons , all in a single month . Historian David Chandler wrote of the Prussian forces : " Never has the morale of any army been more completely shattered . " Despite their overwhelming defeat , the Prussians refused to negotiate with the French until the Russians had an opportunity to enter the fight .
In 1852 , Elisha Otis introduced the safety elevator , which prevented the fall of the cab if the cable broke . The design of the Otis safety elevator is somewhat similar to one type still used today . A governor device engages knurled roller ( s ) , locking the elevator to its guides should the elevator descend at excessive speed . He demonstrated it at the New York exposition in the Crystal Palace in a dramatic , death-defying presentation in 1854 , and the first such passenger elevator was installed at 488 Broadway in New York City on March 23 , 1857 .
In response , the EU decided to fill the gap left behind by the US under the Sandbaek report . According to its Annual Report for 2008 , the UNFPA received its funding mainly from European Governments : Of the total income of M845.3 M , $ 118 was donated by the Netherlands , $ 67 M by Sweden , $ 62 M by Norway , $ 54 M by Denmark , $ 53 M by the UK , $ 52 M by Spain , $ 19 M by Luxembourg . The European Commission donated further $ 36 M. The most important non-European donor State was Japan ( $ 36 M ) . The number of donors exceeded 180 in one year .
There has been an increasing gulf between the Premier League and the Football League . Since its split with the Football League , many established clubs in the Premier League have managed to distance themselves from their counterparts in lower leagues . Owing in large part to the disparity in revenue from television rights between the leagues , many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in the Premier League . In every season except 2001–02 and 2011–12 , at least one Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League . In 1997–98 all three promoted clubs were relegated at the end of the season .
Prior to the 12th century , women accounted for less than one percent of the world’s Islamic scholars . However , al-Sakhawi and Mohammad Akram Nadwi have since found evidence of over 8,000 female scholars since the 15th century . al-Sakhawi devotes an entire volume of his 12-volume biographical dictionary al-Ḍawʾ al-lāmiʻ to female scholars , giving information on 1,075 of them . More recently , the scholar Mohammad Akram Nadwi , currently a researcher from the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies , has written 40 volumes on the muḥaddithāt ( the women scholars of ḥadīth ) , and found at least 8,000 of them .
On 14 June 1925 , in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera 's dictatorship , the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March . As a reprisal , the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club . This coincided with the transition to professional football , and , in 1926 , the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed , for the first time , to operate a professional football club . On 3 July 1927 , the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara , against the Spanish national team . To kick off the match , local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his airplane . In 1928 , victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled " Oda a Platko " , which was written by a member of the Generation of '27 , Rafael Alberti , inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper , Franz Platko . On 23 June 1929 , Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League . A year after winning the championship , on 30 July 1930 , Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems .
Within each province are communities ( hamaynkner , singular hamaynk ) . Each community is self-governing and consists of one or more settlements ( bnakavayrer , singular bnakavayr ) . Settlements are classified as either towns ( kaghakner , singular kaghak ) or villages ( gyugher , singular gyugh ) . As of 2007 [ update ] , Armenia includes 915 communities , of which 49 are considered urban and 866 are considered rural . The capital , Yerevan , also has the status of a community . Additionally , Yerevan is divided into twelve semi-autonomous districts .
The word " dollar " is one of the words in the first paragraph of Section 9 of Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution . In that context , " dollars " is a reference to the Spanish milled dollar , a coin that had a monetary value of 8 Spanish units of currency , or reales . In 1792 the U.S. Congress adopted legislation titled An act establishing a mint , and regulating the Coins of the United States . Section 9 of that act authorized the production of various coins , including " DOLLARS OR UNITS—each to be of the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current , and to contain three hundred and seventy-one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure , or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver " . Section 20 of the act provided , " That the money of account of the United States shall be expressed in dollars , or units ... and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the United States shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation " . In other words , this act designated the United States dollar as the unit of currency of the United States .
To the extent that Italy held the territory by UN mandate , the trusteeship provisions gave the Somalis the opportunity to gain experience in political education and self-government . These were advantages that British Somaliland , which was to be incorporated into the new Somali state , did not have . Although in the 1950s British colonial officials attempted , through various administrative development efforts , to make up for past neglect , the protectorate stagnated . The disparity between the two territories in economic development and political experience would cause serious difficulties when it came time to integrate the two parts . Meanwhile , in 1948 , under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of the Somalis , the British " returned " the Haud ( an important Somali grazing area that was presumably 'protected ' by British treaties with the Somalis in 1884 and 1886 ) and the Ogaden to Ethiopia , based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which the British ceded Somali territory to the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik in exchange for his help against plundering by Somali clans . Britain included the proviso that the Somali nomads would retain their autonomy , but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over them . This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands it had turned over . Britain also granted administration of the almost exclusively Somali-inhabited Northern Frontier District ( NFD ) to Kenyan nationalists despite an informal plebiscite demonstrating the overwhelming desire of the region 's population to join the newly formed Somali Republic .
The outreach director of HRTR , Susan Prager , is also the communication director of " Friends of Falun Gong " , a quasi-government non-profit funded by fmr . Congressman Tom Lanto 's wife and Ambassador Mark Palmer of NED . A major setback to the event was caused by footballer Diego Maradona , scheduled to open the relay through Buenos Aires , pulling out in an attempt to avoid the Olympic controversy . Trying to avoid the scenes that marred the relay in the UK , France and the US , the city government designed a complex security operative to protect the torch relay , involving 1200 police officers and 3000 other people , including public employees and volunteers . Overall , the protests were peaceful in nature , although there were a few incidents such as the throwing of several water balloons in an attempt to extinguish the Olympic flame , and minor scuffles between Olympic protesters and supporters from Chinese immigrant communities .
Another civil war ensued after the death of Karim Khan in 1779 , out of which Aqa Mohammad Khan emerged , founding the Qajar Dynasty in 1794 . In 1795 , following the disobedience of the Georgian subjects and their alliance with the Russians , the Qajars captured Tblisi by the Battle of Krtsanisi , and drove the Russians out of the entire Caucasus , reestablishing a short-lived Iranian suzerainty over the region . The Russo-Persian wars of 1804–1813 and 1826–1828 resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for Iran in the Caucasus , comprising all of Transcaucasia and Dagestan , which made part of the very concept of Iran for centuries , and thus substantial gains for the neighboring Russian Empire .
Pascal Lissouba , who became Congo 's first elected president ( 1992–1997 ) during the period of multi-party democracy , attempted to implement economic reforms with IMF backing to liberalise the economy . In June 1996 the IMF approved a three-year SDR69.5m ( US $ 100m ) enhanced structural adjustment facility ( ESAF ) and was on the verge of announcing a renewed annual agreement when civil war broke out in Congo in mid-1997 .
The country was controlled by a revolutionary council until 1984 . The first multi-party elections were held in 1994 . An army uprising in May 1998 led to the Guinea-Bissau Civil War and the president 's ousting in June 1999 . Elections were held again in 2000 , and Kumba Ialá was elected president .
Initially , officials were unable to contact the Wolong National Nature Reserve , home to around 280 giant pandas . However , the Foreign Ministry later said that a group of 31 British tourists visiting the Wolong Panda Reserve in the quake-hit area returned safe and uninjured to Chengdu . Nonetheless , the well-being of an even greater number of pandas in the neighbouring panda reserves remained unknown . Five security guards at the reserve were killed by the earthquake . Six pandas escaped after their enclosures were damaged . By May 20 , two pandas at the reserve were found to be injured , while the search continued for another two adult pandas that went missing after the quake . By May 28 , 2008 , one panda was still missing . The missing panda was later found dead under the rubble of an enclosure . Nine-year-old Mao Mao , a mother of five at the breeding center , was discovered on Monday , her body crushed by a wall in her enclosure . Panda keepers and other workers placed her remains in a small wooden crate and buried her outside the breeding centre .
Wang , Štrkalj et al . ( 2003 ) examined the use of race as a biological concept in research papers published in China 's only biological anthropology journal , Acta Anthropologica Sinica . The study showed that the race concept was widely used among Chinese anthropologists . In a 2007 review paper , Štrkalj suggested that the stark contrast of the racial approach between the United States and China was due to the fact that race is a factor for social cohesion among the ethnically diverse people of China , whereas " race " is a very sensitive issue in America and the racial approach is considered to undermine social cohesion - with the result that in the socio-political context of US academics scientists are encouraged not to use racial categories , whereas in China they are encouraged to use them .
Inflammatory diarrhea occurs when there is damage to the mucosal lining or brush border , which leads to a passive loss of protein-rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids . Features of all three of the other types of diarrhea [ clarification needed ] can be found in this type of diarrhea . It can be caused by bacterial infections , viral infections , parasitic infections , or autoimmune problems such as inflammatory bowel diseases . It can also be caused by tuberculosis , colon cancer , and enteritis . [ citation needed ]
The apartheid bureaucracy devised complex ( and often arbitrary ) criteria in the Population Registration Act of 1945 to determine who belonged in which group . Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications . When it was unclear from a person 's physical appearance whether the individual should be considered Coloured or Black , the " pencil test " was used . A pencil was inserted into a person 's hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough to hold the pencil , rather than having it pass through , as it would with smoother hair . If so , the person was classified as Black . Such classifications sometimes divided families .
Japan conscripted many soldiers from its colonies of Korea and Formosa ( Taiwan ) . To a small extent , some Vichy French , Indian National Army , and Burmese National Army forces were active in the area of the Pacific War . Collaborationist units from Hong Kong ( reformed ex-colonial police ) , Philippines , Dutch East Indies ( the PETA ) and Dutch Guinea , British Malaya and British Borneo , Inner Mongolia and former French Indochina ( after the overthrow of Vichy French regime ) as well as Timorese militia also assisted Japanese war efforts .
The club 's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James , and surrounded by two branches , one of a laurel tree and the other a palm . In 1910 the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest . The winner was Carles Comamala , who at the time played for the club . Comamala 's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today , with some minor variations . The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it , and the team colours at the bottom .
Paris ' urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century , particularly where street-front alignment , building height and building distribution is concerned . In recent developments , a 1974-2010 building height limitation of 37 metres ( 121 ft ) was raised to 50 m ( 160 ft ) in central areas and 180 metres ( 590 ft ) in some of Paris ' peripheral quarters , yet for some of the city 's more central quarters , even older building-height laws still remain in effect . The 210 metres ( 690 ft ) Montparnasse tower was both Paris and France 's tallest building until 1973 , but this record has been held by the La Défense quarter Tour First tower in Courbevoie since its 2011 construction . A new project for La Defense , called Hermitage Plaza , launched in 2009 , proposes to build two towers , 85 and 86 stories or 320 metres high , which would be the tallest buildings in the European Union , just slightly shorter than the Eiffel Tower . They were scheduled for completion in 2019 or 2020 , but as of January 2015 construction had not yet begun , and there were questions in the press about the future of the project .
As an example , Santiago de Compostela , the political capital city , has an average of 129 rainy days and 1,362 millimetres ( 53.6 in ) per year ( with just 17 rainy days in the three summer months ) and 2,101 sunlight hours per year , with just 6 days with frosts per year . But the colder city of Lugo , to the east , has an average of 1,759 sunlight hours per year , 117 days with precipitations ( > 1 mm ) totalling 901.54 millimetres ( 35.5 in ) , and 40 days with frosts per year . The more mountainous parts of the provinces of Ourense and Lugo receive significant snowfall during the winter months . The sunniest city is Pontevedra with 2,223 sunny hours per year .
Passenger elevators capacity is related to the available floor space . Generally passenger elevators are available in capacities from 500 to 2,700 kg ( 1,000–6,000 lb ) in 230 kg ( 500 lb ) increments . [ citation needed ] Generally passenger elevators in buildings of eight floors or fewer are hydraulic or electric , which can reach speeds up to 1 m/s ( 200 ft/min ) hydraulic and up to 152 m/min ( 500 ft/min ) electric . In buildings up to ten floors , electric and gearless elevators are likely to have speeds up to 3 m/s ( 500 ft/min ) , and above ten floors speeds range 3 to 10 m/s ( 500–2,000 ft/min ) .

Cardinal Augustin Bea , the head of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity , added at the end of the visit , " Let us move forward in Christ . God wants it . Humanity is waiting for it . " Unmoved by a harsh condemnation by the Congregation of Faith on mixed marriages precisely at this time of the visit , Paul VI and Ramsey appointed a preparatory commission which was to put the common agenda into practice on such issues as mixed marriages . This resulted in a joint Malta declaration , the first joint agreement on the Creed since the Reformation . Paul VI was a good friend of the Anglican Church , which he described as " our beloved sister Church " . This description was unique to Paul and not used by later popes .
The growth , development , and reproduction of organisms relies on cell division , or the process by which a single cell divides into two usually identical daughter cells . This requires first making a duplicate copy of every gene in the genome in a process called DNA replication . :5.2 The copies are made by specialized enzymes known as DNA polymerases , which " read " one strand of the double-helical DNA , known as the template strand , and synthesize a new complementary strand . Because the DNA double helix is held together by base pairing , the sequence of one strand completely specifies the sequence of its complement ; hence only one strand needs to be read by the enzyme to produce a faithful copy . The process of DNA replication is semiconservative ; that is , the copy of the genome inherited by each daughter cell contains one original and one newly synthesized strand of DNA . :5.2
At the time of her accession , the government was led by the Whig prime minister Lord Melbourne , who at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced Queen , who relied on him for advice . Charles Greville supposed that the widowed and childless Melbourne was " passionately fond of her as he might be of his daughter if he had one " , and Victoria probably saw him as a father figure . Her coronation took place on 28 June 1838 at Westminster Abbey . Over 400,000 visitors came to London for the celebrations . She became the first sovereign to take up residence at Buckingham Palace and inherited the revenues of the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall as well as being granted a civil list allowance of £385,000 per year . Financially prudent , she paid off her father 's debts .
Hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals . Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice . These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks , but the gas 's high solubility is a metallurgical problem , contributing to the embrittlement of many metals , complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks .
Opponents argue that the death penalty is not an effective means of deterring crime , risks the execution of the innocent , is unnecessarily barbaric in nature , cheapens human life , and puts a government on the same base moral level as those criminals involved in murder . Furthermore , some opponents argue that the arbitrariness with which it is administered and the systemic influence of racial , socio-economic , geographic , and gender bias on determinations of desert make the current practice of capital punishment immoral and illegitimate .
Due to reciprocity ( discussed above ) the gain of an antenna used for transmitting must be proportional to its effective area when used for receiving . Consider an antenna with no loss , that is , one whose electrical efficiency is 100 % . It can be shown that its effective area averaged over all directions must be equal to λ2/4π , the wavelength squared divided by 4π . Gain is defined such that the average gain over all directions for an antenna with 100 % electrical efficiency is equal to 1 . Therefore , the effective area Aeff in terms of the gain G in a given direction is given by :
There have been instances where a country 's government bans a movie , resulting in the spread of copied videos and DVDs . Romanian-born documentary maker Ilinca Calugareanu wrote a New York Times article telling the story of Irina Margareta Nistor , a narrator for state TV under Nicolae Ceauşescu 's regime . A visitor from the west gave her bootlegged copies of American movies , which she dubbed for secret viewings through Romania . According to the article , she dubbed more than 3,000 movies and became the country 's second-most famous voice after Ceauşescu , even though no one knew her name until many years later .
Most of the subcontinent was conquered by the Maurya Empire during the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE . From the 3rd century BC onwards Prakrit and Pali literature in the north and the Sangam literature in southern India started to flourish . Wootz steel originated in south India in the 3rd century BC and was exported to foreign countries . Various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties for the next 1,500 years , among which the Gupta Empire stands out . This period , witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence , is known as the classical or " Golden Age of India " . During this period , aspects of Indian civilization , administration , culture , and religion ( Hinduism and Buddhism ) spread to much of Asia , while kingdoms in southern India had maritime business links with the Roman Empire from around 77 CE . Indian cultural influence spread over many parts of Southeast Asia which led to the establishment of Indianized kingdoms in Southeast Asia ( Greater India ) .
There is some evidence , in the form of ice cores drilled to about 400 m ( 1,300 ft ) above the water line , that Lake Vostok 's waters may contain microbial life . The frozen surface of the lake shares similarities with Jupiter 's moon , Europa . If life is discovered in Lake Vostok , it would strengthen the argument for the possibility of life on Europa . On 7 February 2008 , a NASA team embarked on a mission to Lake Untersee , searching for extremophiles in its highly alkaline waters . If found , these resilient creatures could further bolster the argument for extraterrestrial life in extremely cold , methane-rich environments .
Osmotic diarrhea occurs when too much water is drawn into the bowels . If a person drinks solutions with excessive sugar or excessive salt , these can draw water from the body into the bowel and cause osmotic diarrhea . Osmotic diarrhea can also be the result of maldigestion ( e.g. , pancreatic disease or Coeliac disease ) , in which the nutrients are left in the lumen to pull in water . Or it can be caused by osmotic laxatives ( which work to alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels ) . In healthy individuals , too much magnesium or vitamin C or undigested lactose can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel . A person who has lactose intolerance can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products . In persons who have fructose malabsorption , excess fructose intake can also cause diarrhea . High-fructose foods that also have a high glucose content are more absorbable and less likely to cause diarrhea . Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol ( often found in sugar-free foods ) are difficult for the body to absorb and , in large amounts , may lead to osmotic diarrhea . In most of these cases , osmotic diarrhea stops when offending agent ( e.g . milk , sorbitol ) is stopped .
Film speed is used in the exposure equations to find the appropriate exposure parameters . Four variables are available to the photographer to obtain the desired effect : lighting , film speed , f-number ( aperture size ) , and shutter speed ( exposure time ) . The equation may be expressed as ratios , or , by taking the logarithm ( base 2 ) of both sides , by addition , using the APEX system , in which every increment of 1 is a doubling of exposure ; this increment is commonly known as a " stop " . The effective f-number is proportional to the ratio between the lens focal length and aperture diameter , the diameter itself being proportional to the square root of the aperture area . Thus , a lens set to f/1.4 allows twice as much light to strike the focal plane as a lens set to f/2 . Therefore , each f-number factor of the square root of two ( approximately 1.4 ) is also a stop , so lenses are typically marked in that progression : f/1.4 , 2 , 2.8 , 4 , 5.6 , 8 , 11 , 16 , 22 , 32 , etc .
The Roman legions first entered the area under Decimus Junius Brutus in 137–136 BC , but the country was only incorporated into the Roman Empire by the time of Augustus ( 29 BC – 19 BC ) . The Romans were interested in Galicia mainly for its mineral resources , most notably gold . Under Roman rule , most Galician hillforts began to be – sometimes forcibly – abandoned , and Gallaeci served frequently in the Roman army as auxiliary troops . Romans brought new technologies , new travel routes , new forms of organizing property , and a new language ; latin . The Roman Empire established its control over Galicia through camps ( castra ) as Aquis Querquennis , Ciadella camp or Lucus Augusti ( Lugo ) , roads ( viae ) and monuments as the lighthouse known as Tower of Hercules , in Corunna , but the remoteness and lesser interest of the country since the 2nd century of our era , when the gold mines stopped being productive , led to a lesser degree of Romanization . In the 3rd century it was made a province , under the name Gallaecia , which included also northern Portugal , Asturias , and a large section of what today is known as Castile and León .
Northwestern was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1917 and remains a research university with " very high " research activity . Northwestern 's schools of management , engineering , and communication are among the most academically productive in the nation . Northwestern received $ 550 million in research funding in 2014 . Northwestern supports nearly 1,500 research laboratories across two campuses , predominately in the medical and biological sciences . Through the Innovation and New Ventures Office ( INVO ) , Northwestern researchers disclosed 247 inventions , filed 270 patents applications , received 81 foreign and US patents , started 12 companies , and generated $ 79.8 million in licensing revenue in 2013 . The bulk of revenue has come from a patent on pregabalin , a synthesized organic molecule discovered by chemistry professor Richard Silverman , which ultimately was marketed as Lyrica , a drug sold by Pfizer , to combat epilepsy , neuropathic pain , and fibromyalgia . INVO has been involved in creating a number of centers , including the Center for Developmental Therapeutics ( CDT ) and the Center for Device Development ( CD2 ) . It has also helped form over 50 Northwestern startup companies based on Northwestern technologies .
The 18th century saw a huge growth in the number of drinking establishments , primarily due to the introduction of gin . Gin was brought to England by the Dutch after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and became very popular after the government created a market for " cuckoo grain " or " cuckoo malt " that was unfit to be used in brewing and distilling by allowing unlicensed gin and beer production , while imposing a heavy duty on all imported spirits . As thousands of gin-shops sprang up all over England , brewers fought back by increasing the number of alehouses . By 1740 the production of gin had increased to six times that of beer and because of its cheapness it became popular with the poor , leading to the so-called Gin Craze . Over half of the 15,000 drinking establishments in London were gin shops .
The emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon . Emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy . The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics . Under certain conditions , it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria , while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug . For example , antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the Luria–Delbrück experiment . Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin , which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains , have become less effective , due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains .
Some researchers believe that the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the 17th century . According to this hypothesis , in 1648 several koches of Semyon Dezhnyov 's expedition came ashore in Alaska by storm and founded this settlement . This hypothesis is based on the testimony of Chukchi geographer Nikolai Daurkin , who had visited Alaska in 1764–1765 and who had reported on a village on the Kheuveren River , populated by " bearded men " who " pray to the icons " . Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with Koyuk River .
Francis Marcus of the International Federation of the Red Cross praised the Chinese rescue effort as " swift and very efficient " in Beijing on Tuesday . But he added the scale of the disaster was such that " we ca n't expect that the government can do everything and handle every aspect of the needs " . The Economist noted that China reacted to the disaster " rapidly and with uncharacteristic openness " , contrasting it with Burma 's secretive response to Cyclone Nargis , which devastated that country 10 days before the earthquake .
Commentaries dealing with the zahir ( outward aspects ) of the text are called tafsir , and hermeneutic and esoteric commentaries dealing with the batin are called ta'wil ( " interpretation " or " explanation " ) , which involves taking the text back to its beginning . Commentators with an esoteric slant believe that the ultimate meaning of the Quran is known only to God . In contrast , Quranic literalism , followed by Salafis and Zahiris , is the belief that the Quran should only be taken at its apparent meaning . [ citation needed ]
As the number and size of agricultural societies increased , they expanded into lands traditionally used by hunter-gatherers . This process of agriculture-driven expansion led to the development of the first forms of government in agricultural centers , such as the Fertile Crescent , Ancient India , Ancient China , Olmec , Sub-Saharan Africa and Norte Chico .
Another work from Ancient Greece that made an early impact on botany is De Materia Medica , a five-volume encyclopedia about herbal medicine written in the middle of the first century by Greek physician and pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides . De Materia Medica was widely read for more than 1,500 years . Important contributions from the medieval Muslim world include Ibn Wahshiyya 's Nabatean Agriculture , Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī 's ( 828–896 ) the Book of Plants , and Ibn Bassal 's The Classification of Soils . In the early 13th century , Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati , and Ibn al-Baitar ( d. 1248 ) wrote on botany in a systematic and scientific manner .
In 1910 , over 2 million children in the same age group were employed in the United States . This included children who rolled cigarettes , engaged in factory work , worked as bobbin doffers in textile mills , worked in coal mines and were employed in canneries . Lewis Hine 's photographs of child labourers in the 1910s powerfully evoked the plight of working children in the American south . Hines took these photographs between 1908 and 1917 as the staff photographer for the National Child Labor Committee .
Among the other phyla , the Ctenophora and the Cnidaria , which includes sea anemones , corals , and jellyfish , are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening , which serves as both the mouth and the anus . Both have distinct tissues , but they are not organized into organs . There are only two main germ layers , the ectoderm and endoderm , with only scattered cells between them . As such , these animals are sometimes called diploblastic . The tiny placozoans are similar , but they do not have a permanent digestive chamber .
The ancestors of modern bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the first forms of life to appear on Earth , about 4 billion years ago . For about 3 billion years , most organisms were microscopic , and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life . In 2008 , fossils of macroorganisms were discovered and named as the Francevillian biota . Although bacterial fossils exist , such as stromatolites , their lack of distinctive morphology prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution , or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species . However , gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial phylogeny , and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage . Bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence , that of the archaea and eukaryotes . Here , eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into endosymbiotic associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells , which were themselves possibly related to the Archaea . This involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of alphaproteobacterial symbionts to form either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes , which are still found in all known Eukarya ( sometimes in highly reduced form , e.g . in ancient " amitochondrial " protozoa ) . Later on , some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed cyanobacterial-like organisms . This led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants . There are also some algae that originated from even later endosymbiotic events . Here , eukaryotes engulfed a eukaryotic algae that developed into a " second-generation " plastid . This is known as secondary endosymbiosis .
Season eight premiered on January 13 , 2009 . Mike Darnell , the president of alternative programming for Fox , stated that the season would focus more on the contestants ' personal life . Much early attention on the show was therefore focused on the widowhood of Danny Gokey . [ citation needed ]
The second presidential debate was held at Washington University in St. Louis , Missouri , on October 8 , moderated by Charles Gibson of ABC . Conducted in a town meeting format , less formal than the first presidential debate , this debate saw Bush and Kerry taking questions on a variety of subjects from a local audience . Bush attempted to deflect criticism of what was described as his scowling demeanor during the first debate , joking at one point about one of Kerry 's remarks , " That answer made me want to scowl . "
In the Soviet Union , in the 1970s , a comparison was made between systems electrified at 3 kV DC and 25 kV AC ( 50 Hz ) . The results showed that percentage losses in the overhead wires ( catenary and contact wires ) was over 3 times greater for 3 kV DC than for 25 kV AC . But when the conversion losses were all taken into account and added to overhead wire losses ( including cooling blower energy ) the 25 kV AC lost a somewhat higher percent of energy than for 3 kV DC . Thus in spite of the much higher losses in the catenary , the 3 kV DC was a little more energy efficient than AC in providing energy from the USSR power grid to the terminals of the traction motors ( all DC at that time ) . While both systems use energy in converting higher voltage AC from the USSR 's power grid to lower voltage DC , the conversions for the DC system all took place ( at higher efficiency ) in the railway substation , while most of the conversion for the AC system took place inside the locomotive ( at lower efficiency ) . Consider also that it takes energy to constantly move this mobile conversion hardware over the rails while the stationary hardware in the railway substation does n't incur this energy cost . For more details see : Wiki : Soviet Union DC vs. AC .
During the earlier medieval period , the vocal music from the liturgical genre , predominantly Gregorian chant , was monophonic , using a single , unaccompanied vocal melody line . Polyphonic vocal genres , which used multiple independent vocal melodies , began to develop during the high medieval era , becoming prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th century .
Programmes , such as the politically fuelled Give My Head Peace ( produced by BBC Northern Ireland ) and the soap opera River City ( produced by BBC Scotland ) , have been created specifically to cater for some viewers in their respective nations , who may have found programmes created for English audiences irrelevant . BBC Scotland produces daily programmes for its Gaelic-speaking viewers , including current affairs , political and children 's programming such as the popular Eòrpa and Dè a-nis ? . BBC Wales also produces a large amount of Welsh language programming for S4C , particularly news , sport and other programmes , especially the soap opera Pobol y Cwm ( 'People of the Valley ' ) . The UK nations also produce a number of programmes that are shown across the UK , such as BBC Scotland 's comedy series Chewin ' the Fat , and BBC Northern Ireland 's talk show Patrick Kielty Almost Live .
In 1845 , Ireland was hit by a potato blight . In the next four years over a million Irish people died and another million emigrated in what became known as the Great Famine . In Ireland , Victoria was labelled " The Famine Queen " . She personally donated £2,000 to famine relief , more than any other individual donor , and also supported the Maynooth Grant to a Roman Catholic seminary in Ireland , despite Protestant opposition . The story that she donated only £5 in aid to the Irish , and on the same day gave the same amount to Battersea Dogs Home , was a myth generated towards the end of the 19th century .
Whitehead has had some influence on philosophy of business administration and organizational theory . This has led in part to a focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events ( as opposed to static things ) within organizations through an “organization studies” discourse that accommodates a variety of 'weak ' and 'strong ' process perspectives from a number of philosophers . One of the leading figures having an explicitly Whiteheadian and panexperientialist stance towards management is Mark Dibben , who works in what he calls " applied process thought " to articulate a philosophy of management and business administration as part of a wider examination of the social sciences through the lens of process metaphysics . For Dibben , this allows " a comprehensive exploration of life as perpetually active experiencing , as opposed to occasional – and thoroughly passive – happening . " Dibben has published two books on applied process thought , Applied Process Thought I : Initial Explorations in Theory and Research ( 2008 ) , and Applied Process Thought II : Following a Trail Ablaze ( 2009 ) , as well as other papers in this vein in the fields of philosophy of management and business ethics .
Last but not least the electric double-layer capacitor ( now Supercapacitors ) were invented . In 1957 H. Becker developed a " Low voltage electrolytic capacitor with porous carbon electrodes " . He believed that the energy was stored as a charge in the carbon pores used in his capacitor as in the pores of the etched foils of electrolytic capacitors . Because the double layer mechanism was not known by him at the time , he wrote in the patent : " It is not known exactly what is taking place in the component if it is used for energy storage , but it leads to an extremely high capacity . " .
Flora Gomes is an internationally renowned film director ; his most famous film is Nha Fala ( English : My Voice ) . Gomes 's Mortu Nega ( Death Denied ) ( 1988 ) was the first fiction film and the second feature film ever made in Guinea-Bissau . ( The first feature film was N’tturudu , by director Umban u’Kest in 1987 . ) At FESPACO 1989 , Mortu Nega won the prestigious Oumarou Ganda Prize . Mortu Nega is in Creole with English subtitles . In 1992 , Gomes directed Udju Azul di Yonta , which was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival . Gomes has also served on the boards of many Africa-centric film festivals .
Greek culture has evolved over thousands of years , with its beginning in the Mycenaean civilization , continuing through the Classical period , the Roman and Eastern Roman periods and was profoundly affected by Christianity , which it in turn influenced and shaped . Ottoman Greeks had to endure through several centuries of adversity that culminated in genocide in the 20th century but nevertheless included cultural exchanges and enriched both cultures . The Diafotismos is credited with revitalizing Greek culture and giving birth to the synthesis of ancient and medieval elements that characterize it today .
The marriage of Richard II of England to Anne of Bohemia established contacts between the two nations and brought Lollard ideas to her homeland . The teachings of the Czech priest Jan Hus were based on those of John Wycliffe , yet his followers , the Hussites , were to have a much greater political impact than the Lollards . Hus gained a great following in Bohemia , and in 1414 , he was requested to appear at the Council of Constance to defend his cause . When he was burned as a heretic in 1415 , it caused a popular uprising in the Czech lands . The subsequent Hussite Wars fell apart due to internal quarrels and did not result in religious or national independence for the Czechs , but both the Catholic Church and the German element within the country were weakened .
Somali scholars have for centuries produced many notable examples of Islamic literature ranging from poetry to Hadith . With the adoption of the Latin alphabet in 1972 to transcribe the Somali language , numerous contemporary Somali authors have also released novels , some of which have gone on to receive worldwide acclaim . Of these modern writers , Nuruddin Farah is probably the most celebrated . Books such as From a Crooked Rib and Links are considered important literary achievements , works which have earned Farah , among other accolades , the 1998 Neustadt International Prize for Literature . Farah Mohamed Jama Awl is another prominent Somali writer who is perhaps best known for his Dervish era novel , Ignorance is the enemy of love . Young upstart Nadifa Mohamed was also awarded the 2010 Betty Trask Prize . Additionally , Mohamed Ibrahim Warsame 'Hadrawi ' is considered by many to be the greatest living Somali poet , and several of his works have been translated internationally .
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had a mother who was a dark-skinned Nubian Sudanese woman and a father who was a lighter-skinned Egyptian . In response to an advertisement for an acting position , as a young man he said , " I am not white but I am not exactly black either . My blackness is tending to reddish " .
The United States took control of the island in the 1898 Spanish–American War , as part of the Treaty of Paris . Guam was transferred to U.S. Navy control on 23 December 1898 by Executive Order 108-A . Guam came to serve as a station for American ships traveling to and from the Philippines , while the Northern Mariana Islands passed to Germany , and then to Japan . A U.S. Navy yard was established at Piti in 1899 , and a marine barracks at Sumay in 1901.:13 Following the Philippine–American War , Emilio Aguinaldo and Apolinario Mabini were exiled on Guam in 1901. : vi

Paris today has more than 421 municipal parks and gardens , covering more than 3,000 hectares and containing more than 250,000 trees . Two of Paris ' oldest and most famous gardens are the Tuileries Garden , created in 1564 for the Tuileries Palace , and redone by André Le Nôtre between 1664 and 1672 , and the Luxembourg Garden , for the Luxembourg Palace , built for Marie de ' Medici in 1612 , which today houses the French Senate . The Jardin des Plantes was the first botanical garden in Paris , created in 1626 by Louis XIII 's doctor Guy de La Brosse for the cultivation of medicinal plants .
Also on the north side is the suburban community of Catalina Foothills , located in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains just north of the city limits . This community includes among the area 's most expensive homes , sometimes multimillion-dollar estates . The Foothills area is generally defined as north of River Road , east of Oracle Road , and west of Sabino Creek . Some of the Tucson area 's major resorts are located in the Catalina Foothills , including the Hacienda Del Sol , Westin La Paloma Resort , Loews Ventana Canyon Resort and Canyon Ranch Resort . La Encantada , an upscale outdoor shopping mall , is also in the Foothills .
Focused by the commitment to a Moon landing , in January 1962 the US announced Project Gemini , a two-man spacecraft that would support the later three-man Apollo by developing the key spaceflight technologies of space rendezvous and docking of two craft , flight durations of sufficient length to simulate going to the Moon and back , and extra-vehicular activity to accomplish useful work outside the spacecraft .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has stated that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose , which can cause anosmia . Reports of anosmia were also observed in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections . On June 16 , 2009 , the FDA said that consumers should stop using zinc-based intranasal cold products and ordered their removal from store shelves . The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell can not detect leaking gas or smoke and can not tell if food has spoiled before they eat it . Recent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a potent heat shock response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of PARP-dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes .
Measurement of light or photometry is generally concerned with the amount of useful light falling on a surface and the amount of light emerging from a lamp or other source , along with the colors that can be rendered by this light . The human eye responds differently to light from different parts of the visible spectrum , therefore photometric measurements must take the luminosity function into account when measuring the amount of useful light . The basic SI unit of measurement is the candela ( cd ) , which describes the luminous intensity , all other photometric units are derived from the candela . Luminance for instance is a measure of the density of luminous intensity in a given direction . It describes the amount of light that passes through or is emitted from a particular area , and falls within a given solid angle . The SI unit for luminance is candela per square metre ( cd/m2 ) . The CGS unit of luminance is the stilb , which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10 kcd/m2 . The amount of useful light emitted from a source or the luminous flux is measured in lumen ( lm ) .
The original early 19th-century interior designs , many of which survive , include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis , on the advice of Sir Charles Long . King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle Époque cream and gold colour scheme . Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House . The palace has 775 rooms , and the garden is the largest private garden in London . The state rooms , used for official and state entertaining , are open to the public each year for most of August and September , and on selected days in winter and spring .
Morality plays emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished until 1550 . The most interesting morality play is The Castle of Perseverance which depicts mankind 's progress from birth to death . However , the most famous morality play and perhaps best known medieval drama is Everyman . Everyman receives Death 's summons , struggles to escape and finally resigns himself to necessity . Along the way , he is deserted by Kindred , Goods , and Fellowship - only Good Deeds goes with him to the grave .
However , according to research firm NPD , sales of devices running Windows in the United States have declined 21 percent compared to the same time period in 2011 . As the holiday shopping season wrapped up , Windows 8 sales continued to lag , even as Apple reported brisk sales . The market research firm IDC reported an overall drop in PC sales for the quarter , and said the drop may have been partly due to consumer reluctance to embrace the new features of the OS and poor support from OEM for these features . This capped the first year of declining PC sales to the Asia Pacific region , as consumers bought more mobile devices than Windows PCs .
The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy , the only few surviving representative texts being those of Menander ( born 342/1 BCE ) . Only one play , Dyskolos , survives in its entirety . The plots of this new Hellenistic comedy of manners were more domestic and formulaic , stereotypical low born characters such as slaves became more important , the language was colloquial and major motifs included escapism , marriage , romance and luck ( Tyche ) . Though no Hellenistic tragedy remains intact , they were still widely produced during the period , yet it seems that there was no major breakthrough in style , remaining within the classical model . The Supplementum Hellenisticum , a modern collection of extant fragments , contains the fragments of 150 authors .
Capacitors deviate from the ideal capacitor equation in a number of ways . Some of these , such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear , or can be assumed to be linear , and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of the capacitor . The usual methods of network analysis can then be applied . In other cases , such as with breakdown voltage , the effect is non-linear and normal ( i.e. , linear ) network analysis can not be used , the effect must be dealt with separately . There is yet another group , which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant . Such an example is temperature dependence . Finally , combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance , resistance , or dielectric losses can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation .
The Polish nobility differed in many respects from the nobility of other countries . The most important difference was that , while in most European countries the nobility lost power as the ruler strove for absolute monarchy , in Poland the reverse process occurred : the nobility actually gained power at the expense of the king , and the political system evolved into an oligarchy .
Horizontal gene transfer refers to the transfer of genetic material through a mechanism other than reproduction . This mechanism is a common source of new genes in prokaryotes , sometimes thought to contribute more to genetic variation than gene duplication . It is a common means of spreading antibiotic resistance , virulence , and adaptive metabolic functions . Although horizontal gene transfer is rare in eukaryotes , likely examples have been identified of protist and alga genomes containing genes of bacterial origin .
Dutch vocabulary is predominantly Germanic in origin , with an additional share of loanwords of 20 % . The main foreign influence on Dutch vocabulary since the 12th century and culminating in the French period has been French and ( northern ) French , accounting for an estimated 6.8 % , or more than a third of all loanwords . Latin , that has been spoken for centuries in the south of the Low Countries , and has since then for centuries plaid a major role as the language of science and religion , follows with 6.1 % . High German and Low German , influential until the mid of the 19th century , account for 2.7 % , but are mostly unrecognizable since many German loanwords have been " Dutchified " , e.g . German " Fremdling " become Dutch " vreemdeling " . From English , Dutch has taken over words since the middle of the 19th century , as a consequence of the gaining power of Britain and the United States . The share of English loanwords is about 1.5 % , but this number is still on the increase . Conversely , Dutch contributed many loanwords to English , accounting for 1.3 % .
In the 1960s , the first Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed , and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time . The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China , having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise . Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968 , the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 metres on the upper deck , with approximately 1,580 metres spanning the river itself . Since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built . Going in the downstream direction , the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are : Dashengguan Bridge , Line 10 Metro Tunnel , Third Bridge , Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel , First Bridge , Second Bridge and Fourth Bridge .
In August 2008 , West revealed plans to open 10 Fatburger restaurants in the Chicago area ; the first was set to open in September 2008 in Orland Park . The second followed in January 2009 , while a third location is yet to be revealed , although the process is being finalized . His company , KW Foods LLC , bought the rights to the chain in Chicago . Ultimately , in 2009 , only two locations actually opened . In February 2011 , West shut down the Fatburger located in Orland Park . Later that year , the remaining Beverly location also was shuttered .
There were 13 finalists this season , but two were eliminated in the first result show of the finals . A new feature introduced was the " Judges ' Save " , and Matt Giraud was saved from elimination at the top seven by the judges when he received the fewest votes . The next week , Lil Rounds and Anoop Desai were eliminated .
The most prominent struggle for power was the conflict that erupted after the death of Yaroslav the Wise . The rivaling Principality of Polotsk was contesting the power of the Grand Prince by occupying Novgorod , while Rostislav Vladimirovich was fighting for the Black Sea port of Tmutarakan belonging to Chernihiv . [ citation needed ] Three of Yaroslav 's sons that first allied together found themselves fighting each other especially after their defeat to the Cuman forces in 1068 at the Battle of the Alta River . At the same time an uprising took place in Kiev , bringing to power Vseslav of Polotsk who supported the traditional Slavic paganism .

On the initiative of Vladimir II Monomakh in 1097 the first federal council of Kievan Rus took place near Chernihiv ] in the city of Liubech with the main intention to find an understanding among the fighting sides . However even though that did not really stop the fighting , it certainly cooled things off . [ citation needed ]
In the 20th century , new types of glass such as laminated glass , reinforced glass and glass bricks have increased the use of glass as a building material and resulted in new applications of glass . Multi-storey buildings are frequently constructed with curtain walls made almost entirely of glass . Similarly , laminated glass has been widely applied to vehicles for windscreens . While glass containers have always been used for storage and are valued for their hygienic properties , glass has been utilized increasingly in industry . Optical glass for spectacles has been used since the late Middle Ages . The production of lenses has become increasingly proficient , aiding astronomers as well as having other application in medicine and science . Glass is also employed as the aperture cover in many solar energy systems .
Katō Kiyomasa was one of the most powerful and well-known lords of the Sengoku Era . He commanded most of Japan 's major clans during the invasion of Korea ( 1592–1598 ) . In a handbook he addressed to " all samurai , regardless of rank " he told his followers that a warrior 's only duty in life was to " ... grasp the long and the short swords and to die " . He also ordered his followers to put forth great effort in studying the military classics , especially those related to loyalty and filial piety . He is best known for his quote : " If a man does not investigate into the matter of Bushido daily , it will be difficult for him to die a brave and manly death . Thus it is essential to engrave this business of the warrior into one 's mind well . "
During the Hungnam evacuation , about 193 shiploads of UN Command forces and matériel ( approximately 105,000 soldiers , 98,000 civilians , 17,500 vehicles , and 350,000 tons of supplies ) were evacuated to Pusan . The SS Meredith Victory was noted for evacuating 14,000 refugees , the largest rescue operation by a single ship , even though it was designed to hold 12 passengers . Before escaping , the UN Command forces razed most of Hungnam city , especially the port facilities ; and on 16 December 1950 , President Truman declared a national emergency with Presidential Proclamation No . 2914 , 3 C.F.R . 99 ( 1953 ) , which remained in force until 14 September 1978 . [ b ] The next day ( 17 December 1950 ) Kim Il-sung was deprived of the right of command of KPA by China . After that , the leading part of the war became the Chinese army . Following that , on 1 February 1951 , United Nations General Assembly adopted a draft resolution condemning China as an aggressor in the Korean War .
The name of the winning team is engraved on the silver band around the base as soon as the final has finished , in order to be ready in time for the presentation ceremony . This means the engraver has just five minutes to perform a task which would take twenty under normal conditions , although time is saved by engraving the year on during the match , and sketching the presumed winner . During the final , the trophy wears is decorated with ribbons in the colours of both finalists , with the loser 's ribbons being removed at the end of the game . Traditionally , at Wembley finals , the presentation is made at the Royal Box , with players , led by the captain , mounting a staircase to a gangway in front of the box and returning by a second staircase on the other side of the box . At Cardiff the presentation was made on a podium on the pitch .
Reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication . Literary analysis of it is sparse , considering the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education . Author Mary McDonough Murphy , who collected individual impressions of To Kill a Mockingbird by several authors and public figures , calls the book , " an astonishing phenomenon " . In 2006 , British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one " every adult should read before they die " . It was adapted into an Oscar-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan , with a screenplay by Horton Foote . Since 1990 , a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee 's hometown of Monroeville , Alabama .
Gaddafi financially supported other militant groups across the world , including the Black Panther Party , Nation of Islam , Tupamaros , 19th of April Movement and Sandinista National Liberation Front in the Americas , the ANC among other liberation movements in the fight against Apartheid in South Africa , the Provisional Irish Republican Army , ETA , Sardinian nationalists , Action directe , the Red Brigades , and the Red Army Faction in Europe , and the Armenian Secret Army , Japanese Red Army , Free Aceh Movement , and Moro National Liberation Front in Asia . Gaddafi was indiscriminate in the causes he funded , sometimes switching from supporting one side in a conflict to the other , as in the Eritrean War of Independence . Throughout the 1970s these groups received financial support from Libya , which came to be seen as a leader in the Third World 's struggle against colonialism and neocolonialism . Though many of these groups were labelled " terrorists " by critics of their activities , Gaddafi rejected such a characterisation , instead considering them revolutionaries engaged in liberation struggles .
The earliest confirmed evidence of the Chinese script yet discovered is the body of inscriptions on oracle bones from the late Shang dynasty ( c. 1200–1050 BC ) . These symbols , carved on pieces of bone and turtle shell being sold as " dragon bones " for medicinal purposes , were identified as Chinese writing by scholars in 1899 . By 1928 , the source of the oracle bones had been traced to a village near Anyang in Henan Province , which was excavated by the Academia Sinica between 1928 and 1937 . Over 150,000 fragments have been found .
In 2003 , Nintendo announced that a new The Legend of Zelda game was in the works for the GameCube by the same team that had created the cel-shaded The Wind Waker . At the following year 's Game Developers Conference , director Eiji Aonuma unintentionally revealed that the game 's sequel was in development under the working title The Wind Waker 2 ; it was set to use a similar graphical style to that of its predecessor . Nintendo of America told Aonuma that North American sales of The Wind Waker were sluggish because its cartoon appearance created the impression that the game was designed for a young audience . Concerned that the sequel would have the same problem , Aonuma expressed to producer Shigeru Miyamoto that he wanted to create a realistic Zelda game that would appeal to the North American market . Miyamoto , hesitant about solely changing the game 's presentation , suggested the team 's focus should instead be on coming up with gameplay innovations . He advised that Aonuma should start by doing what could not be done in Ocarina of Time , particularly horseback combat . [ l ]
In 1976 the future Labour prime minister James Callaghan launched what became known as the 'great debate ' on the education system . He went on to list the areas he felt needed closest scrutiny : the case for a core curriculum , the validity and use of informal teaching methods , the role of school inspection and the future of the examination system . Comprehensive school remains the most common type of state secondary school in England , and the only type in Wales . They account for around 90 % of pupils , or 64 % if one does not count schools with low-level selection . This figure varies by region .
Greece has universal compulsory military service for males , while females are exempted from conscription but may otherwise serve in the military . As of 2009 [ update ] , mandatory military service is nine months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45 . Additionally , Greek males between the age of 18 and 60 who live in strategically sensitive areas may be required to serve part-time in the National Guard . However , as the military has sought to become a completely professional force , the government has promised to reduce mandatory military service or abolish it completely .
World Trade Center Montevideo officially opened in 1998 , although work is still ongoing as of 2010 [ update ] . The complex is composed of three towers , two three-story buildings called World Trade Center Plaza and World Trade Center Avenue and a large central square called Towers Square . World Trade Center 1 was the first building to be inaugurated , in 1998 . [ citation needed ] It has 22 floors and 17,100 square metres of space . That same year the avenue and the auditorium were raised . World Trade Center 2 was inaugurated in 2002 , a twin tower of World Trade Center 1 .

Traditionally , Switzerland avoids alliances that might entail military , political , or direct economic action and has been neutral since the end of its expansion in 1515 . Its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 . Only in 2002 did Switzerland become a full member of the United Nations and it was the first state to join it by referendum . Switzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and historically has served as an intermediary between other states . Switzerland is not a member of the European Union ; the Swiss people have consistently rejected membership since the early 1990s . However , Switzerland does participate in the Schengen Area .

In 1661 another Jesuit , Johann Grueber , crossed Tibet from Sining to Lhasa ( where he spent a month ) , before heading on to Nepal . He was followed by others who actually built a church in Lhasa . These included the Jesuit Father Ippolito Desideri , 1716–1721 , who gained a deep knowledge of Tibetan culture , language and Buddhism , and various Capuchins in 1707–1711 , 1716–1733 and 1741–1745 , Christianity was used by some Tibetan monarchs and their courts and the Karmapa sect lamas to counterbalance the influence of the Gelugpa sect in the 17th century until in 1745 when all the missionaries were expelled at the lama 's insistence .
Detroit has four border crossings : the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel provide motor vehicle thoroughfares , with the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel providing railroad access to and from Canada . The fourth border crossing is the Detroit–Windsor Truck Ferry , located near the Windsor Salt Mine and Zug Island . Near Zug Island , the southwest part of the city was developed over a 1,500-acre ( 610 ha ) salt mine that is 1,100 feet ( 340 m ) below the surface . The Detroit Salt Company mine has over 100 miles ( 160 km ) of roads within .
On 24 August , Pravda and Izvestia carried news of the non-secret portions of the Pact , complete with the now infamous front-page picture of Molotov signing the treaty , with a smiling Stalin looking on . The news was met with utter shock and surprise by government leaders and media worldwide , most of whom were aware only of the British–French–Soviet negotiations that had taken place for months . The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was received with shock by Nazi Germany 's allies , notably Japan , by the Comintern and foreign communist parties , and by Jewish communities all around the world . So , that day , German diplomat Hans von Herwarth , whose grandmother was Jewish , informed Guido Relli , an Italian diplomat , and American chargé d'affaires Charles Bohlen on the secret protocol regarding vital interests in the countries ' allotted " spheres of influence " , without revealing the annexation rights for " territorial and political rearrangement " .
During most of the Neolithic age of Eurasia , people lived in small tribes composed of multiple bands or lineages . There is little scientific evidence of developed social stratification in most Neolithic societies ; social stratification is more associated with the later Bronze Age . Although some late Eurasian Neolithic societies formed complex stratified chiefdoms or even states , states evolved in Eurasia only with the rise of metallurgy , and most Neolithic societies on the whole were relatively simple and egalitarian . Beyond Eurasia , however , states were formed during the local Neolithic in three areas , namely in the Preceramic Andes with the Norte Chico Civilization , Formative Mesoamerica and Ancient Hawaiʻi . However , most Neolithic societies were noticeably more hierarchical than the Paleolithic cultures that preceded them and hunter-gatherer cultures in general .
With the growing possibility of an Allied invasion in the Balkans , the Axis began to divert more resources to the destruction of the Partisans main force and its high command . This meant , among other things , a concerted German effort to capture Josip Broz Tito personally . On 25 May 1944 , he managed to evade the Germans after the Raid on Drvar ( Operation Rösselsprung ) , an airborne assault outside his Drvar headquarters in Bosnia .
Early HDTV commercial experiments , such as NHK 's MUSE , required over four times the bandwidth of a standard-definition broadcast . Despite efforts made to reduce analog HDTV to about twice the bandwidth of SDTV , these television formats were still distributable only by satellite .
Poultry ( /ˌpoʊltriː/ ) are domesticated birds kept by humans for the eggs they produce , their meat , their feathers , or sometimes as pets . These birds are most typically members of the superorder Galloanserae ( fowl ) , especially the order Galliformes ( which includes chickens , quails and turkeys ) and the family Anatidae , in order Anseriformes , commonly known as " waterfowl " and including domestic ducks and domestic geese . Poultry also includes other birds that are killed for their meat , such as the young of pigeons ( known as squabs ) but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game . The word " poultry " comes from the French/Norman word poule , itself derived from the Latin word pullus , which means small animal .
In order to enlist Stalin 's support , Zhou and a Chinese delegation left for Moscow on 8 October , arriving there on 10 October at which point they flew to Stalin 's home at the Black Sea . There they conferred with the top Soviet leadership which included Joseph Stalin as well as Vyacheslav Molotov , Lavrentiy Beria and Georgi Malenkov . Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition , but warned Zhou that the Soviet Union 's air force would need two or three months to prepare any operations . In a subsequent meeting , Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis , and that the Soviet air force would only operate over Chinese airspace , and only after an undisclosed period of time . Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951 . Mao did not find Soviet air support especially useful , as the fighting was going to take place on the south side of the Yalu . Soviet shipments of matériel , when they did arrive , were limited to small quantities of trucks , grenades , machine guns , and the like .
During the late 19th Century the Jadidists established themselves as an Islamic social movement throughout the region . Although the Jadidists were pro-modernization and not necessarily anti-Russian the Russians viewed the movement as a threat . [ citation needed ] Russian troops were required to restore order during uprisings against the Khanate of Kokand between 1910 and 1913 . Further violence occurred in July 1916 when demonstrators attacked Russian soldiers in Khujand over the threat of forced conscription during World War I . Despite Russian troops quickly bringing Khujand back under control , clashes continued throughout the year in various locations in Tajikistan . [ citation needed ]
One-third of the world 's population is thought to be infected with TB . New infections occur in about 1 % of the population each year . In 2014 , there were 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.5 million deaths . More than 95 % of deaths occurred in developing countries . The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000 . About 80 % of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 5–10 % of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test . Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times .
Under the Capetian dynasty France slowly began to expand its authority over the nobility , growing out of the Île-de-France to exert control over more of the country in the 11th and 12th centuries . They faced a powerful rival in the Dukes of Normandy , who in 1066 under William the Conqueror ( duke 1035–1087 ) , conquered England ( r. 1066–87 ) and created a cross-channel empire that lasted , in various forms , throughout the rest of the Middle Ages . Normans also settled in Sicily and southern Italy , when Robert Guiscard ( d. 1085 ) landed there in 1059 and established a duchy that later became the Kingdom of Sicily . Under the Angevin dynasty of Henry II ( r. 1154–89 ) and his son Richard I ( r. 1189–99 ) , the kings of England ruled over England and large areas of France , [ W ] brought to the family by Henry II 's marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine ( d. 1204 ) , heiress to much of southern France . [ X ] Richard 's younger brother John ( r. 1199–1216 ) lost Normandy and the rest of the northern French possessions in 1204 to the French King Philip II Augustus ( r. 1180–1223 ) . This led to dissension among the English nobility , while John 's financial exactions to pay for his unsuccessful attempts to regain Normandy led in 1215 to Magna Carta , a charter that confirmed the rights and privileges of free men in England . Under Henry III ( r. 1216–72 ) , John 's son , further concessions were made to the nobility , and royal power was diminished . The French monarchy continued to make gains against the nobility during the late 12th and 13th centuries , bringing more territories within the kingdom under their personal rule and centralising the royal administration . Under Louis IX ( r. 1226–70 ) , royal prestige rose to new heights as Louis served as a mediator for most of Europe . [ Y ]
In 1919 , following the Treaty of Versailles , the city was restituted to France in accordance with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson 's " Fourteen Points " without a referendum . The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day . It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France 's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections . The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871 . The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag ; those elected were called " les députés protestataires " , and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890 , they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German parliament demanding the return of those territories to France . At the last Reichstag election in Strasbourg and its periphery , the clear winners were the Social Democrats ; the city was the administrative capital of the region , was inhabited by many Germans appointed by the central government in Berlin and its flourishing economy attracted many Germans . This could explain the difference between the rural vote and the one in Strasbourg . After the war , many Germans left Strasbourg and went back to Germany ; some of them were denounced by the locals or expelled by the newly appointed authorities . The Saverne Affair was vivid in the memory among the Alsatians .
While the Downtown and New Center areas contain high-rise buildings , the majority of the surrounding city consists of low-rise structures and single-family homes . Outside of the city 's core , residential high-rises are found in upper-class neighborhoods such as the East Riverfront extending toward Grosse Pointe and the Palmer Park neighborhood just west of Woodward . The University Commons-Palmer Park district in northwest Detroit , near the University of Detroit Mercy and Marygrove College , anchors historic neighborhoods including Palmer Woods , Sherwood Forest , and the University District .
The Spanish language is the second most spoken language in the United States . There are 45 million Hispanophones who speak Spanish as a first or second language in the United States , as well as six million Spanish language students . Together , this makes the United States of America the second largest Hispanophone country in the world after Mexico , and with the United States having more Spanish-speakers than Colombia and Spain ( but fewer first language speakers ) . Spanish is the Romance language and the Indo-European language with the largest number of native speakers in the world . Roughly half of all American Spanish-speakers also speak English " very well , " based on their self-assessment in the U.S. Census .
There is no clear mechanism by which these local trade organisations became today 's Masonic Lodges , but the earliest rituals and passwords known , from operative lodges around the turn of the 17th–18th centuries , show continuity with the rituals developed in the later 18th century by accepted or speculative Masons , as those members who did not practice the physical craft came to be known . The minutes of the Lodge of Edinburgh ( Mary 's Chapel ) No . 1 in Scotland show a continuity from an operative lodge in 1598 to a modern speculative Lodge . It is reputed to be the oldest Masonic Lodge in the world .
The song was released as a digital download on 25 September 2015 . It received mixed reviews from critics and fans , particularly in comparison to Adele 's " Skyfall " . The mixed reception to the song led to Shirley Bassey trending on Twitter on the day it was released . It became the first Bond theme to reach number one in the UK Singles Chart . The English band Radiohead also composed a song for the film , which went unused .
Although Greg argued that an editor should be free to use his judgment to choose between competing substantive readings , he suggested that an editor should defer to the copy-text when " the claims of two readings ... appear to be exactly balanced . ... In such a case , while there can be no logical reason for giving preference to the copy-text , in practice , if there is no reason for altering its reading , the obvious thing seems to be to let it stand . " The " exactly balanced " variants are said to be indifferent .
According to the Framework Law ( 3549/2007 ) , Public higher education " Highest Educational Institutions " ( Ανώτατα Εκπαιδευτικά Ιδρύματα , Anótata Ekpaideytiká Idrýmata , " ΑΕΙ " ) consists of two parallel sectors : the University sector ( Universities , Polytechnics , Fine Arts Schools , the Open University ) and the Technological sector ( Technological Education Institutions ( TEI ) and the School of Pedagogic and Technological Education ) . There are also State Non-University Tertiary Institutes offering vocationally oriented courses of shorter duration ( 2 to 3 years ) which operate under the authority of other Ministries . Students are admitted to these Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place after completion of the third grade of Lykeio . Additionally , students over twenty-two years old may be admitted to the Hellenic Open University through a form of lottery . The Capodistrian University of Athens is the oldest university in the eastern Mediterranean .
Some examples of social and religious transition ceremonies that can be found in the U.S. , as well as in other cultures around the world , are Confirmation , Bar and Bat Mitzvahs , Quinceañeras , sweet sixteens , cotillions , and débutante balls . In other countries , initiation ceremonies play an important role , marking the transition into adulthood or the entrance into adolescence . This transition may be accompanied by obvious physical changes , which can vary from a change in clothing to tattoos and scarification . Furthermore , transitions into adulthood may also vary by gender , and specific rituals may be more common for males or for females . This illuminates the extent to which adolescence is , at least in part , a social construction ; it takes shape differently depending on the cultural context , and may be enforced more by cultural practices or transitions than by universal chemical or biological physical changes .
Sectional tensions had long existed between the states located north of the Mason–Dixon line and those south of it , primarily centered on the " peculiar institution " of slavery and the ability of states to overrule the decisions of the national government . During the 1840s and 1850s , conflicts between the two sides became progressively more violent . After the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 ( who southerners thought would work to end slavery ) states in the South seceded from the United States , beginning with South Carolina in late 1860 . On April 12 , 1861 , forces of the South ( known as the Confederate States of America or simply the Confederacy ) opened fire on Fort Sumter , whose garrison was loyal to the Union .
In 2008 [ update ] the total number of full-time equivalent jobs was 125,037 . The number of jobs in the primary sector was 203 , of which 184 were in agriculture and 19 were in forestry or lumber production . The number of jobs in the secondary sector was 15,476 of which 7,650 or ( 49.4 % ) were in manufacturing , 51 or ( 0.3 % ) were in mining and 6,389 ( 41.3 % ) were in construction .

The CJK ideographs currently have codes only for their precomposed form . Still , most of those ideographs comprise simpler elements ( often called radicals in English ) , so in principle , Unicode could have decomposed them , as it did with Hangul . This would have greatly reduced the number of required code points , while allowing the display of virtually every conceivable ideograph ( which might do away with some of the problems caused by Han unification ) . A similar idea is used by some input methods , such as Cangjie and Wubi . However , attempts to do this for character encoding have stumbled over the fact that ideographs do not decompose as simply or as regularly as Hangul does .
In the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) , which uses traditional Chinese characters , the Ministry of Education 's Chángyòng Guózì Biāozhǔn Zìtǐ Biǎo ( 常用國字標準字體表 , Chart of Standard Forms of Common National Characters ) lists 4,808 characters ; the Cì Chángyòng Guózì Biāozhǔn Zìtǐ Biǎo ( 次常用國字標準字體表 , Chart of Standard Forms of Less-Than-Common National Characters ) lists another 6,341 characters . The Chinese Standard Interchange Code ( CNS11643 ) —the official national encoding standard—supports 48,027 characters , while the most widely used encoding scheme , BIG-5 , supports only 13,053 .
In April 1994 , the results of a Merck-sponsored study , the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study , were announced . Researchers tested simvastatin , later sold by Merck as Zocor , on 4,444 patients with high cholesterol and heart disease . After five years , the study concluded the patients saw a 35 % reduction in their cholesterol , and their chances of dying of a heart attack were reduced by 42 % . In 1995 , Zocor and Mevacor both made Merck over US $ 1 billion . Endo was awarded the 2006 Japan Prize , and the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 2008 . For his " pioneering research into a new class of molecules " for " lowering cholesterol , " [ sentence fragment ]
Over the course of thousands of years , American indigenous peoples domesticated , bred and cultivated a large array of plant species . These species now constitute 50–60 % of all crops in cultivation worldwide . In certain cases , the indigenous peoples developed entirely new species and strains through artificial selection , as was the case in the domestication and breeding of maize from wild teosinte grasses in the valleys of southern Mexico . Numerous such agricultural products retain their native names in the English and Spanish lexicons .
Chopin 's tombstone , featuring the muse of music , Euterpe , weeping over a broken lyre , was designed and sculpted by Clésinger . The expenses of the funeral and monument , amounting to 5,000 francs , were covered by Jane Stirling , who also paid for the return of the composer 's sister Ludwika to Warsaw . Ludwika took Chopin 's heart in an urn , preserved in alcohol , back to Poland in 1850 . [ n 9 ] She also took a collection of two hundred letters from Sand to Chopin ; after 1851 these were returned to Sand , who seems to have destroyed them .
Portugal lost much of its wealth and status with the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake , occupation during the Napoleonic Wars , and the independence of Brazil , its wealthiest colony , in 1822 . After the 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy , the democratic but unstable Portuguese First Republic was established , later being superseded by the " Estado Novo " right-wing authoritarian regime . Democracy was restored after the Portuguese Colonial War and the Carnation Revolution in 1974 . Shortly after , independence was granted to all its colonies , with the exception of Macau , which was handed over to China in 1999 . This marked the end of the longest-lived European colonial empire , leaving a profound cultural and architectural influence across the globe and a legacy of over 250 million Portuguese speakers today .
The Maya writing system ( often called hieroglyphs from a superficial resemblance to the Ancient Egyptian writing ) was a combination of phonetic symbols and logograms . It is most often classified as a logographic or ( more properly ) a logosyllabic writing system , in which syllabic signs play a significant role . It is the only pre-Columbian writing system known to represent completely the spoken language of its community . In total , the script has more than one thousand different glyphs although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities . At any one time , no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use , some two hundred of which ( including variations ) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation .
Local associations of a special kind are an amalgamation of one or more Landkreise with one or more Kreisfreie Städte to form a replacement of the aforementioned administrative entities at the district level . They are intended to implement simplification of administration at that level . Typically , a district-free city or town and its urban hinterland are grouped into such an association , or Kommunalverband besonderer Art . Such an organization requires the issuing of special laws by the governing state , since they are not covered by the normal administrative structure of the respective states .
The historian Piers Brendon asserts that Burke laid the moral foundations for the British Empire , epitomised in the trial of Warren Hastings , that was ultimately to be its undoing : when Burke stated that " The British Empire must be governed on a plan of freedom , for it will be governed by no other " , this was " ... an ideological bacillus that would prove fatal . This was Edmund Burke 's paternalistic doctrine that colonial government was a trust . It was to be so exercised for the benefit of subject people that they would eventually attain their birthright—freedom " . As a consequence of this opinion , Burke objected to the opium trade , which he called a " smuggling adventure " and condemned " the great Disgrace of the British character in India " .
Western Catalan comprises the two dialects of Northwestern Catalan and Valencian ; the Eastern block comprises four dialects : Central Catalan , Balearic , Rossellonese , and Alguerese . Each dialect can be further subdivided in several subdialects .
Prime Minister Josip Broz Tito met with the president of the Bishops ' Conference of Yugoslavia , Aloysius Stepinac on 4 June 1945 , two days after his release from imprisonment . The two could not reach an agreement on the state of the Catholic Church . Under Stepinac 's leadership , the bishops ' conference released a letter condemning alleged Partisan war crimes in September , 1945 . The following year Stepinac was arrested and put on trial . In October 1946 , in its first special session for 75 years , the Vatican excommunicated Tito and the Yugoslav government for sentencing Stepinac to 16 years in prison on charges of assisting Ustaše terror and of supporting forced conversions of Serbs to Catholicism . Stepinac received preferential treatment in recognition of his status and the sentence was soon shortened and reduced to house-arrest , with the option of emigration open to the archbishop . At the conclusion of the " Informbiro period " , reforms rendered Yugoslavia considerably more religiously liberal than the Eastern Bloc states .
Another body established under the Good Friday Agreement , the British–Irish Council , is made up of all of the states and territories of the British Isles . The British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly ( Irish : Tionól Pharlaiminteach na Breataine agus na hÉireann ) predates the British–Irish Council and was established in 1990 . Originally it comprised 25 members of the Oireachtas , the Irish parliament , and 25 members of the parliament of the United Kingdom , with the purpose of building mutual understanding between members of both legislatures . Since then the role and scope of the body has been expanded to include representatives from the Scottish Parliament , the National Assembly for Wales , the Northern Ireland Assembly , the States of Jersey , the States of Guernsey and the High Court of Tynwald ( Isle of Man ) .
Tiberius ' brother Gaius was elected tribune in 123 BC . Gaius Gracchus ' ultimate goal was to weaken the senate and to strengthen the democratic forces . In the past , for example , the senate would eliminate political rivals either by establishing special judicial commissions or by passing a senatus consultum ultimum ( " ultimate decree of the senate " ) . Both devices would allow the Senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights that all citizens had . Gaius outlawed the judicial commissions , and declared the senatus consultum ultimum to be unconstitutional . Gaius then proposed a law which would grant citizenship rights to Rome 's Italian allies . This last proposal was not popular with the plebeians and he lost much of his support . He stood for election to a third term in 121 BC , but was defeated and then murdered by representatives of the senate with 3,000 of his supporters on Capitoline Hill in Rome . Though the senate retained control , the Gracchi had strengthened the political influence of the plebeians .
The central government estimates that over 7,000 inadequately engineered schoolrooms collapsed in the earthquake . Chinese citizens have since invented a catch phrase : " tofu-dregs schoolhouses " ( Chinese : 豆腐渣校舍 ) , to mock both the quality and the quantity of these inferior constructions that killed so many school children . Due to the one-child policy , many families lost their only child when schools in the region collapsed during the earthquake . Consequently , Sichuan provincial and local officials have lifted the restriction for families whose only child was either killed or severely injured in the disaster . So-called " illegal children " under 18 years of age may be registered as legal replacements for their dead siblings ; if the dead child was illegal , no further outstanding fines would apply . Reimbursement would not , however , be offered for fines that were already levied .
The Romans had a greater appreciation for the color green ; it was the color of Venus , the goddess of gardens , vegetables and vineyards.The Romans made a fine green earth pigment , which was widely used in the wall paintings of Pompeii , Herculaneum , Lyon , Vaison-la-Romaine , and other Roman cities . They also used the pigment verdigris , made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine . By the Second Century AD , the Romans were using green in paintings , mosaics and glass , and there were ten different words in Latin for varieties of green .
The architecture of different parts of Asia developed along different lines from that of Europe ; Buddhist , Hindu and Sikh architecture each having different characteristics . Buddhist architecture , in particular , showed great regional diversity . Hindu temple architecture , which developed around the 3rd century BCE , is governed by concepts laid down in the Shastras , and is concerned with expressing the macrocosm and the microcosm . In many Asian countries , pantheistic religion led to architectural forms that were designed specifically to enhance the natural landscape .
Education remained mostly focused on the training of future clergy . The basic learning of the letters and numbers remained the province of the family or a village priest , but the secondary subjects of the trivium—grammar , rhetoric , logic—were studied in cathedral schools or in schools provided by cities . Commercial secondary schools spread , and some Italian towns had more than one such enterprise . Universities also spread throughout Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries . Lay literacy rates rose , but were still low ; one estimate gave a literacy rate of ten per cent of males and one per cent of females in 1500 .
The province 's name derives from the Zhe River ( 浙江 , Zhè Jiāng ) , the former name of the Qiantang River which flows past Hangzhou and whose mouth forms Hangzhou Bay . It is usually glossed as meaning " Crooked " or " Bent River " , from the meaning of Chinese 折 , but is more likely a phono-semantic compound formed from adding 氵 ( the " water " radical used for river names ) to phonetic 折 ( pinyin zhé but reconstructed Old Chinese *tet ) , preserving a proto-Wu name of the local Yue , similar to Yuhang , Kuaiji , and Jiang .

The novel is cited as a factor in the success of the civil rights movement in the 1960s , however , in that it " arrived at the right moment to help the South and the nation grapple with the racial tensions ( of ) the accelerating civil rights movement " . Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement , despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them . Civil Rights leader Andrew Young comments that part of the book 's effectiveness is that it " inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion " and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set . Young views the novel as " an act of humanity " in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices . Alabama author Mark Childress compares it to the impact of Uncle Tom 's Cabin , a book that is popularly implicated in starting the U.S. Civil War . Childress states the novel " gives white Southerners a way to understand the racism that they 've been brought up with and to find another way . And most white people in the South were good people . Most white people in the South were not throwing bombs and causing havoc ... I think the book really helped them come to understand what was wrong with the system in the way that any number of treatises could never do , because it was popular art , because it was told from a child 's point of view . "
The government planned to voluntarily evacuate four million people—mostly women and children—from urban areas , including 1.4 million from London . It expected about 90 % of evacuees to stay in private homes , and conducted an extensive survey to determine available space . Detailed preparations for transporting them were developed . A trial blackout was held on 10 August 1939 , and when Germany invaded Poland on 1 September a blackout began at sunset . Lights would not be allowed after dark for almost six years , and the blackout became by far the most unpopular aspect of the war for civilians , more than rationing . :51,106 The relocation of the government and the civil service was also planned , but would only have occurred if necessary so as not to damage civilian morale . :33
Jews also spread across Europe during the period . Communities were established in Germany and England in the 11th and 12th centuries , but Spanish Jews , long settled in Spain under the Muslims , came under Christian rule and increasing pressure to convert to Christianity . Most Jews were confined to the cities , as they were not allowed to own land or be peasants . [ U ] Besides the Jews , there were other non-Christians on the edges of Europe—pagan Slavs in Eastern Europe and Muslims in Southern Europe .
New Haven has been depicted in a number of movies . Scenes in the film All About Eve ( 1950 ) are set at the Taft Hotel ( now Taft Apartments ) on the corner of College and Chapel streets , and the history of New Haven theaters as Broadway " tryouts " is depicted in the Fred Astaire film The Band Wagon ( 1953 ) . The city was fictionally portrayed in the Steven Spielberg movie Amistad ( 1997 ) concerning the events around the mutiny trial of that ship 's rebelling captives . New Haven was also fictionalized in the movie The Skulls ( 2000 ) , which focused on conspiracy theories surrounding the real-life Skull and Bones secret society which is located in New Haven .
In The Use of Knowledge in Society ( 1945 ) , Hayek argued that the price mechanism serves to share and synchronise local and personal knowledge , allowing society 's members to achieve diverse , complicated ends through a principle of spontaneous self-organization . He contrasted the use of the price mechanism with central planning , arguing that the former allows for more rapid adaptation to changes in particular circumstances of time and place . Thus , he set the stage for Oliver Williamson 's later contrast between markets and hierarchies as alternative co-ordination mechanisms for economic transactions . He used the term catallaxy to describe a " self-organizing system of voluntary co-operation " . Hayek 's research into this argument was specifically cited by the Nobel Committee in its press release awarding Hayek the Nobel prize .
The Americo-Liberian settlers did not identify with the indigenous peoples they encountered , especially those in communities of the more isolated " bush . " They knew nothing of their cultures , languages or animist religion . Encounters with tribal Africans in the bush often developed as violent confrontations . The colonial settlements were raided by the Kru and Grebo people from their inland chiefdoms . Because of feeling set apart and superior by their culture and education to the indigenous peoples , the Americo-Liberians developed as a small elite that held on to political power . It excluded the indigenous tribesmen from birthright citizenship in their own lands until 1904 , in a repetition of the United States ' treatment of Native Americans . Because of the cultural gap between the groups and assumption of superiority of western culture , the Americo-Liberians envisioned creating a western-style state to which the tribesmen should assimilate . They encouraged religious organizations to set up missions and schools to educate the indigenous peoples .
Dietary deficiencies in developing countries can be combated by promoting better eating practices . Supplementation with vitamin A and/or zinc . Zinc supplementation proved successful showing a significant decrease in the incidence of diarrheal disease compared to a control group . The majority of the literature suggests that vitamin A supplementation is advantageous in reducing disease incidence . Development of a supplementation strategy should take into consideration the fact that vitamin A supplementation was less effective in reducing diarrhea incidence when compared to vitamin A and zinc supplementation , and that the latter strategy was estimated to be significantly more cost effective .
Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs , but was unable to do so as only one son , Louis the Pious ( r. 814–840 ) , was still alive by 813 . Just before Charlemagne died in 814 , he crowned Louis as his successor . Louis 's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and , after 829 , civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire . Eventually , Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I ( d. 855 ) as emperor and gave him Italy . Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald ( d. 877 ) , his youngest son . Lothair took East Francia , comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards , leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps . Louis the German ( d. 876 ) , the middle child , who had been rebellious to the last , was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother . The division was disputed . Pepin II of Aquitaine ( d. after 864 ) , the emperor 's grandson , rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine , while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia . Louis the Pious died in 840 , with the empire still in chaos .
People of Ashkenazi descent constitute around 47.5 % of Israeli Jews ( and therefore 35–36 % of Israelis ) . They have played a prominent role in the economy , media , and politics of Israel since its founding . During the first decades of Israel as a state , strong cultural conflict occurred between Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews ( mainly east European Ashkenazim ) . The roots of this conflict , which still exists to a much smaller extent in present-day Israeli society , are chiefly attributed to the concept of the " melting pot " . That is to say , all Jewish immigrants who arrived in Israel were strongly encouraged to " melt down " their own particular exilic identities within the general social " pot " in order to become Israeli .
All armies soon deployed AA guns often based on their smaller field pieces , notably the French 75 mm and Russian 76.2 mm , typically simply propped up on some sort of embankment to get the muzzle pointed skyward . The British Army adopted the 13-pounder quickly producing new mountings suitable for AA use , the 13-pdr QF 6 cwt Mk III was issued in 1915 . It remained in service throughout the war but 18-pdr guns were lined down to take the 13-pdr shell with a larger cartridge producing the 13-pr QF 9 cwt and these proved much more satisfactory . However , in general , these ad-hoc solutions proved largely useless . With little experience in the role , no means of measuring target , range , height or speed the difficulty of observing their shell bursts relative to the target gunners proved unable to get their fuse setting correct and most rounds burst well below their targets . The exception to this rule was the guns protecting spotting balloons , in which case the altitude could be accurately measured from the length of the cable holding the balloon .
Investitures , which include the conferring of knighthoods by dubbing with a sword , and other awards take place in the palace 's Ballroom , built in 1854 . At 36.6 m ( 120 ft ) long , 18 m ( 59 ft ) wide and 13.5 m ( 44 ft ) high , it is the largest room in the palace . It has replaced the throne room in importance and use . During investitures , the Queen stands on the throne dais beneath a giant , domed velvet canopy , known as a shamiana or a baldachin , that was used at the Delhi Durbar in 1911 . A military band plays in the musicians ' gallery as award recipients approach the Queen and receive their honours , watched by their families and friends .
During the year following that contract , with Dodsley , Burke founded the influential Annual Register , a publication in which various authors evaluated the international political events of the previous year . The extent to which Burke contributed to the Annual Register is unclear : in his biography of Burke , Robert Murray quotes the Register as evidence of Burke 's opinions , yet Philip Magnus in his biography does not cite it directly as a reference . Burke remained the chief editor of the publication until at least 1789 and there is no evidence that any other writer contributed to it before 1766 .
Despite being a persistent critic of some of the government 's policies , the paper supported Labour in both subsequent elections the party won . For the 2005 general election , The Sun backed Blair and Labour for a third consecutive election win and vowed to give him " one last chance " to fulfil his promises , despite berating him for several weaknesses including a failure to control immigration . However , it did speak of its hope that the Conservatives ( led by Michael Howard ) would one day be fit for a return to government . This election ( Blair had declared it would be his last as prime minister ) resulted in Labour 's third successive win but with a much reduced majority .
England 's first permanent settlement in the Americas was founded in 1607 in Jamestown , led by Captain John Smith and managed by the Virginia Company . Bermuda was settled and claimed by England as a result of the 1609 shipwreck there of the Virginia Company 's flagship , and in 1615 was turned over to the newly formed Somers Isles Company . The Virginia Company 's charter was revoked in 1624 and direct control of Virginia was assumed by the crown , thereby founding the Colony of Virginia . The London and Bristol Company was created in 1610 with the aim of creating a permanent settlement on Newfoundland , but was largely unsuccessful . In 1620 , Plymouth was founded as a haven for puritan religious separatists , later known as the Pilgrims . Fleeing from religious persecution would become the motive of many English would-be colonists to risk the arduous trans-Atlantic voyage : Maryland was founded as a haven for Roman Catholics ( 1634 ) , Rhode Island ( 1636 ) as a colony tolerant of all religions and Connecticut ( 1639 ) for Congregationalists . The Province of Carolina was founded in 1663 . With the surrender of Fort Amsterdam in 1664 , England gained control of the Dutch colony of New Netherland , renaming it New York . This was formalised in negotiations following the Second Anglo-Dutch War , in exchange for Suriname . In 1681 , the colony of Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn . The American colonies were less financially successful than those of the Caribbean , but had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants who preferred their temperate climates .
The National Incident Based Reporting System ( NIBRS ) crime statistics system aims to address limitations inherent in UCR data . The system is used by law enforcement agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes . Local , state , and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their records management systems . Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense category . The Group A offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories . Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system . In addition to the Group A offenses , eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information . The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary-based UCR system . As of 2004 , 5,271 law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data . That amount represents 20 % of the United States population and 16 % of the crime statistics data collected by the FBI .
In season eight , Latin Grammy Award-nominated singer–songwriter and record producer Kara DioGuardi was added as a fourth judge . She stayed for two seasons and left the show before season ten . Paula Abdul left the show before season nine after failing to agree terms with the show producers . Emmy Award-winning talk show host Ellen DeGeneres replaced Paula Abdul for that season , but left after just one season . On January 11 , 2010 , Simon Cowell announced that he was leaving the show to pursue introducing the American version of his show The X Factor to the USA for 2011 . Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined the judging panel in season ten , but both left after two seasons . They were replaced by three new judges , Mariah Carey , Nicki Minaj and Keith Urban , who joined Randy Jackson in season 12 . However both Carey and Minaj left after one season , and Randy Jackson also announced that he would depart the show after twelve seasons as a judge but would return as a mentor . Urban is the only judge from season 12 to return in season 13 . He was joined by previous judge Jennifer Lopez and former mentor Harry Connick , Jr.. Lopez , Urban and Connick , Jr. all returned as judges for the show 's fourteenth and fifteenth seasons .
Reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication . Literary analysis of it is sparse , considering the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education . Author Mary McDonough Murphy , who collected individual impressions of To Kill a Mockingbird by several authors and public figures , calls the book , " an astonishing phenomenon " . In 2006 , British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one " every adult should read before they die " . It was adapted into an Oscar-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan , with a screenplay by Horton Foote . Since 1990 , a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee 's hometown of Monroeville , Alabama .
The foundation trust invests undistributed assets , with the exclusive goal of maximizing the return on investment . As a result , its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries where the foundation is attempting to relieve poverty . These include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world . In response to press criticism , the foundation announced in 2007 a review of its investments to assess social responsibility . It subsequently cancelled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return , while using voting rights to influence company practices .
The " snug " , sometimes called the smoke room , was typically a small , very private room with access to the bar that had a frosted glass external window , set above head height . A higher price was paid for beer in the snug and nobody could look in and see the drinkers . It was not only the wealthy visitors who would use these rooms . The snug was for patrons who preferred not to be seen in the public bar . Ladies would often enjoy a private drink in the snug in a time when it was frowned upon for women to be in a pub . The local police officer might nip in for a quiet pint , the parish priest for his evening whisky , or lovers for a rendezvous .
The city uses the strong-mayor version of the mayor-council form of government , which is headed by one mayor , in whom executive authority is vested . Elected at-large , the mayor is limited to two consecutive four-year terms under the city 's home rule charter , but can run for the position again after an intervening term . The Mayor is Jim Kenney , who replaced Michael Nutter , who served two terms from 2009 to January 2016 . Kenney , as all Philadelphia mayors have been since 1952 , is a member of the Democratic Party , which tends to dominate local politics so thoroughly that the Democratic Mayoral primary is often more widely covered than the general election . The legislative branch , the Philadelphia City Council , consists of ten council members representing individual districts and seven members elected at large . Democrats currently hold 14 seats , with Republicans representing two allotted at-large seats for the minority party , as well as the Northeast-based Tenth District . The current council president is Darrell Clarke .
This new approach liberated scientific speculation from the dogmatic restraints of Aristotelian science , and paved the way for new approaches . Particularly within the field of theories of motion great advances were made , when such scholars as Jean Buridan , Nicole Oresme and the Oxford Calculators challenged the work of Aristotle . Buridan developed the theory of impetus as the cause of the motion of projectiles , which was an important step towards the modern concept of inertia . The works of these scholars anticipated the heliocentric worldview of Nicolaus Copernicus .
Martin Luther , who initiated the Protestant Reformation , said : " Mother Mary , like us , was born in sin of sinful parents , but the Holy Spirit covered her , sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood , but not with sinful flesh and blood . The Holy Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true , natural human being of flesh and blood , just as we . However , he warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became the mother of a pure child , not poisoned by sin as we are . For in that moment when she conceived , she was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy pure fruit , at once God and truly man , in one person . " Some Lutherans , such as the members of the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church , support the doctrine .
A wrestler may voluntarily submit by verbally informing the referee ( usually used in moves such as the Mexican Surfboard , where all four limbs are incapacitated , making tapping impossible ) . Also , since Ken Shamrock ( a legitimate UFC competitor in its early days ) popularized it in 1997 , a wrestler can indicate a voluntary submission by " tapping out " , that is , tapping a free hand against the mat or against an opponent . Occasionally , a wrestler will reach for a rope ( see rope breaks below ) , only to put their hand back on the mat so they can crawl towards the rope some more ; this is not a submission , and the referee decides what their intent is .
and Camargo . In 1631 Juan Rangel de Biezma discovered a rich vein of silver , and subsequently established San Jose del Parral near the site . Parral remained an important economic and cultural center for the next 300 years . On December 8 , 1659 Fray García de San Francisco founded the mission of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Mansos del Paso del Río del Norte and founded the town El Paso Del Norte ( present day Ciudad Juárez ) in 1667 . The Spanish society that developed in the region replaced the sparse population of indigenous peoples . The absence of servants and workers forged the spirit of northern people as self-dependent , creative people that defended their European heritage . In 1680 settlers from Santa Fe , New Mexico sought refuge in El Paso Del Norte for twelve years after fleeing the attacks from Pueblo tribes , but returned to Santa Fe in 1692 after Diego de Vargas recaptured the city and vicinity . In 1709 , Antonio de Deza y Ulloa founded the state capital Chihuahua City ; shortly after , the city became the headquarters for the regional mining offices of the Spanish crown known as Real de Minas de San Francisco de Cuéllar in honor of the Viceroy of New Spain , Francisco Fernández de la Cueva Enríquez , Duke of Alburquerque and the Marquee of Cuéllar..
As of 2008 [ update ] , the population was 47.5 % male and 52.5 % female . The population was made up of 44,032 Swiss men ( 35.4 % of the population ) and 15,092 ( 12.1 % ) non-Swiss men . There were 51,531 Swiss women ( 41.4 % ) and 13,726 ( 11.0 % ) non-Swiss women . Of the population in the municipality , 39,008 or about 30.3 % were born in Bern and lived there in 2000 . There were 27,573 or 21.4 % who were born in the same canton , while 25,818 or 20.1 % were born somewhere else in Switzerland , and 27,812 or 21.6 % were born outside of Switzerland .
With French , Belgian and Portuguese activity in the lower Congo River region undermining orderly incursion of tropical Africa , the Berlin Conference of 1884–85 was held to regulate the competition between the European powers in what was called the " Scramble for Africa " by defining " effective occupation " as the criterion for international recognition of territorial claims . The scramble continued into the 1890s , and caused Britain to reconsider its decision in 1885 to withdraw from Sudan . A joint force of British and Egyptian troops defeated the Mahdist Army in 1896 , and rebuffed a French attempted invasion at Fashoda in 1898 . Sudan was nominally made an Anglo-Egyptian Condominium , but a British colony in reality .
According to one of her biographers , Giles St Aubyn , Victoria wrote an average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life . From July 1832 until just before her death , she kept a detailed journal , which eventually encompassed 122 volumes . After Victoria 's death , her youngest daughter , Princess Beatrice , was appointed her literary executor . Beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria 's accession onwards , and burned the originals in the process . Despite this destruction , much of the diaries still exist . In addition to Beatrice 's edited copy , Lord Esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them . Part of Victoria 's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by A. C. Benson , Hector Bolitho , George Earle Buckle , Lord Esher , Roger Fulford , and Richard Hough among others .
Modern-day Nigeria has been the site of numerous kingdoms and tribal states over the millennia . The modern state originated from British colonial rule beginning in the 19th century , and the merging of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate in 1914 . The British set up administrative and legal structures whilst practising indirect rule through traditional chiefdoms . Nigeria became a formally independent federation in 1960 , and plunged into a civil war from 1967 to 1970 . It has since alternated between democratically-elected civilian governments and military dictatorships , until it achieved a stable democracy in 1999 , with its 2011 presidential elections being viewed as the first to be conducted reasonably freely and fairly .
Slavic studies began as an almost exclusively linguistic and philological enterprise . As early as 1833 , Slavic languages were recognized as Indo-European .
Napoleon 's educational reforms laid the foundation of a modern system of education in France and throughout much of Europe . Napoleon synthesized the best academic elements from the Ancien Régime , The Enlightenment , and the Revolution , with the aim of establishing a stable , well-educated and prosperous society . He made French the only official language . He left some primary education in the hands of religious orders , but he offered public support to secondary education . Napoleon founded a number of state secondary schools ( lycées ) designed to produce a standardized education that was uniform across France . All students were taught the sciences along with modern and classical languages . Unlike the system during the Ancien Régime , religious topics did not dominate the curriculum , although they were present in addition to teachers from the clergy . Napoleon simply hoped to use religion to produce social stability . He gave special attention to the advanced centers , notably the École Polytechnique , that provided both military expertise and state-of-the-art research in science . Napoleon made some of the first major efforts at establishing a system of secular and public education . The system featured scholarships and strict discipline , with the result being a French educational system that outperformed its European counterparts , many of which borrowed from the French system .
Most elevators have a location in which the permit for the building owner to operate the elevator is displayed . While some jurisdictions require the permit to be displayed in the elevator cab , other jurisdictions allow for the operating permit to be kept on file elsewhere – such as the maintenance office – and to be made available for inspection on demand . In such cases instead of the permit being displayed in the elevator cab , often a notice is posted in its place informing riders of where the actual permits are kept .
According to the latest International Monetary Fund estimates , its per capita GDP ( adjusted for purchasing power ) at $ 30,769 is just above the average of the European Union . [ citation needed ] Cyprus has been sought as a base for several offshore businesses for its low tax rates . Tourism , financial services and shipping are significant parts of the economy . Economic policy of the Cyprus government has focused on meeting the criteria for admission to the European Union . The Cypriot government adopted the euro as the national currency on 1 January 2008 .
Gaddafi married his first wife , Fatiha al-Nuri , in 1969 . She was the daughter of General Khalid , a senior figure in King Idris ' administration , and was from a middle-class background . Although they had one son , Muhammad Gaddafi ( b . 1970 ) , their relationship was strained , and they divorced in 1970 . Gaddafi 's second wife was Safia Farkash , née el-Brasai , a former nurse from Obeidat tribe born in Bayda . They met in 1969 , following his ascension to power , when he was hospitalized with appendicitis ; he claimed that it was love at first sight . The couple remained married until his death . Together they had seven biological children : Saif al-Islam Gaddafi ( b . 1972 ) , Al-Saadi Gaddafi ( b . 1973 ) , Mutassim Gaddafi ( 1974–2011 ) , Hannibal Muammar Gaddafi ( b . 1975 ) , Ayesha Gaddafi ( b . 1976 ) , Saif al-Arab Gaddafi ( 1982–2011 ) , and Khamis Gaddafi ( 1983–2011 ) . He also adopted two children , Hanna Gaddafi and Milad Gaddafi .
Greater London 's population declined steadily in the decades after the Second World War , from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s . The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury , with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration , including the Canary Wharf development . This was borne out of London 's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s . The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea .
Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area . Linguistic and DNA studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge . [ citation needed ] The Tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska , along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon . Also in Southeast were the Haida , now well known for their unique arts . The Tsimshian people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887 , when President Grover Cleveland , and later the U.S. Congress , granted them permission to settle on Annette Island and found the town of Metlakatla . All three of these peoples , as well as other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast , experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century , with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s , resulting in high fatalities and social disruption .
From the 1880s to 1914 , the European powers expanded their control across the African continent , competing with each other for Africa’s land and resources . Great Britain controlled various colonial holdings in East Africa that spanned the length of the African continent from Egypt in the north to South Africa . The French gained major ground in West Africa , and the Portuguese held colonies in southern Africa . Germany , Italy , and Spain established a small number of colonies at various points throughout the continent , which included German East Africa ( Tanganyika ) and German Southwest Africa for Germany , Eritrea and Libya for Italy , and the Canary Islands and Rio de Oro in northwestern Africa for Spain . Finally , for King Leopold ( ruled from 1865–1909 ) , there was the large “piece of that great African cake” known as the Congo , which , unfortunately for the native Congolese , became his personal fiefdom to do with as he pleased in Central Africa . By 1914 , almost the entire continent was under European control . Liberia , which was settled by freed American slaves in the 1820s , and Abyssinia ( Ethiopia ) in eastern Africa were the last remaining independent African states .

On 6 August 1940 , Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union as the Estonian SSR . The provisions in the Estonian constitution requiring a popular referendum to decide on joining a supra-national body were ignored . Instead the vote to join the Soviet Union was taken by those elected in the elections held the previous month . Additionally those who had failed to do their " political duty " of voting Estonia into the USSR , specifically those who had failed to have their passports stamped for voting , were condemned to death by Soviet tribunals . The repressions followed with the mass deportations carried out by the Soviets in Estonia on 14 June 1941 . Many of the country 's political and intellectual leaders were killed or deported to remote areas of the USSR by the Soviet authorities in 1940–1941 . Repressive actions were also taken against thousands of ordinary people .
People of all ages and social statuses were depicted in the art of the Hellenistic age . Artists such as Peiraikos chose mundane and lower class subjects for his paintings . According to Pliny , " He painted barbers ' shops , cobblers ' stalls , asses , eatables and similar subjects , earning for himself the name of rhyparographos [ painter of dirt/low things ] . In these subjects he could give consummate pleasure , selling them for more than other artists received for their large pictures " ( Natural History , Book XXXV.112 ) . Even barbarians , such as the Galatians , were depicted in heroic form , prefiguring the artistic theme of the noble savage . The image of Alexander the Great was also an important artistic theme , and all of the diadochi had themselves depicted imitating Alexander 's youthful look . A number of the best-known works of Greek sculpture belong to the Hellenistic period , including Laocoön and his Sons , Venus de Milo , and the Winged Victory of Samothrace .
During the late 1980s and early 1990s , Richmond experienced a spike in overall crime , in particular , the city 's murder rate . The city had 93 murders for the year of 1985 , with a murder rate of 41.9 killings committed per 100,000 residents . Over the next decade , the city saw a major increase in total homicides . In 1990 there were 114 murders , for a murder rate of 56.1 killings per 100,000 residents . There were 120 murders in 1995 , resulting in a murder rate of 59.1 killings per 100,000 residents , one of the highest in the United States .
On 14 September 2009 , U.S. Special Forces killed two men and wounded and captured two others near the Somali village of Baarawe . Witnesses claim that helicopters used for the operation launched from French-flagged warships , but that could not be confirmed . A Somali-based al-Qaida affiliated group , the Al-Shabaab , has confirmed the death of " sheik commander " Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan along with an unspecified number of militants . Nabhan , a Kenyan , was wanted in connection with the 2002 Mombasa attacks .
On January 8 , 2004 , Hewlett-Packard ( HP ) announced that they would sell HP-branded iPods under a license agreement from Apple . Several new retail channels were used—including Wal-Mart—and these iPods eventually made up 5 % of all iPod sales . In July 2005 , HP stopped selling iPods due to unfavorable terms and conditions imposed by Apple .
East of the divide , several roughly parallel ranges cover the southern part of the state , including the Gravelly Range , the Madison Range , Gallatin Range , Absaroka Mountains and the Beartooth Mountains . The Beartooth Plateau is the largest continuous land mass over 10,000 feet ( 3,000 m ) high in the continental United States . It contains the highest point in the state , Granite Peak , 12,799 feet ( 3,901 m ) high . North of these ranges are the Big Belt Mountains , Bridger Mountains , Tobacco Roots , and several island ranges , including the Crazy Mountains and Little Belt Mountains .
The Seljuk Empire soon started to collapse . In the early 12th century , Armenian princes of the Zakarid noble family drove out the Seljuk Turks and established a semi-independent Armenian principality in Northern and Eastern Armenia , known as Zakarid Armenia , which lasted under the patronage of the Georgian Kingdom . The noble family of Orbelians shared control with the Zakarids in various parts of the country , especially in Syunik and Vayots Dzor , while the Armenian family of Hasan-Jalalians controlled provinces of Artsakh and Utik as the Kingdom of Artsakh .
Ann Arbor has a long history of openness to marijuana , given Ann Arbor 's decriminalization of cannabis , the large number of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city ( one dispensary , called People 's Co-op , was directly across the street from Michigan Stadium until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west ) , the large number of pro-marijuana residents , and the annual Hash Bash : an event that is held on the first Saturday of April . Until ( at least ) the successful passage of Michigan 's medical marijuana law , the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent , although for years , a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property , which does not fall under the City 's progressive and compassionate ticketing program .
As a young child , Bell , like his brothers , received his early schooling at home from his father . At an early age , however , he was enrolled at the Royal High School , Edinburgh , Scotland , which he left at age 15 , completing only the first four forms . His school record was undistinguished , marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades . His main interest remained in the sciences , especially biology , while he treated other school subjects with indifference , to the dismay of his demanding father . Upon leaving school , Bell travelled to London to live with his grandfather , Alexander Bell . During the year he spent with his grandfather , a love of learning was born , with long hours spent in serious discussion and study . The elder Bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction , the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself . At age 16 , Bell secured a position as a " pupil-teacher " of elocution and music , in Weston House Academy , at Elgin , Moray , Scotland . Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek , he instructed classes himself in return for board and £10 per session . The following year , he attended the University of Edinburgh ; joining his older brother Melville who had enrolled there the previous year . In 1868 , not long before he departed for Canada with his family , Bell completed his matriculation exams and was accepted for admission to the University of London .
Muhammad also ordered another siege on the Banu Qurayza during the Invasion of Banu Qurayza , because according to Muslim tradition he had been ordered to do so by the angel Gabriel . Al-Waqidi claims Muhammad had a treaty with the tribe which was torn apart . Stillman and Watt deny the authenticity of al-Waqidi . Al-Waqidi has been frequently criticized by Muslim writers , who claim that he is unreliable . 600-900 members of the Banu Qurayza were beheaded after they surrendered ( according to Tabari and Ibn Hisham ) . Another source says all Males and 1 woman beheaded ( according to Sunni Hadith ) . Two Muslims were killed
One facet of the changing attitude toward Korea and whether to get involved was Japan . Especially after the fall of China to the Communists , U.S. East Asian experts saw Japan as the critical counterweight to the Soviet Union and China in the region . While there was no United States policy that dealt with South Korea directly as a national interest , its proximity to Japan increased the importance of South Korea . Said Kim : " The recognition that the security of Japan required a non-hostile Korea led directly to President Truman 's decision to intervene ... The essential point ... is that the American response to the North Korean attack stemmed from considerations of US policy toward Japan . "
In his early years Popper was impressed by Marxism , whether of Communists or socialists . An event that happened in 1919 had a profound effect on him : During a riot , caused by the Communists , the police shot several unarmed people , including some of Popper 's friends , when they tried to free party comrades from prison . The riot had , in fact , been part of a plan by which leaders of the Communist party with connections to Béla Kun tried to take power by a coup ; Popper did not know about this at that time . However , he knew that the riot instigators were swayed by the Marxist doctrine that class struggle would produce vastly more dead men than the inevitable revolution brought about as quickly as possible , and so had no scruples to put the life of the rioters at risk to achieve their selfish goal of becoming the future leaders of the working class . This was the start of his later criticism of historicism . Popper began to reject Marxist historicism , which he associated with questionable means , and later socialism , which he associated with placing equality before freedom ( to the possible disadvantage of equality ) .
The operational framework is provided by the Byelaws , which are more frequently updated than the Charter . Any revisions to the Charter or Byelaws require the Privy Council 's approval .
Thermal conductivity gauges rely on the fact that the ability of a gas to conduct heat decreases with pressure . In this type of gauge , a wire filament is heated by running current through it . A thermocouple or Resistance Temperature Detector ( RTD ) can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament . This temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas , and therefore on the thermal conductivity . A common variant is the Pirani gauge which uses a single platinum filament as both the heated element and RTD . These gauges are accurate from 10 torr to 10−3 torr , but they are sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured .
Following the hardliners ' takeover , the September 30 , 1990 elections ( runoffs on October 14 ) were characterized by intimidation ; several Popular Front candidates were jailed , two were murdered , and unabashed ballot stuffing took place even in the presence of Western observers . The election results reflected the threatening environment ; out of the 350 members , 280 were Communists , with only 45 opposition candidates from the Popular Front and other non-communist groups , who together formed a Democratic Bloc ( " Dembloc " ) . In May 1990 Mutalibov was elected Chairman of the Supreme Soviet unopposed .
The Xeer legal system is assumed to have developed exclusively in the Horn of Africa since approximately the 7th century . There is no evidence that it developed elsewhere or was greatly influenced by any foreign legal system . The fact that Somali legal terminology is practically devoid of loan words from foreign languages suggests that Xeer is truly indigenous .
Eritrea is a multilingual country . The nation has no official language , as the Constitution establishes the " equality of all Eritrean languages " . However , Tigrinya serves as the de facto language of national identity . With 2,540,000 total speakers of a population of 5,254,000 in 2006 , Tigrinya is the most widely spoken language , particularly in the southern and central parts of Eritrea . Modern Standard Arabic and English serve as de facto working languages , with the latter used in university education and many technical fields . Italian , the former colonial language , is widely used in commerce and is taught as a second language in schools , with a few elderly monolinguals .
The earliest known American lodges were in Pennsylvania . The Collector for the port of Pennsylvania , John Moore , wrote of attending lodges there in 1715 , two years before the formation of the first Grand Lodge in London . The Premier Grand Lodge of England appointed a Provincial Grand Master for North America in 1731 , based in Pennsylvania . Other lodges in the colony obtained authorisations from the later Antient Grand Lodge of England , the Grand Lodge of Scotland , and the Grand Lodge of Ireland , which was particularly well represented in the travelling lodges of the British Army . Many lodges came into existence with no warrant from any Grand Lodge , applying and paying for their authorisation only after they were confident of their own survival .
In September 2013 , West was widely rebuked by human rights groups for performing in Kazakhstan at the wedding of authoritarian President Nursultan Nazarbayev 's grandson . He traveled to Kazakhstan , which has one of the poorest human rights records in the world , as a personal guest of Nazarbayev . Other notable Western performers , including Sting , have previously cancelled performances in the country over human rights concerns . West was reportedly paid US $ 3 million for his performance . West had previously participated in cultural boycotts , joining Shakira and Rage Against The Machine in refusing to perform in Arizona after the 2010 implementation of stop and search laws directed against potential illegal aliens .
In Islam , dogs are viewed as unclean because they are viewed as scavengers . In 2015 city councillor Hasan Küçük of The Hague called for dog ownership to be made illegal in that city . Islamic activists in Lérida , Spain , lobbied for dogs to be kept out of Muslim neighborhoods , saying their presence violated Muslims ' religious freedom . In Britain , police sniffer dogs are carefully used , and are not permitted to contact passengers , only their luggage . They are required to wear leather dog booties when searching mosques or Muslim homes .
On October 1 , 2011 , Kanye West premiered his women 's fashion label , DW Kanye West at Paris Fashion Week . He received support from DSquared2 duo Dean and Dan Caten , Olivier Theyskens , Jeremy Scott , Azzedine Alaïa , and the Olsen twins , who were also in attendance during his show . His debut fashion show received mixed-to-negative reviews , ranging from reserved observations by Style.com to excoriating commentary by The Wall Street Journal , The New York Times , the International Herald Tribune , Elleuk.com , The Daily Telegraph , Harper 's Bazaar and many others . On March 6 , 2012 , West premiered a second fashion line at Paris Fashion Week . The line 's reception was markedly improved from the previous presentation , with a number of critics heralding West for his " much improved " sophomore effort .
A necessary condition for the aforementioned reciprocity property is that the materials in the antenna and transmission medium are linear and reciprocal . Reciprocal ( or bilateral ) means that the material has the same response to an electric current or magnetic field in one direction , as it has to the field or current in the opposite direction . Most materials used in antennas meet these conditions , but some microwave antennas use high-tech components such as isolators and circulators , made of nonreciprocal materials such as ferrite . These can be used to give the antenna a different behavior on receiving than it has on transmitting , which can be useful in applications like radar .
William Champion 's brother , John , patented a process in 1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process . Prior to this , only calamine could be used to produce zinc . In 1798 , Johann Christian Ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter . Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium , which processed even more zinc . Italian doctor Luigi Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog 's leg to twitch . He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect " animal electricity " . The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani and these discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries , galvanization and cathodic protection .
Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties . Uranium-235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissile isotope . Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons , and is fertile , meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor . Another fissile isotope , uranium-233 , can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology . While uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons , uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons . In sufficient concentration , these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction . This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors , and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons . Depleted uranium ( 238U ) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating .
Modern DST was first proposed by the New Zealand entomologist George Hudson , whose shift-work job gave him leisure time to collect insects , and led him to value after-hours daylight . In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift , and after considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch , he followed up in an 1898 paper . Many publications credit DST 's proposal to the prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett , who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre-breakfast ride , when he observed with dismay how many Londoners slept through a large part of a summer 's day . An avid golfer , he also disliked cutting short his round at dusk . His solution was to advance the clock during the summer months , a proposal he published two years later . The proposal was taken up by the Liberal Member of Parliament ( MP ) Robert Pearce , who introduced the first Daylight Saving Bill to the House of Commons on 12 February 1908 . A select committee was set up to examine the issue , but Pearce 's bill did not become law , and several other bills failed in the following years . Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915 .
Such strategies , which minimize the maximum loss for each player , are called optimal . Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal ( in absolute value ) and contrary ( in sign ) . Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players , publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior ( written with Oskar Morgenstern ) . Morgenstern wrote a paper on game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject . He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it . This was repeated a couple of times , and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long . Then it became a book . The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story . In this book , von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods , especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem , rather than the traditional differential calculus , because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions .
The relative pitches of individual notes in a scale may be determined by one of a number of tuning systems . In the west , the twelve-note chromatic scale is the most common method of organization , with equal temperament now the most widely used method of tuning that scale . In it , the pitch ratio between any two successive notes of the scale is exactly the twelfth root of two ( or about 1.05946 ) . In well-tempered systems ( as used in the time of Johann Sebastian Bach , for example ) , different methods of musical tuning were used . Almost all of these systems have one interval in common , the octave , where the pitch of one note is double the frequency of another . For example , if the A above middle C is 440 Hz , the A an octave above that is 880 Hz ( info ) .
Nouns are also inflected for number , distinguishing between singular and plural . Typical of a Slavic language , Czech cardinal numbers one through four allow the nouns and adjectives they modify to take any case , but numbers over five place these nouns and adjectives in the genitive case when the entire expression is in nominative or accusative case . The Czech koruna is an example of this feature ; it is shown here as the subject of a hypothetical sentence , and declined as genitive for numbers five and up .
For over a century , New Haven citizens had fought in the colonial militia alongside regular British forces , as in the French and Indian War . As the American Revolution approached , General David Wooster and other influential residents hoped that the conflict with the government in Britain could be resolved short of rebellion . On 23 April 1775 , which is still celebrated in New Haven as Powder House Day , the Second Company , Governor 's Foot Guard , of New Haven entered the struggle against the governing British parliament . Under Captain Benedict Arnold , they broke into the powder house to arm themselves and began a three-day march to Cambridge , Massachusetts . Other New Haven militia members were on hand to escort George Washington from his overnight stay in New Haven on his way to Cambridge . Contemporary reports , from both sides , remark on the New Haven volunteers ' professional military bearing , including uniforms .
Several commentators have suggested that if the liquidity crisis continues , an extended recession or worse could occur . The continuing development of the crisis has prompted fears of a global economic collapse although there are now many cautiously optimistic forecasters in addition to some prominent sources who remain negative . The financial crisis is likely to yield the biggest banking shakeout since the savings-and-loan meltdown . Investment bank UBS stated on October 6 that 2008 would see a clear global recession , with recovery unlikely for at least two years . Three days later UBS economists announced that the " beginning of the end " of the crisis had begun , with the world starting to make the necessary actions to fix the crisis : capital injection by governments ; injection made systemically ; interest rate cuts to help borrowers . The United Kingdom had started systemic injection , and the world 's central banks were now cutting interest rates . UBS emphasized the United States needed to implement systemic injection . UBS further emphasized that this fixes only the financial crisis , but that in economic terms " the worst is still to come " . UBS quantified their expected recession durations on October 16 : the Eurozone 's would last two quarters , the United States ' would last three quarters , and the United Kingdom 's would last four quarters . The economic crisis in Iceland involved all three of the country 's major banks . Relative to the size of its economy , Iceland’s banking collapse is the largest suffered by any country in economic history .
Captain John Charles Marshall and Thomas Gilbert visited the islands in 1788 . The islands were named for Marshall on Western charts , although the natives have historically named their home " jolet jen Anij " ( Gifts from God ) . Around 1820 , Russian explorer Adam Johann von Krusenstern and the French explorer Louis Isidore Duperrey named the islands after John Marshall , and drew maps of the islands . The designation was repeated later on British maps . [ citation needed ] In 1824 the crew of the American whaler Globe mutinied and some of the crew put ashore on Mulgrave Island . One year later , the American schooner Dolphin arrived and picked up two boys , the last survivors of a massacre by the natives due to their brutal treatment of the women . :2
A collector of film memorabilia , Spielberg purchased a balsa Rosebud sled from Citizen Kane ( 1941 ) in 1982 . He bought Orson Welles 's own directorial copy of the script for the radio broadcast The War of the Worlds ( 1938 ) in 1994 . Spielberg has purchased Academy Award statuettes being sold on the open market and donated them to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , to prevent their further commercial exploitation . His donations include the Oscars that Bette Davis received for Dangerous ( 1935 ) and Jezebel ( 1938 ) , and Clark Gable 's Oscar for It Happened One Night ( 1934 ) .
According to the latest nationwide census , Roman Catholics constituted 30.8 % of the total population of Germany , followed by the Evangelical Protestants at 30.3 % . Other religions , atheists or not specified constituted 38.8 % of the population at the time . Among " others " are Protestants not included in Evangelical Church of Germany , and other Christians such as the Restorationist New Apostolic Church . Protestantism was more common among the citizens of Germany . The North and East Germany is predominantly Protestant , the South and West rather Catholic . Nowadays there is a non-religious majority in Hamburg and the East German states .
In their attempt to ensure white supremacy decades after emancipation , in the early 20th century , most southern states created laws based on the one-drop rule , defining as black , persons with any known African ancestry . This was a stricter interpretation than what had prevailed in the 19th century ; it ignored the many mixed families in the state and went against commonly accepted social rules of judging a person by appearance and association . Some courts called it " the traceable amount rule . " Anthropologists called it an example of a hypodescent rule , meaning that racially mixed persons were assigned the status of the socially subordinate group .
During the Cambrian period , Gondwana had a mild climate . West Antarctica was partially in the Northern Hemisphere , and during this period large amounts of sandstones , limestones and shales were deposited . East Antarctica was at the equator , where sea floor invertebrates and trilobites flourished in the tropical seas . By the start of the Devonian period ( 416 Ma ) , Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler , though fossils of land plants are known from this time . Sand and silts were laid down in what is now the Ellsworth , Horlick and Pensacola Mountains . Glaciation began at the end of the Devonian period ( 360 Ma ) , as Gondwana became centered on the South Pole and the climate cooled , though flora remained . During the Permian period , the land became dominated by seed plants such as Glossopteris , a pteridosperm which grew in swamps . Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the Transantarctic Mountains . Towards the end of the Permian period , continued warming led to a dry , hot climate over much of Gondwana .
While the original Xbox sold poorly in Japan , selling just 2 million units while it was on the market ( between 2002 and 2005 ) , [ citation needed ] the Xbox 360 sold even more poorly , selling only 1.5 million units from 2005 to 2011 . Edge magazine reported in August 2011 that initially lackluster and subsequently falling sales in Japan , where Microsoft had been unable to make serious inroads into the dominance of domestic rivals Sony and Nintendo , had led to retailers scaling down and in some cases discontinuing sales of the Xbox 360 completely .
During the siege of Jerusalem by the First Crusade in 1099 , the Jewish inhabitants of the city fought side by side with the Fatimid garrison and the Muslim population who tried in vain to defend the city against the Crusaders . When the city fell , about 60,000 people were massacred , including 6,000 Jews seeking refuge in a synagogue . At this time , a full thousand years after the fall of the Jewish state , there were Jewish communities all over the country . Fifty of them are known and include Jerusalem , Tiberias , Ramleh , Ashkelon , Caesarea , and Gaza . According to Albert of Aachen , the Jewish residents of Haifa were the main fighting force of the city , and " mixed with Saracen [ Fatimid ] troops " , they fought bravely for close to a month until forced into retreat by the Crusader fleet and land army . However , Joshua Prawer expressed doubt over the story , noting that Albert did not attend the Crusades and that such a prominent role for the Jews is not mentioned by any other source .

Criticism of the War on Terror addresses the issues , morality , efficiency , economics , and other questions surrounding the War on Terror and made against the phrase itself , calling it a misnomer . The notion of a " war " against " terrorism " has proven highly contentious , with critics charging that it has been exploited by participating governments to pursue long-standing policy/military objectives , reduce civil liberties , and infringe upon human rights . It is argued that the term war is not appropriate in this context ( as in War on Drugs ) , since there is no identifiable enemy , and that it is unlikely international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means .
New Delhi lies on several fault lines and thus experiences frequent earthquakes , most of them of mild intensity . There has , however , been a spike in the number of earthquakes in the last six years , most notable being a 5.4 magnitude earthquake in 2015 with its epicentre in Nepal , a 4.7-magnitude earthquake on 25 November 2007 , a 4.2-magnitude earthquake on 7 September 2011 , a 5.2-magnitude earthquake on 5 March 2012 , and a swarm of twelve earthquakes , including four of magnitudes 2.5 , 2.8 , 3.1 , and 3.3 , on 12 November 2013 .

Charleston is the primary medical center for the eastern portion of the state . The city has several major hospitals located in the downtown area : Medical University of South Carolina Medical Center ( MUSC ) , Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center , and Roper Hospital . MUSC is the state 's first school of medicine , the largest medical university in the state , and the sixth-oldest continually operating school of medicine in the United States . The downtown medical district is experiencing rapid growth of biotechnology and medical research industries coupled with substantial expansions of all the major hospitals . Additionally , more expansions are planned or underway at another major hospital located in the West Ashley portion of the city : Bon Secours-St Francis Xavier Hospital . The Trident Regional Medical Center located in the City of North Charleston and East Cooper Regional Medical Center located in Mount Pleasant also serve the needs of residents of the city of Charleston .
The end of the Porfiriato came in 1910 with the beginning of the Mexican Revolution . Díaz had stated that Mexico was ready for democracy and he would step down to allow other candidates to compete for the presidency , but Díaz decided to run again in 1910 for the last time against Francisco I. Madero . During the campaign Díaz incarcerated Madero on election day in 1910 . Díaz was announced the winner of the election by a landslide , triggering the revolution . Madero supporter Toribio Ortega took up arms with a group of followers at Cuchillo Parado , Chihuahua on November 10 , 1910 .
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the ultimate court for criminal and civil matters in England , Wales and Northern Ireland and for civil matters in Scotland . ( The supreme court for criminal matters in Scotland is the High Court of Justiciary . ) The Supreme Court was established by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 with effect from 1 October 2009 , replacing and assuming the judicial functions of the House of Lords . Devolution issues under the Scotland Act 1998 , Government of Wales Act and Northern Ireland Act were also transferred to the new Supreme Court by the Constitutional Reform Act , from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council .
In 1998 , Netscape launched what was to become the Mozilla Foundation in an attempt to produce a competitive browser using the open source software model . That browser would eventually evolve into Firefox , which developed a respectable following while still in the beta stage of development ; shortly after the release of Firefox 1.0 in late 2004 , Firefox ( all versions ) accounted for 7 % of browser use . As of August 2011 , Firefox has a 28 % usage share .
Tucson was probably first visited by Paleo-Indians , known to have been in southern Arizona about 12,000 years ago . Recent archaeological excavations near the Santa Cruz River have located a village site dating from 2100 BC . [ citation needed ] The floodplain of the Santa Cruz River was extensively farmed during the Early Agricultural period , circa 1200 BC to AD 150 . These people constructed irrigation canals and grew corn , beans , and other crops while gathering wild plants and hunting . The Early Ceramic period occupation of Tucson saw the first extensive use of pottery vessels for cooking and storage . The groups designated as the Hohokam lived in the area from AD 600 to 1450 and are known for their vast irrigation canal systems and their red-on-brown pottery . [ citation needed ]
After wrapping up in England , production travelled to Morocco in June , with filming taking place in Oujda , Tangier and Erfoud , after preliminary work was completed by the production 's second unit . An explosion filmed in Morocco holds a Guinness World Record for the " Largest film stunt explosion " in cinematic history , with the record credited to production designer Chris Corbould . Principal photography concluded on 5 July 2015 . A wrap-up party for Spectre was held in commemoration before entering post-production . Filming took 128 days .
Although dance-oriented , electronic pop and ballad-oriented rock dominated the 1980s , soft rock songs still enjoyed a mild success thanks to artists like Sheena Easton , Amy Grant , Lionel Richie , Christopher Cross , Dan Hill , Leo Sayer , Billy Ocean , Julio Iglesias , Bertie Higgins and Tommy Page . No song spent more than six weeks at # 1 on this chart during the 1980s , with nine songs accomplishing that feat . Two of these were by Lionel Richie , " You Are " in 1983 and " Hello " in 1984 , which also reached # 1 on the Hot 100 .
During the early 20th century , northerners were attracted to the city , and Miami prospered during the 1920s with an increase in population and infrastructure . The legacy of Jim Crow was embedded in these developments . Miami 's chief of police , H. Leslie Quigg , did not hide the fact that he , like many other white Miami police officers , was a member of the Ku Klux Klan . Unsurprisingly , these officers enforced social codes far beyond the written law . Quigg , for example , " personally and publicly beat a colored bellboy to death for speaking directly to a white woman . "
Both finalists found success after the show , but Aiken out-performed Studdard 's coronation song " Flying Without Wings " with his single release from the show " This Is the Night " , as well as in their subsequent album releases . The fourth-place finisher Josh Gracin also enjoyed some success as a country singer .
In 1862 , paper money was issued without the backing of precious metals , due to the Civil War . Silver and gold coins continued to be issued and in 1878 the link between paper money and coins was reinstated . This disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the War of 1812 . The use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the Articles of Confederation from 1777 to 1788 . With no solid backing and being easily counterfeited , the continentals quickly lost their value , giving rise to the phrase " not worth a continental " . This was a primary reason for the " No state shall ... make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts " clause in article 1 , section 10 of the United States Constitution .
Meteorites from Antarctica are an important area of study of material formed early in the solar system ; most are thought to come from asteroids , but some may have originated on larger planets . The first meteorite was found in 1912 , and named the Adelie Land meteorite . In 1969 , a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites . Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years . Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges , with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall . Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth , the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved .
Some nations started rocket research before World War II , including for anti-aircraft use . Further research started during the war . The first step was unguided missile systems like the British 2-inch RP and 3-inch , which was fired in large numbers from Z batteries , and were also fitted to warships . The firing of one of these devices during an air raid is suspected to have caused the Bethnal Green disaster in 1943 . Facing the threat of Japanese Kamikaze attacks the British and US developed surface-to-air rockets like British Stooge or the American Lark as counter measures , but none of them were ready at the end of the war . The Germans missile research was the most advanced of the war as the Germans put considerable effort in the research and development of rocket systems for all purposes . Among them were several guided and unguided systems . Unguided systems involved the Fliegerfaust ( literally " aircraft fist " ) as the first MANPADS . Guided systems were several sophisticated radio , wire , or radar guided missiles like the Wasserfall ( " waterfall " ) rocket . Due to the severe war situation for Germany all of those systems were only produced in small numbers and most of them were only used by training or trial units .
In 1989 , Linda Ronstadt released Cry Like a Rainstorm , Howl Like the Wind , described by critics as " the first true Adult Contemporary album of the decade " , featuring American soul singer Aaron Neville on several of the twelve tracks . The album was certified Triple Platinum in the United States alone and became a major success throughout the globe . The Grammy Award-winning singles , " Do n't Know Much " and " All My Life " , were both long-running # 1 Adult Contemporary hits . Several additional singles from the disc made the AC Top 10 as well . The album won over many critics in the need to define AC , and appeared to change the tolerance and acceptance of AC music into mainstream day to day radio play .
The Georgics ' tone wavers between optimism and pessimism , sparking critical debate on the poet 's intentions , but the work lays the foundations for later didactic poetry . Virgil and Maecenas are said to have taken turns reading the Georgics to Octavian upon his return from defeating Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC .
The Age of Enlightenment was preceded by and closely associated with the scientific revolution . Earlier philosophers whose work influenced the Enlightenment included Francis Bacon , Descartes , Locke , and Spinoza . The major figures of the Enlightenment included Cesare Beccaria , Voltaire , Denis Diderot , Jean-Jacques Rousseau , David Hume , Adam Smith , and Immanuel Kant . Some European rulers , including Catherine II of Russia , Joseph II of Austria and Frederick I of Prussia , tried to apply Enlightenment thought on religious and political tolerance , which became known as enlightened absolutism . The Americans Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson came to Europe during the period and contributed actively to the scientific and political debate , and the ideals of the Enlightenment were incorporated into the United States Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States .
Uranium metal reacts with almost all non-metal elements ( with an exception of the noble gases ) and their compounds , with reactivity increasing with temperature . Hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium , but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly . When finely divided , it can react with cold water ; in air , uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide . Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry .
Because the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials , a given bipolar n–p–n transistor tends to be swifter than an equivalent p–n–p transistor . GaAs has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors . It is for this reason that GaAs is used in high-frequency applications . A relatively recent FET development , the high-electron-mobility transistor ( HEMT ) , has a heterostructure ( junction between different semiconductor materials ) of aluminium gallium arsenide ( AlGaAs ) -gallium arsenide ( GaAs ) which has twice the electron mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction . Because of their high speed and low noise , HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12 GHz . HEMTs based on gallium nitride and aluminium gallium nitride ( AlGaN/GaN HEMTs ) provide a still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications .
People from Plymouth are known as Plymothians or less formally as Janners . Its meaning is described as a person from Devon , deriving from Cousin Jan ( the Devon form of John ) , but more particularly in naval circles anyone from the Plymouth area .
British post-punk entered the 1980s with support from members of the critical community—American critic Greil Marcus characterised " Britain 's postpunk pop avant-garde " in a 1980 Rolling Stone article as " sparked by a tension , humour and sense of paradox plainly unique in present day pop music " —as well as media figures such as BBC DJ John Peel , while several groups , such as PiL and Joy Division , achieved some success in the popular charts . The network of supportive record labels that included Industrial , Fast , E.G. , Mute , Axis/4AD and Glass continued to facilitate a large output of music , by artists such as the Raincoats , Essential Logic , Killing Joke , the Teardrop Explodes , and the Psychedelic Furs .
In the 1874 general election , Disraeli was returned to power . He passed the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874 , which removed Catholic rituals from the Anglican liturgy and which Victoria strongly supported . She preferred short , simple services , and personally considered herself more aligned with the presbyterian Church of Scotland than the episcopal Church of England . He also pushed the Royal Titles Act 1876 through Parliament , so that Victoria took the title " Empress of India " from 1 May 1876 . The new title was proclaimed at the Delhi Durbar of 1 January 1877 .
For all iPods released in 2006 and earlier , some equalizer ( EQ ) sound settings would distort the bass sound far too easily , even on undemanding songs . This would happen for EQ settings like R & B , Rock , Acoustic , and Bass Booster , because the equalizer amplified the digital audio level beyond the software 's limit , causing distortion ( clipping ) on bass instruments .
U.S. submarines , as well as some British and Dutch vessels , operating from bases at Cavite in the Philippines ( 1941–42 ) ; Fremantle and Brisbane , Australia ; Pearl Harbor ; Trincomalee , Ceylon ; Midway ; and later Guam , played a major role in defeating Japan , even though submarines made up a small proportion of the Allied navies—less than two percent in the case of the US Navy . Submarines strangled Japan by sinking its merchant fleet , intercepting many troop transports , and cutting off nearly all the oil imports essential to weapons production and military operations . By early 1945 Japanese oil supplies were so limited that its fleet was virtually stranded .
On 12 March 1999 , the Czech Republic , Hungary , and Poland joined NATO ; Bulgaria , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Romania , and Slovakia joined in March 2004 ; Albania joined on 1 April 2009 .
In 1637 a small party of Puritans reconnoitered the New Haven harbor area and wintered over . In April 1638 , the main party of five hundred Puritans who left the Massachusetts Bay Colony under the leadership of the Reverend John Davenport and the London merchant Theophilus Eaton sailed into the harbor . These settlers were hoping to establish a ( in their mind ) better theological community , with the government more closely linked to the church than the one they left in Massachusetts and sought to take advantage of the excellent port capabilities of the harbor . The Quinnipiacs , who were under attack by neighboring Pequots , sold their land to the settlers in return for protection .
Differences in feasts may also originate from doctrinal issues—the Feast of the Assumption is such an example . Given that there is no agreement among all Christians on the circumstances of the death , Dormition or Assumption of Mary , the feast of assumption is celebrated among some denominations and not others . While the Catholic Church celebrates the Feast of the Assumption on August 15 , some Eastern Catholics celebrate it as Dormition of the Theotokos , and may do so on August 28 , if they follow the Julian calendar . The Eastern Orthodox also celebrate it as the Dormition of the Theotokos , one of their 12 Great Feasts . Protestants do not celebrate this , or any other Marian feasts .
At the University of Manchester , a team under the leadership of Tom Kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves . Their first transistorised computer and the first in the world , was operational by 1953 , and a second version was completed there in April 1955 . However , the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125 kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory , so it was not the first completely transistorized computer . That distinction goes to the Harwell CADET of 1955 , built by the electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell .
Several churches and monasteries were built inside , or close to , the city of Utrecht . The most dominant of these was the Cathedral of Saint Martin , inside the old Roman fortress . The construction of the present Gothic building was begun in 1254 after an earlier romanesque construction had been badly damaged by fire . The choir and transept were finished from 1320 and were followed then by the ambitious Dom tower . The last part to be constructed was the central nave , from 1420 . By that time , however , the age of the great cathedrals had come to an end and declining finances prevented the ambitious project from being finished , the construction of the central nave being suspended before the planned flying buttresses could be finished . Besides the cathedral there were four collegiate churches in Utrecht : St. Salvator 's Church ( demolished in the 16th century ) , on the Dom square , dating back to the early 8th century . Saint John ( Janskerk ) , originating in 1040 ; Saint Peter , building started in 1039 and Saint Mary 's church building started around 1090 ( demolished in the early 19th century , cloister survives ) . Besides these churches the city housed St. Paul 's Abbey , the 15th-century beguinage of St. Nicholas , and a 14th-century chapter house of the Teutonic Knights .
The Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden is home to numerous natural habitats , WPA era architecture and landscaping , and hosts major touring concerts during the summer at its amphitheater . Oklahoma City also has two amusement parks , Frontier City theme park and White Water Bay water park . Frontier City is an 'Old West'-themed amusement park . The park also features a recreation of a western gunfight at the 'OK Corral ' and many shops that line the " Western " town 's main street . Frontier City also hosts a national concert circuit at its amphitheater during the summer . Oklahoma City also has a combination racetrack and casino open year-round , Remington Park , which hosts both Quarter horse ( March – June ) and Thoroughbred ( August – December ) seasons .
Rebirth refers to a process whereby beings go through a succession of lifetimes as one of many possible forms of sentient life , each running from conception to death . The doctrine of anattā ( Sanskrit anātman ) rejects the concepts of a permanent self or an unchanging , eternal soul , as it is called in Hinduism and Christianity . According to Buddhism there ultimately is no such thing as a self independent from the rest of the universe . Buddhists also refer to themselves as the believers of the anatta doctrine—Nairatmyavadin or Anattavadin . Rebirth in subsequent existences must be understood as the continuation of a dynamic , ever-changing process of pratītyasamutpāda ( " dependent arising " ) determined by the laws of cause and effect ( karma ) rather than that of one being , reincarnating from one existence to the next .
The Period of Division from , A.D. , 1138 – A.D. , 1314 , which included nearly 200 years of feudal fragmentation and which stemmed from Bolesław III 's division of Poland among his sons , was the genesis of the social structure which saw the economic elevation of the great landowning feudal nobles ( możni/Magnates , both ecclesiastical and lay ) from the rycerstwo they originated from . The prior social structure was one of Polish tribes united into the historic Polish nation under a state ruled by the Piast dynasty , this dynasty appearing circa 850 A.D .
The study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology , as kinship is a human universal . Sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization , law and conflict resolution , patterns of consumption and exchange , material culture , technology , infrastructure , gender relations , ethnicity , childrearing and socialization , religion , myth , symbols , values , etiquette , worldview , sports , music , nutrition , recreation , games , food , festivals , and language ( which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology ) .
In 1795 , the First Russian Orthodox Church was established in Kodiak . Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped the Russian immigrants integrate into society . As a result , an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches gradually became established within Alaska . Alaska also has the largest Quaker population ( by percentage ) of any state . In 2009 there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska ( for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems ) . Alaskan Hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities , including Sikhs and Jains .
Assistive listening devices in many theaters and similar spaces use arrays of infrared LEDs to send sound to listeners ' receivers . Light-emitting diodes ( as well as semiconductor lasers ) are used to send data over many types of fiber optic cable , from digital audio over TOSLINK cables to the very high bandwidth fiber links that form the Internet backbone . For some time , computers were commonly equipped with IrDA interfaces , which allowed them to send and receive data to nearby machines via infrared .
The motor centers of reptiles react to sensory cues of vision , sound , touch , chemical , gravity , and motion with pre-set body movements and programmed postures . With the arrival of night-active mammals , smell replaced vision as the dominant sense , and a different way of responding arose from the olfactory sense , which is proposed to have developed into mammalian emotion and emotional memory . The mammalian brain invested heavily in olfaction to succeed at night as reptiles slept—one explanation for why olfactory lobes in mammalian brains are proportionally larger than in the reptiles . These odor pathways gradually formed the neural blueprint for what was later to become our limbic brain .
BBC TV was renamed BBC1 in 1964 , after the launch of BBC2 ( now BBC Two ) , the third television station ( ITV was the second ) for the UK ; its remit , to provide more niche programming . The channel was due to launch on 20 April 1964 , but was put off the air by a massive power failure that affected much of London , caused by a fire at Battersea Power Station . A videotape made on the opening night was rediscovered in 2003 by a BBC technician . In the end the launch went ahead the following night , hosted by Denis Tuohy holding a candle . BBC2 was the first British channel to use UHF and 625-line pictures , giving higher definition than the existing VHF 405-line system .
The Sell Assessment of Sexual Orientation ( SASO ) was developed to address the major concerns with the Kinsey Scale and Klein Sexual Orientation Grid and as such , measures sexual orientation on a continuum , considers various dimensions of sexual orientation , and considers homosexuality and heterosexuality separately . Rather than providing a final solution to the question of how to best measure sexual orientation , the SASO is meant to provoke discussion and debate about measurements of sexual orientation .
The development of writing enabled knowledge to be stored and communicated across generations with much greater fidelity . Combined with the development of agriculture , which allowed for a surplus of food , it became possible for early civilizations to develop , because more time and effort could be devoted to tasks ( other than food production ) than hunter-gatherers or early subsistence farmers had available . This surplus allowed a community to support individuals who did things other than work towards bare survival . These other tasks included systematic studies of nature , study of written information gathered and recorded by others , and often of adding to that body of information .
In 2005 two city council members , Ralph Inzunza and Deputy Mayor Michael Zucchet – who briefly took over as acting mayor when Murphy resigned – were convicted of extortion , wire fraud , and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for taking campaign contributions from a strip club owner and his associates , allegedly in exchange for trying to repeal the city 's " no touch " laws at strip clubs . Both subsequently resigned . Inzunza was sentenced to 21 months in prison . In 2009 , a judge acquitted Zucchet on seven out of the nine counts against him , and granted his petition for a new trial on the other two charges ; the remaining charges were eventually dropped .
Houston was incorporated in 1837 under the ward system of representation . The ward designation is the progenitor of the eleven current-day geographically oriented Houston City Council districts . Locations in Houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside the Interstate 610 Loop . The inside encompasses the central business district and many residential neighborhoods that predate World War II . More recently , high-density residential areas have been developed within the loop . The city 's outlying areas , suburbs and enclaves are located outside of the loop . Beltway 8 encircles the city another 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) farther out .
Everton regularly take large numbers away from home both domestically and in European fixtures . The club implements a loyalty points scheme offering the first opportunity to purchase away tickets to season ticket holders who have attended the most away matches . Everton often sell out the full allocation in away grounds and tickets sell particularly well for North West England away matches . In October 2009 , Everton took 7,000 travelling fans to Benfica , their largest ever away crowd in Europe since the 1985 European Cup Winners ' Cup Final .
Richmond has several historic churches . Because of its early English colonial history from the early 17th century to 1776 , Richmond has a number of prominent Anglican/Episcopal churches including Monumental Church , St. Paul 's Episcopal Church and St. John 's Episcopal Church . Methodists and Baptists made up another section of early churches , and First Baptist Church of Richmond was the first of these , established in 1780 . In the Reformed church tradition , the first Presbyterian Church in the City of Richmond was First Presbyterian Church , organized on June 18 , 1812 . On February 5 , 1845 , Second Presbyterian Church of Richmond was founded , which was a historic church where Stonewall Jackson attended and was the first Gothic building and the first gas-lit church to be built in Richmond . St. Peter 's Church was dedicated and became the first Catholic church in Richmond on May 25 , 1834 . The city is also home to the historic Cathedral of the Sacred Heart which is the motherchurch for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond .
Treaties can be loosely compared to contracts : both are means of willing parties assuming obligations among themselves , and a party to either that fails to live up to their obligations can be held liable under international law .
The range is mostly located in the United States but extends into southeastern Canada , forming a zone from 100 to 300 mi ( 160 to 480 km ) wide , running from the island of Newfoundland 1,500 mi ( 2,400 km ) southwestward to Central Alabama in the United States . [ discuss ] The range covers parts of the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , which comprise an overseas territory of France . The system is divided into a series of ranges , with the individual mountains averaging around 3,000 ft ( 910 m ) . The highest of the group is Mount Mitchell in North Carolina at 6,684 feet ( 2,037 m ) , which is the highest point in the United States east of the Mississippi River .
Saint Athanasius of Alexandria ( /ˌæθəˈneɪʃəs/ ; Greek : Ἀθανάσιος Ἀλεξανδρείας , Athanásios Alexandrías ; c. 296–298 – 2 May 373 ) , also called Athanasius the Great , Athanasius the Confessor or , primarily in the Coptic Orthodox Church , Athanasius the Apostolic , was the twentieth bishop of Alexandria ( as Athanasius I ) . His episcopate lasted 45 years ( c. 8 June 328 – 2 May 373 ) , of which over 17 were spent in five exiles ordered by four different Roman emperors . Athanasius is a renowned Christian theologian , a Church Father , the chief defender of Trinitarianism against Arianism , and a noted Egyptian leader of the fourth century .
In order not to let the routine administration take over the running of the empire , the Qing emperors made sure that all important matters were decided in the " Inner Court , " which was dominated by the imperial family and Manchu nobility and which was located in the northern part of the Forbidden City . The core institution of the inner court was the Grand Council . [ g ] It emerged in the 1720s under the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor as a body charged with handling Qing military campaigns against the Mongols , but it soon took over other military and administrative duties and served to centralize authority under the crown . The Grand Councillors [ h ] served as a sort of privy council to the emperor .
Bacteria often attach to surfaces and form dense aggregations called biofilms or bacterial mats . These films can range from a few micrometers in thickness to up to half a meter in depth , and may contain multiple species of bacteria , protists and archaea . Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components , forming secondary structures , such as microcolonies , through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients . In natural environments , such as soil or the surfaces of plants , the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms . Biofilms are also important in medicine , as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of implanted medical devices , and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria .
Chapter I covers animal husbandry and plant breeding , going back to ancient Egypt . Darwin discusses contemporary opinions on the origins of different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by selective breeding . As an illustration of artificial selection , he describes fancy pigeon breeding , noting that " [ t ] he diversity of the breeds is something astonishing " , yet all were descended from one species of rock pigeon . Darwin saw two distinct kinds of variation : ( 1 ) rare abrupt changes he called " sports " or " monstrosities " ( example : ancon sheep with short legs ) , and ( 2 ) ubiquitous small differences ( example : slightly shorter or longer bill of pigeons ) . Both types of hereditary changes can be used by breeders . However , for Darwin the small changes were most important in evolution .
Iran has leading manufacturing industries in the fields of car-manufacture and transportation , construction materials , home appliances , food and agricultural goods , armaments , pharmaceuticals , information technology , power and petrochemicals in the Middle East . According to FAO , Iran has been a top five producer of the following agricultural products in the world in 2012 : apricots , cherries , sour cherries , cucumbers and gherkins , dates , eggplants , figs , pistachios , quinces , walnuts , and watermelons .
In July 2013 , there were 41,000 non-Germans by citizenship living in Thuringia ( 1.9 % of the population − among the smallest proportions of any state in Germany ) . Nevertheless , the number rose from 33,000 in July 2011 , an increase of 24 % in only two years . About 4 % of the population are migrants ( including persons that already received the German citizenship ) . The biggest groups of foreigners by citizenship are ( as of 2012 ) : Russians ( 3,100 ) , Poles ( 3,000 ) , Vietnamese ( 2,800 ) , Turks ( 2,100 ) and Ukrainians ( 2,000 ) . The amount of foreigners varies between regions : the college towns Erfurt , Jena , Weimar and Ilmenau have the highest rates , whereas there are almost no migrants living in the most rural smaller municipalities .
If current trends continue , missiles will replace gun systems completely in " first line " service . [ citation needed ] Guns are being increasingly pushed into specialist roles , such as the Dutch Goalkeeper CIWS , which uses the GAU-8 Avenger 30 mm seven-barrel Gatling gun for last ditch anti-missile and anti-aircraft defence . Even this formerly front-line weapon is currently being replaced by new missile systems , such as the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile , which is smaller , faster , and allows for mid-flight course correction ( guidance ) to ensure a hit . To bridge the gap between guns and missiles , Russia in particular produces the Kashtan CIWS , which uses both guns and missiles for final defence . Two six-barrelled 30 mm Gsh-6-30 Gatling guns and 9M311 surface-to-air missiles provide for its defensive capabilities .
18th Street has a local subway station at the crossing with Seventh Avenue , served by the 1 2 trains on the IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line . There used to be an 18th Street station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line at the crossing with Park Avenue South .
In the vaulting events , gymnasts sprint down a 25 metres ( 82 ft ) runway , jump onto a spring filled board or perform a roundoff , or handspring entry onto a springboard ( run/ take-off segment ) , land momentarily , inverted on the hands on the vaulting horse , or vaulting table ( pre flight segment ) , then propel themselves forward or backward , off of this platform to a two footed landing ( post flight segment ) . Every gymnast starts at a different point on the vault runway depending on their height and strength . The post flight segment may include one or more multiple saltos or somersaults , and/or twisting movements . A round-off entry vault , called a Yurchenko , is the most common vault in elite level gymnastics . When performing a yurchenko , gymnasts " round-off " so hands are on the runway while the feet land on the springboard ( beatboard ) . From the roundoff position the gymnast travels backwards and executes a backhandspring so that the hands land on the vaulting table . The gymnast then blocks off the vaulting platform into various twisting and/or somersaulting combinations . The post flight segment brings the gymnast to her feet .
While the book was readable enough to sell , its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists and could not be dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction . Unlike the still-popular Vestiges , it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation , though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression . Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science , and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments . David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience , but noted that Darwin 's literary style was uneven : in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read , while in other places his writing was beautiful . Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics , and recommended the first edition . James T. Costa said that because the book was an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace 's essay , it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on , which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail . He added that some parts of Origin are dense , but other parts are almost lyrical , and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books , which broadened its audience .
In the late 17th century , Gottfried Leibniz proposed the idea of the Latin : vis viva , or living force , which defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared ; he believed that total vis viva was conserved . To account for slowing due to friction , Leibniz theorized that thermal energy consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter , a view shared by Isaac Newton , although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted . The modern analog of this property , kinetic energy , differs from vis viva only by a factor of two .
Viking invasions began in the 9th century , followed by more permanent settlements , particularly along the east coast of Ireland , the west coast of modern-day Scotland and the Isle of Man . Though the Vikings were eventually neutralised in Ireland , their influence remained in the cities of Dublin , Cork , Limerick , Waterford and Wexford . England however was slowly conquered around the turn of the first millennium AD , and eventually became a feudal possession of Denmark . The relations between the descendants of Vikings in England and counterparts in Normandy , in northern France , lay at the heart of a series of events that led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066 . The remnants of the Duchy of Normandy , which conquered England , remain associated to the English Crown as the Channel Islands to this day . A century later the marriage of the future Henry II of England to Eleanor of Aquitaine created the Angevin Empire , partially under the French Crown . At the invitation of a provincial king and under the authority of Pope Adrian IV ( the only Englishman to be elected pope ) , the Angevins invaded Ireland in 1169 . Though initially intended to be kept as an independent kingdom , the failure of the Irish High King to ensure the terms of the Treaty of Windsor led Henry II , as King of England , to rule as effective monarch under the title of Lord of Ireland . This title was granted to his younger son but when Henry 's heir unexpectedly died the title of King of England and Lord of Ireland became entwined in one person .
Aeromedical Evacuation is " the movement of patients under medical supervision to and between medical treatment facilities by air transportation " ( JP 1-02 ) . JP 4-02 , Health Service Support , further defines it as " the fixed wing movement of regulated casualties to and between medical treatment facilities , using organic and/or contracted mobility airframes , with aircrew trained explicitly for this mission . " Aeromedical evacuation forces can operate as far forward as fixed-wing aircraft are able to conduct airland operations .
The confusion may stem from the fact that Major League Baseball did decide that , should the Cubs make it to the World Series , the American League winner would have home field advantage unless the Cubs hosted home games at an alternate site since the Cubs home field of Wrigley Field did not yet have lights . Rumor was the Cubs could hold home games across town at Comiskey Park , home of the American League 's Chicago White Sox . Rather than hold any games in the cross town rival Sox Park , the Cubs made arrangements with the August A. Busch , owner of the St. Louis Cardinals , to use Busch Stadium in St. Louis as the Cubs " home field " for the World Series . This was approved by Major League Baseball and would have enabled the Cubs to host games 1 and 2 , along with games 6 and 7 if necessary . At the time home field advantage was rotated between each league . Odd numbered years the AL had home field advantage . Even numbered years the NL had home field advantage . In the 1982 World Series the St. Louis Cardinals of the NL had home field advantage . In the 1983 World Series the Baltimore Orioles of the AL had home field advantage .
In 2008 , biochemist Boris Arkadievich Malyarchuk ( Russian : Борис Аркадьевич Малярчук ) et al . of the Institute of Biological Problems of the North , Russian Academy of Sciences , Magadan , Russia , used a sample ( n=279 ) of Czech individuals to determine the frequency of " Mongoloid " " mtDNA lineages " . Malyarchuk found Czech mtDNA lineages were typical of " Slavic populations " with " 1.8 % " Mongoloid mtDNA lineage . Malyarchuk added that " Slavic populations " " almost always " contain Mongoloid mtDNA lineage . Malyarchuk said the Mongoloid component of Slavic people was partially added before the split of " Balto-Slavics " in 2,000–3,000 BC with additional Mongoloid mixture occurring among Slavics in the last 4,000 years . Malyarchuk said the " Russian population " was developed by the " assimilation of the indigenous pre-Slavic population of Eastern Europe by true Slavs " with additional " assimilation of Finno-Ugric populations " and " long-lasting " interactions with the populations of " Siberia " and " Central Asia " . Malyarchuk said that other Slavs " Mongoloid component " was increased during the waves of migration from " steppe populations ( Huns , Avars , Bulgars and Mongols ) " , especially the decay of the " Avar Khaganate " .
Switzerland has one of the best environmental records among nations in the developed world ; it was one of the countries to sign the Kyoto Protocol in 1998 and ratified it in 2003 . With Mexico and the Republic of Korea it forms the Environmental Integrity Group ( EIG ) . The country is heavily active in recycling and anti-littering regulations and is one of the top recyclers in the world , with 66 % to 96 % of recyclable materials being recycled , depending on the area of the country . The 2014 Global Green Economy Index ranked Switzerland among the top 10 green economies in the world .
In the years to follow , public revelations on the state of Charles and Diana 's marriage continued . Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher than at any time in living memory , republicanism was still a minority viewpoint , and the Queen herself had high approval ratings . Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the Queen 's wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions . In consultation with her husband and the Prime Minister , John Major , as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury , George Carey , and her private secretary , Robert Fellowes , she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995 , saying that a divorce was desirable .
In 1838 , Claridge obtained patents in Scotland on 27 March , and Ireland on 23 April , and in 1851 extensions were sought for all three patents , by the trustees of a company previously formed by Claridge . This was Claridge 's Patent Asphalte Company , formed in 1838 for the purpose of introducing to Britain " Asphalte in its natural state from the mine at Pyrimont Seysell in France " , and " laid one of the first asphalt pavements in Whitehall " . Trials were made of the pavement in 1838 on the footway in Whitehall , the stable at Knightsbridge Barracks , " and subsequently on the space at the bottom of the steps leading from Waterloo Place to St. James Park " . " The formation in 1838 of Claridge 's Patent Asphalte Company ( with a distinguished list of aristocratic patrons , and Marc and Isambard Brunel as , respectively , a trustee and consulting engineer ) , gave an enormous impetus to the development of a British asphalt industry " . " By the end of 1838 , at least two other companies , Robinson 's and the Bastenne company , were in production " , with asphalt being laid as paving at Brighton , Herne Bay , Canterbury , Kensington , the Strand , and a large floor area in Bunhill-row , while meantime Claridge 's Whitehall paving " continue ( d ) in good order " .
At the time the store was introduced , purchased audio files used the AAC format with added encryption , based on the FairPlay DRM system . Up to five authorized computers and an unlimited number of iPods could play the files . Burning the files with iTunes as an audio CD , then re-importing would create music files without the DRM . The DRM could also be removed using third-party software . However , in a deal with Apple , EMI began selling DRM-free , higher-quality songs on the iTunes Stores , in a category called " iTunes Plus . " While individual songs were made available at a cost of US $ 1.29 , 30¢ more than the cost of a regular DRM song , entire albums were available for the same price , US $ 9.99 , as DRM encoded albums . On October 17 , 2007 , Apple lowered the cost of individual iTunes Plus songs to US $ 0.99 per song , the same as DRM encoded tracks . On January 6 , 2009 , Apple announced that DRM has been removed from 80 % of the music catalog , and that it would be removed from all music by April 2009 .
An adolescent 's environment plays a huge role in their identity development . While most adolescent studies are conducted on white , middle class children , studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have , the more successfully they develop their identity . The forming of an adolescent 's identity is a crucial time in their life . It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century . Accordingly , youth , a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood , has become a more prominent stage of the life course . This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development . So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment , to coping devices , to social media . All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in . A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general . An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development . Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process , and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions . While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful identity development .
When Cowan Powers and his family recorded their old-time music from 1924-1926 , his daughter Orpha Powers was one of the earliest known southern-music artists to record with the mandolin . By the 1930s , single mandolins were becoming more commonly used in southern string band music , most notably by brother duets such as the sedate Blue Sky Boys ( Bill Bolick and Earl Bolick ) and the more hard-driving Monroe Brothers ( Bill Monroe and Charlie Monroe ) . However , the mandolin 's modern popularity in country music can be directly traced to one man : Bill Monroe , the father of bluegrass music . After the Monroe Brothers broke up in 1939 , Bill Monroe formed his own group , after a brief time called the Blue Grass Boys , and completed the transition of mandolin styles from a " parlor " sound typical of brother duets to the modern " bluegrass " style . He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1939 and its powerful clear-channel broadcast signal on WSM-AM spread his style throughout the South , directly inspiring many musicians to take up the mandolin . Monroe famously played Gibson F-5 mandolin , signed and dated July 9 , 1923 , by Lloyd Loar , chief acoustic engineer at Gibson . The F-5 has since become the most imitated tonally and aesthetically by modern builders .
In 2007 , however , a large current account deficit and rising inflation put pressure on Estonia 's currency , which was pegged to the Euro , highlighting the need for growth in export-generating industries . Estonia exports mainly machinery and equipment , wood and paper , textiles , food products , furniture , and metals and chemical products . Estonia also exports 1.562 billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually . At the same time Estonia imports machinery and equipment , chemical products , textiles , food products and transportation equipment . Estonia imports 200 million kilowatt hours of electricity annually .
Uranium metal reacts with almost all non-metal elements ( with an exception of the noble gases ) and their compounds , with reactivity increasing with temperature . Hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium , but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly . When finely divided , it can react with cold water ; in air , uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide . Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry .
By about 6000 BC , a Neolithic culture rooted in the Nile Valley . During the Neolithic era , several predynastic cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt . The Badarian culture and the successor Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to dynastic Egypt . The earliest known Lower Egyptian site , Merimda , predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years . Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years , remaining culturally distinct , but maintaining frequent contact through trade . The earliest known evidence of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels , dated to about 3200 BC .
New Haven has a variety of museums , many of them associated with Yale . The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library features an original copy of the Gutenberg Bible . There is also the Connecticut Children 's Museum ; the Knights of Columbus museum near that organization 's world headquarters ; the Peabody Museum of Natural History ; the Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments ; the Eli Whitney Museum ( across the town line in Hamden , Connecticut , on Whitney Avenue ) ; the Yale Center for British Art , which houses the largest collection of British art outside the U.K. , and the Yale University Art Gallery , the nation 's oldest college art museum . [ citation needed ] New Haven is also home to the New Haven Museum and Historical Society on Whitney Avenue , which has a library of many primary source treasures dating from Colonial times to the present .
The structure of Bern 's city centre is largely medieval and has been recognised by UNESCO as a Cultural World Heritage Site . Perhaps its most famous sight is the Zytglogge ( Bernese German for " Time Bell " ) , an elaborate medieval clock tower with moving puppets . It also has an impressive 15th century Gothic cathedral , the Münster , and a 15th-century town hall . Thanks to 6 kilometres ( 4 miles ) of arcades , the old town boasts one of the longest covered shopping promenades in Europe .
The Swiss Federal budget had a size of 62.8 billion Swiss francs in 2010 , which is an equivalent 11.35 % of the country 's GDP in that year ; however , the regional ( canton ) budgets and the budgets of the municipalities are not counted as part of the federal budget and the total rate of government spending is closer to 33.8 % of GDP . The main sources of income for the federal government are the value-added tax ( 33 % ) and the direct federal tax ( 29 % ) and the main expenditure is located in the areas of social welfare and finance & tax . The expenditures of the Swiss Confederation have been growing from 7 % of GDP in 1960 to 9.7 % in 1990 and to 10.7 % in 2010 . While the sectors social welfare and finance & tax have been growing from 35 % in 1990 to 48.2 % in 2010 , a significant reduction of expenditures has been occurring in the sectors of agriculture and national defense ; from 26.5 % in to 12.4 % ( estimation for the year 2015 ) .
After 1870 , the new railroads across the Plains brought hunters who killed off almost all the bison for their hides . The railroads offered attractive packages of land and transportation to European farmers , who rushed to settle the land . They ( and Americans as well ) also took advantage of the homestead laws to obtain free farms . Land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns , and those reached by the railroad had a chance , while the others became ghost towns . In Kansas , for example , nearly 5000 towns were mapped out , but by 1970 only 617 were actually operating . In the mid-20th century , closeness to an interstate exchange determined whether a town would flourish or struggle for business .
IndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrower’s income or assets , and to borrowers with poor credit histories . Appraisals obtained by IndyMac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well . As an Alt-A lender , IndyMac’s business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower’s needs , using an extensive array of risky option-adjustable-rate-mortgages ( option ARMs ) , subprime loans , 80/20 loans , and other nontraditional products . Ultimately , loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments . The thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the secondary mortgage market . IndyMac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria : see the comment by Ruthann Melbourne , Chief Risk Officer , to the regulating agencies .
The key characteristic of classical music that distinguishes it from popular music and folk music is that the repertoire tends to be written down in musical notation , creating a musical part or score . This score typically determines details of rhythm , pitch , and , where two or more musicians ( whether singers or instrumentalists ) are involved , how the various parts are coordinated . The written quality of the music has enabled a high level of complexity within them : J.S . Bach 's fugues , for instance , achieve a remarkable marriage of boldly distinctive melodic lines weaving in counterpoint yet creating a coherent harmonic logic that would be impossible in the heat of live improvisation . The use of written notation also preserves a record of the works and enables Classical musicians to perform music from many centuries ago . Musical notation enables 2000s-era performers to sing a choral work from the 1300s Renaissance era or a 1700s Baroque concerto with many of the features of the music ( the melodies , lyrics , forms , and rhythms ) being reproduced .
The principal gods of the ancient Greek religion were the Dodekatheon , or the Twelve Gods , who lived on the top of Mount Olympus . The most important of all ancient Greek gods was Zeus , the king of the gods , who was married to Hera , who was also Zeus 's sister . The other Greek gods that made up the Twelve Olympians were Demeter , Ares , Poseidon , Athena , Dionysus , Apollo , Artemis , Aphrodite , Hephaestus and Hermes . Apart from these twelve gods , Greeks also had a variety of other mystical beliefs , such as nymphs and other magical creatures .
Alphanumeric LEDs are available in seven-segment , starburst and dot-matrix format . Seven-segment displays handle all numbers and a limited set of letters . Starburst displays can display all letters . Dot-matrix displays typically use 5x7 pixels per character . Seven-segment LED displays were in widespread use in the 1970s and 1980s , but rising use of liquid crystal displays , with their lower power needs and greater display flexibility , has reduced the popularity of numeric and alphanumeric LED displays .
According to some historians , Bismarck adroitly created a diplomatic crisis over the succession to the Spanish throne , then edited a dispatch about a meeting between King William of Prussia and the French ambassador , to make it appear that the French had been insulted . The French press and parliament demanded a war , which the generals of Napoleon III assured him that France would win . Napoleon and his Prime Minister , Émile Ollivier , for their parts sought war to solve their problems with political disunity in France . On 16 July 1870 , the French parliament voted to declare war on the German Kingdom of Prussia and hostilities began three days later . The German coalition mobilised its troops much more quickly than the French and rapidly invaded northeastern France . The German forces were superior in numbers , had better training and leadership and made more effective use of modern technology , particularly railroads and artillery .
In absolute terms , the planet has lost 52 % of its biodiversity since 1970 according to a 2014 study by the World Wildlife Fund . The Living Planet Report 2014 claims that " the number of mammals , birds , reptiles , amphibians and fish across the globe is , on average , about half the size it was 40 years ago " . Of that number , 39 % accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone , 39 % for the marine wildlife gone , and 76 % for the freshwater wildlife gone . Biodiversity took the biggest hit in Latin America , plummeting 83 percent . High-income countries showed a 10 % increase in biodiversity , which was canceled out by a loss in low-income countries . This is despite the fact that high-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries , which was explained as a result of process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion to poorer nations , which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses .
In 2007 , the Institute for Policy Innovation ( IPI ) reported that music piracy took $ 12.5 billion from the U.S. economy . According to the study , musicians and those involved in the recording industry are not the only ones who experience losses attributed to music piracy . Retailers have lost over a billion dollars , while piracy has resulted in 46,000 fewer production-level jobs and almost 25,000 retail jobs . The U.S. government was also reported to suffer from music piracy , losing $ 422 million in tax revenue .
At the end of the 16th century , the Aussa Sultanate was established in the Denkel lowlands of Eritrea . The polity had come into existence in 1577 , when Muhammed Jasa moved his capital from Harar to Aussa ( Asaita ) with the split of the Adal Sultanate into Aussa and the Sultanate of Harar . At some point after 1672 , Aussa declined in conjunction with Imam Umar Din bin Adam 's recorded ascension to the throne . In 1734 , the Afar leader Kedafu , head of the Mudaito clan , seized power and established the Mudaito Dynasty . This marked the start of a new and more sophisticated polity that would last into the colonial period .
The Gregorian calendar was a reform of the Julian calendar instituted in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII , after whom the calendar was named , by papal bull Inter gravissimas dated 24 February 1582 . The motivation for the adjustment was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter to the time of year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church . Although a recommendation of the First Council of Nicaea in 325 specified that all Christians should celebrate Easter on the same day , it took almost five centuries before virtually all Christians achieved that objective by adopting the rules of the Church of Alexandria ( see Easter for the issues which arose ) .
In 1971 , Akira Endo , a Japanese biochemist working for the pharmaceutical company Sankyo , identified mevastatin ( ML-236B ) , a molecule produced by the fungus Penicillium citrinum , as an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase , a critical enzyme used by the body to produce cholesterol . Animal trials showed very good inhibitory effect as in clinical trials , however a long term study in dogs found toxic effects at higher doses and as a result mevastatin was believed to be too toxic for human use . Mevastatin was never marketed , because of its adverse effects of tumors , muscle deterioration , and sometimes death in laboratory dogs .
However , since the 20th century , indigenous peoples in the Americas have been more vocal about the ways they wish to be referred to , pressing for the elimination of terms widely considered to be obsolete , inaccurate , or racist . During the latter half of the 20th century and the rise of the Indian rights movement , the United States government responded by proposing the use of the term " Native American , " to recognize the primacy of indigenous peoples ' tenure in the nation , but this term was not fully accepted . Other naming conventions have been proposed and used , but none are accepted by all indigenous groups .
Alaska regularly supports Republicans in presidential elections and has done so since statehood . Republicans have won the state 's electoral college votes in all but one election that it has participated in ( 1964 ) . No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times . Alaska was carried by Democratic nominee Lyndon B. Johnson during his landslide election in 1964 , while the 1960 and 1968 elections were close . Since 1972 , however , Republicans have carried the state by large margins . In 2008 , Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama in Alaska , 59.49 % to 37.83 % . McCain 's running mate was Sarah Palin , the state 's governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket . Obama lost Alaska again in 2012 , but he captured 40 % of the state 's vote in that election , making him the first Democrat to do so since 1968 .
Philadelphia 's an annualized unemployment rate was 7.8 % in 2014 , down from 10.0 % the previous year . This is higher than the national average of 6.2 % . Similarly , the rate of new jobs added to the city 's economy lagged behind the national job growth . In 2014 , about 8,800 jobs were added to the city 's economy . Sectors with the largest number of jobs added were in education and health services , leisure and hospitality , and professional and business services . Declines were seen in the city 's manufacturing and government sectors .
Founded in 1670 as Charles Town in honor of King Charles II of England , Charleston adopted its present name in 1783 . It moved to its present location on Oyster Point in 1680 from a location on the west bank of the Ashley River known as Albemarle Point . By 1690 , Charles Town was the fifth-largest city in North America , and it remained among the 10 largest cities in the United States through the 1840 census . With a 2010 census population of 120,083 ( and a 2014 estimate of 130,113 ) , current trends put Charleston as the fastest-growing municipality in South Carolina . The population of the Charleston metropolitan area , comprising Berkeley , Charleston , and Dorchester Counties , was counted by the 2014 estimate at 727,689 – the third-largest in the state – and the 78th-largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States .
Several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibiotics . The issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the US Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance . This task force aims to actively address antimicrobial resistance , and is coordinated by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , and the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , as well as other US agencies . An NGO campaign group is Keep Antibiotics Working . In France , an " Antibiotics are not automatic " government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions , especially in children .
During his annual state-of-the-nation address on September 2 , 2014 , President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto unveiled plans for a new international airport to ease the city 's notorious air traffic congestion , tentatively slated for a 2018 opening . The new airport , which would have six runways , will cost $ 9.15 billion and would be built on vacant federal land east of Mexico City International Airport . Goals are to eventually handle 120 million passengers a year , which would make it the busiest airport in the world .
After the 1948 election , the state turned firmly Republican . Although registered Republicans were a minority in the state until 2015 , starting in 1952 , Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates in all but one election ( 1964 ) . This is not to say that every election has been a landslide for Republicans : Jimmy Carter lost the state by less than 1.5 % in 1976 , while Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton both won 40 % or more of the state 's popular vote in 1988 and 1996 respectively . Al Gore in 2000 , though , was the last Democrat to even win any counties in the state . Oklahoma was the only state where Barack Obama failed to carry any of its counties in both 2008 and 2012 .
Under the doctrine of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins ( 1938 ) , there is no general federal common law . Although federal courts can create federal common law in the form of case law , such law must be linked one way or another to the interpretation of a particular federal constitutional provision , statute , or regulation ( which in turn was enacted as part of the Constitution or after ) . Federal courts lack the plenary power possessed by state courts to simply make up law , which the latter are able to do in the absence of constitutional or statutory provisions replacing the common law . Only in a few narrow limited areas , like maritime law , has the Constitution expressly authorized the continuation of English common law at the federal level ( meaning that in those areas federal courts can continue to make law as they see fit , subject to the limitations of stare decisis ) .
The Holocaust ( which roughly means " burnt whole " ) was the deliberate and systematic murder of millions of Jews and other " unwanted " during World War II by the Nazi regime in Germany . Several differing views exist regarding whether it was intended to occur from the war 's beginning , or if the plans for it came about later . Regardless , persecution of Jews extended well before the war even started , such as in the Kristallnacht ( Night of Broken Glass ) . The Nazis used propaganda to great effect to stir up anti-Semitic feelings within ordinary Germans .
By the Victorian period in the 19th century historians were more inclined to draw on the judgements of the chroniclers and to focus on John 's moral personality . Kate Norgate , for example , argued that John 's downfall had been due not to his failure in war or strategy , but due to his " almost superhuman wickedness " , whilst James Ramsay blamed John 's family background and his cruel personality for his downfall . Historians in the " Whiggish " tradition , focusing on documents such as the Domesday Book and Magna Carta , trace a progressive and universalist course of political and economic development in England over the medieval period . These historians were often inclined to see John 's reign , and his signing of Magna Carta in particular , as a positive step in the constitutional development of England , despite the flaws of the king himself . Winston Churchill , for example , argued that " [ w ] hen the long tally is added , it will be seen that the British nation and the English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns " .
In 1657 , Oliver Cromwell granted the English East India Company a charter to govern Saint Helena and the following year the company decided to fortify the island and colonise it with planters . The first governor , Captain John Dutton , arrived in 1659 , making Saint Helena one of Britain 's oldest colonies outside North America and the Caribbean . A fort and houses were built . After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660 , the East India Company received a royal charter giving it the sole right to fortify and colonise the island . The fort was renamed James Fort and the town Jamestown , in honour of the Duke of York , later James II of England .
From January 18–20 , 2010 a national conference on Tibet and areas inhabited by Tibetans in Sichuan , Yunnan , Gansu and Qinghai was held in China and a substantial plan to improve development of the areas was announced . The conference was attended by General secretary Hu Jintao , Wu Bangguo , Wen Jiabao , Jia Qinglin , Li Changchun , Xi Jinping , Li Keqiang , He Guoqiang and Zhou Yongkang , all members of CPC Politburo Standing Committee signaling the commitment of senior Chinese leaders to development of Tibet and ethnic Tibetan areas . The plan calls for improvement of rural Tibetan income to national standards by 2020 and free education for all rural Tibetan children . China has invested 310 billion yuan ( about 45.6 billion U.S. dollars ) in Tibet since 2001 . " Tibet 's GDP was expected to reach 43.7 billion yuan in 2009 , up 170 percent from that in 2000 and posting an annual growth of 12.3 percent over the past nine years . "
Japanese seismologist Yuji Yagi at the University of Tsukuba said that the earthquake occurred in two stages : " The 155-mile Longmenshan Fault tore in two sections , the first one ripping about seven yards , followed by a second one that sheared four yards . " His data also showed that the earthquake lasted about two minutes and released 30 times the energy of the Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995 in Japan , which killed over 6,000 people . He pointed out that the shallowness of the epicenter and the density of population greatly increased the severity of the earthquake . Teruyuki Kato , a seismologist at the University of Tokyo , said that the seismic waves of the quake traveled a long distance without losing their power because of the firmness of the terrain in central China . According to reports from Chengdu , the capital of Sichuan province , the earthquake tremors lasted for " about two or three minutes " .
The Bengali Renaissance refers to a social reform movement during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the Bengal region of India during the period of British rule dominated by English educated Bengali Hindus . The Bengal Renaissance can be said to have started with Raja Ram Mohan Roy ( 1772–1833 ) and ended with Rabindranath Tagore ( 1861–1941 ) , although many stalwarts thereafter continued to embody particular aspects of the unique intellectual and creative output of the region . Nineteenth century Bengal was a unique blend of religious and social reformers , scholars , literary giants , journalists , patriotic orators , and scientists , all merging to form the image of a renaissance , and marked the transition from the 'medieval ' to the 'modern ' .
Over the course of Ottoman history , the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures , as well as original manuscripts . A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th Century . Sultan Mehmet II ordered Georgios Amiroutzes , a Greek scholar from Trabzon , to translate and make available to Ottoman educational institutions the geography book of Ptolemy . Another example is Ali Qushji -an astronomer , mathematician and physicist originally from Samarkand- who became a professor in two madrasas , and influenced Ottoman circles as a result of his writings and the activities of his students , even though he only spent two or three years before his death in Istanbul .
Throughout Europe at this time there was a rapid growth in trade and an associated growth in towns . Germany and the Lowlands had large flourishing towns that grew in comparative peace , in trade and competition with each other , or united for mutual weal , as in the Hanseatic League . Civic building was of great importance to these towns as a sign of wealth and pride . England and France remained largely feudal and produced grand domestic architecture for their kings , dukes and bishops , rather than grand town halls for their burghers .
Knots do not necessarily influence the stiffness of structural timber , this will depend on the size and location . Stiffness and elastic strength are more dependent upon the sound wood than upon localized defects . The breaking strength is very susceptible to defects . Sound knots do not weaken wood when subject to compression parallel to the grain .
With the emerging knowledge in scientific fields and the rise of new materials and technology , architecture and engineering began to separate , and the architect began to concentrate on aesthetics and the humanist aspects , often at the expense of technical aspects of building design . There was also the rise of the " gentleman architect " who usually dealt with wealthy clients and concentrated predominantly on visual qualities derived usually from historical prototypes , typified by the many country houses of Great Britain that were created in the Neo Gothic or Scottish Baronial styles . Formal architectural training in the 19th century , for example at École des Beaux-Arts in France , gave much emphasis to the production of beautiful drawings and little to context and feasibility . Effective architects generally received their training in the offices of other architects , graduating to the role from draughtsmen or clerks .
In the early and mid-2000s , the Bush administration called numerous times for investigation into the safety and soundness of the GSEs and their swelling portfolio of subprime mortgages . On September 10 , 2003 , the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing at the urging of the administration to assess safety and soundness issues and to review a recent report by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ( OFHEO ) that had uncovered accounting discrepancies within the two entities . The hearings never resulted in new legislation or formal investigation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , as many of the committee members refused to accept the report and instead rebuked OFHEO for their attempt at regulation . Some believe this was an early warning to the systemic risk that the growing market in subprime mortgages posed to the U.S. financial system that went unheeded .
Beyond this , BYU also runs a very large study abroad program , with satellite centers in London , Jerusalem , and Paris , as well as more than 20 other sites . Nearly 2,000 students take advantage of these programs yearly . In 2001 , the Institute of International Education ranked BYU as the number one university in the U.S. to offer students study abroad opportunities . The BYU Jerusalem Center , which was closed in 2000 due to student security concerns related to the Second Intifada and , more recently , the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict , was reopened to students in the Winter 2007 semester .
Besides increased efficiency of power plants , there was an increase in efficiency ( between 1950 and 1973 ) of the railway utilization of this electricity with energy-intensity dropping from 218 to 124 kwh/10,000 gross tonne-km ( of both passenger and freight trains ) or a 43 % drop . Since energy-intensity is the inverse of energy-efficiency it drops as efficiency goes up . But most of this 43 % decrease in energy-intensity also benefited diesel traction . The conversion of wheel bearings from plain to roller , increase of train weight , converting single track lines to double track ( or partially double track ) , and the elimination of obsolete 2-axle freight cars increased the energy-efficiency of all types of traction : electric , diesel , and steam . However , there remained a 12–15 % reduction of energy-intensity that only benefited electric traction ( and not diesel ) . This was due to improvements in locomotives , more widespread use of regenerative braking ( which in 1989 recycled 2.65 % of the electric energy used for traction , ) remote control of substations , better handling of the locomotive by the locomotive crew , and improvements in automation . Thus the overall efficiency of electric traction as compared to diesel more than doubled between 1950 and the mid-1970s in the Soviet Union . But after 1974 ( thru 1980 ) there was no improvement in energy-intensity ( wh/tonne-km ) in part due to increasing speeds of passenger and freight trains .
But while Claremont remains the most concentrated hub of Whiteheadian activity , the place where Whitehead 's thought currently seems to be growing the most quickly is in China . In order to address the challenges of modernization and industrialization , China has begun to blend traditions of Taoism , Buddhism , and Confucianism with Whitehead 's " constructive post-modern " philosophy in order to create an " ecological civilization . " To date , the Chinese government has encouraged the building of twenty-three university-based centers for the study of Whitehead 's philosophy , and books by process philosophers John Cobb and David Ray Griffin are becoming required reading for Chinese graduate students . Cobb has attributed China 's interest in process philosophy partly to Whitehead 's stress on the mutual interdependence of humanity and nature , as well as his emphasis on an educational system that includes the teaching of values rather than simply bare facts .
The first book printed in France , Epistolae ( " Letters " ) , by Gasparinus de Bergamo ( Gasparino da Barzizza ) , was published in Paris in 1470 by the press established by Johann Heynlin . Since then , Paris has been the centre of the French publishing industry , the home of some of the world 's best-known writers and poets , and the setting for many classic works of French literature . Almost all the books published in Paris in the Middle Ages were in Latin , rather than French . Paris did not become the acknowledged capital of French literature until the 17th century , with authors such as Boileau , Corneille , La Fontaine , Molière , Racine , several coming from the provinces , and the foundation of the Académie française . In the 18th century , the literary life of Paris revolved around the cafés and salons , and was dominated by Voltaire , Jean-Jacques Rousseau , Pierre de Marivaux , and Beaumarchais .
Scientific readers were already aware of arguments that species changed through processes that were subject to laws of nature , but the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague " law of development " of Vestiges had not found scientific favour . Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible . His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study , and by 1875 , most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant . Darwin 's scientific method was also disputed , with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill 's A System of Logic , while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell 's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences , in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design . Early support for Darwin 's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology , including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860 , and Asa Gray in 1862 . Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection . Alfred Russel Wallace discussed evidence from his Malay archipelago research , including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the Wallace line .
Based on the strength of his work , Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films . The first was a Richard Matheson adaptation called Duel . The film is about a psychotic Peterbilt 281 tanker truck driver who chases the terrified driver ( Dennis Weaver ) of a small Plymouth Valiant and tries to run him off the road . Special praise of this film by the influential British critic Dilys Powell was highly significant to Spielberg 's career . Another TV film ( Something Evil ) was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of The Exorcist , then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film . He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film-length pilot of a show called Savage , starring Martin Landau . Spielberg 's debut full-length feature film was The Sugarland Express , about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby . Spielberg 's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers , and The Hollywood Reporter stated that " a major new director is on the horizon . " :223 However , the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release .
Zhejiang consists mostly of hills , which account for about 70 % of its total area . Altitudes tend to be the highest to the south and west and the highest peak of the province , Huangmaojian Peak ( 1,929 meters or 6,329 feet ) , is located there . Other prominent mountains include Mounts Yandang , Tianmu , Tiantai , and Mogan , which reach altitudes of 700 to 1,500 meters ( 2,300 to 4,900 ft ) .
The Pala Empire ( Bengali : পাল সাম্রাজ্য Pal Samrajyô ) flourished during the Classical period of India , and may be dated during 750–1174 CE . Founded by Gopala I , it was ruled by a Buddhist dynasty from Bengal in the eastern region of the Indian subcontinent . Though the Palas were followers of the Mahayana and Tantric schools of Buddhism , they also patronised Shaivism and Vaishnavism . The morpheme Pala , meaning " protector " , was used as an ending for the names of all the Pala monarchs . The empire reached its peak under Dharmapala and Devapala . Dharmapala is believed to have conquered Kanauj and extended his sway up to the farthest limits of India in the northwest . The Pala Empire can be considered as the golden era of Bengal in many ways . Dharmapala founded the Vikramashila and revived Nalanda , considered one of the first great universities in recorded history . Nalanda reached its height under the patronage of the Pala Empire . The Palas also built many viharas . They maintained close cultural and commercial ties with countries of Southeast Asia and Tibet . Sea trade added greatly to the prosperity of the Pala kingdom . The Arab merchant Suleiman notes the enormity of the Pala army in his memoirs .
After Fidel Castro rose to power in Cuba in 1959 , many wealthy Cubans sought refuge in Miami , further increasing the population . The city developed businesses and cultural amenities as part of the New South . In the 1980s and 1990s , South Florida weathered social problems related to drug wars , immigration from Haiti and Latin America , and the widespread destruction of Hurricane Andrew . Racial and cultural tensions were sometimes sparked , but the city developed in the latter half of the 20th century as a major international , financial , and cultural center . It is the second-largest U.S. city ( after El Paso , Texas ) with a Spanish-speaking majority , and the largest city with a Cuban-American plurality .
The Baker v. Carr ( 1962 ) decision of the US Supreme Court established the principle of " one man , one vote " , requiring state legislatures to redistrict to bring Congressional apportionment in line with decennial censuses . It also required both houses of state legislatures to be based on population for representation and not geographic districts such as counties . This case arose out of a lawsuit challenging the longstanding rural bias of apportionment of seats in the Tennessee legislature . After decades in which urban populations had been underrepresented in many state legislatures , this significant ruling led to an increased ( and proportional ) prominence in state politics by urban and , eventually , suburban , legislators and statewide officeholders in relation to their population within the state . The ruling also applied to numerous other states long controlled by rural minorities , such as Alabama , Vermont , and Montana .
Having attended art college , Mercury also designed Queen 's logo , called the Queen crest , shortly before the release of the band 's first album . The logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members : two lions for Leo ( Deacon and Taylor ) , a crab for Cancer ( May ) , and two fairies for Virgo ( Mercury ) . The lions embrace a stylised letter Q , the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it , and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion . There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix . The whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom , particularly with the lion supporters . The original logo , as found on the reverse-side of the first album cover , was a simple line drawing but more intricate colour versions were used on later sleeves .
The Tuvalu Media Department of the Government of Tuvalu operates Radio Tuvalu which broadcasts from Funafuti . In 2011 the Japanese government provided financial support to construct a new AM broadcast studio . The installation of upgraded transmission equipment allows Radio Tuvalu to be heard on all nine islands of Tuvalu . The new AM radio transmitter on Funafuti replaced the FM radio service to the outer islands and freed up satellite bandwidth for mobile services . Fenui – news from Tuvalu is a free digital publication of the Tuvalu Media Department that is emailed to subscribers and operates a Facebook page , which publishes news about government activities and news about Tuvaluan events , such as a special edition covering the results of the 2015 general election .
In turn , according to Kozinski 's analysis , the contemporary rule of binding precedent became possible in the U.S. in the nineteenth century only after the creation of a clear court hierarchy ( under the Judiciary Acts ) , and the beginning of regular verbatim publication of U.S. appellate decisions by West Publishing . The rule gradually developed , case-by-case , as an extension of the judiciary 's public policy of effective judicial administration ( that is , in order to efficiently exercise the judicial power ) . The rule of precedent is generally justified today as a matter of public policy , first , as a matter of fundamental fairness , and second , because in the absence of case law , it would be completely unworkable for every minor issue in every legal case to be briefed , argued , and decided from first principles ( such as relevant statutes , constitutional provisions , and underlying public policies ) , which in turn would create hopeless inefficiency , instability , and unpredictability , and thereby undermine the rule of law .
Formerly , men not wearing military uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design . Women 's evening dress included obligatory trains and tiaras or feathers in their hair ( or both ) . The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed . After World War I , when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground , she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king 's reaction . King George V was horrified , so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low . Following their accession in 1936 , King George VI and his consort , Queen Elizabeth , allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise . Today , there is no official dress code . Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits ; a minority wear morning coats , and in the evening , depending on the formality of the occasion , black tie or white tie .
The TSFSR existed from 1922 to 1936 , when it was divided up into three separate entities ( Armenian SSR , Azerbaijan SSR , and Georgian SSR ) . Armenians enjoyed a period of relative stability under Soviet rule . They received medicine , food , and other provisions from Moscow , and communist rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire . The situation was difficult for the church , which struggled under Soviet rule . After the death of Vladimir Lenin , Joseph Stalin took the reins of power and began an era of renewed fear and terror for Armenians .
Around 1890 , a political movement developed in the United States to mandate private executions . Several states enacted laws which required executions to be conducted within a " wall " or " enclosure " to " exclude public view . " For example , in 1919 , the Missouri legislature adopted a statute ( L.1919 , p. 781 ) which required , " the sentence of death should be executed within the county jail , if convenient , and otherwise within an enclosure near the jail . " The Missouri law permitted the local sheriff to distribute passes to individuals ( usually local citizens ) whom he believed should witness the hanging , but the sheriffs – for various reasons – sometimes denied passes to individuals who wanted to watch . Missouri executions conducted after 1919 were not " public " because they were conducted behind closed walls , and the general public was not permitted to attend .
For air dielectric capacitors the breakdown field strength is of the order 2 to 5 MV/m ; for mica the breakdown is 100 to 300 MV/m ; for oil , 15 to 25 MV/m ; it can be much less when other materials are used for the dielectric . The dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited . Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV . As the voltage increases , the dielectric must be thicker , making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages . The breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts ; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown . Once this starts to happen , the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate , leaving carbon behind and causing a short ( or relatively low resistance ) circuit . The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy .
Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology , particularly with the stress systems . This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex , with an oxytocin-attachment system , which plays a major role in bonding . Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems ( Kurt Kortschal 2013 ) . These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission . Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells . Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells , and at every speciation event , heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring . In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split , only about 1.2 % of their genetic material has been modified . This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA , including our behaviors . Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes . In voles ( Microtus spp . ) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system ( Hammock & Young 2005 ) . Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOCP2 gene , which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language ( Vargha-Khadem et al . 2005 ) . Its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years , coinciding with the beginning of modern humans ( Enard et al . 2002 ) . Speech , language , and social organization are all part of the basis for emotions .
Red was the color of the banner of the Byzantine emperors . In Western Europe , Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority , and wore red shoes at his coronation . Kings , princes and , beginning in 1295 , Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red costumes . When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century , he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper . Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light . Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France , England and Germany . In Medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures ; both Christ and the Virgin Mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles .
Ann Arbor is a major scene of college sports , most notably at the University of Michigan , a member of the Big Ten Conference . Several well-known college sports facilities exist in the city , including Michigan Stadium , the largest American football stadium in the world . The stadium was completed in 1927 and cost more than $ 950,000 to build . It has a 109,901 seating capacity after multiple renovations were made . The stadium is colloquially known as " The Big House " . Crisler Center and Yost Ice Arena play host to the school 's basketball ( both men 's and women 's ) and ice hockey teams , respectively . Concordia University , a member of the NAIA , also fields sports teams .
For decades , the U.S. federal government strenuously tried to force Puerto Ricans to adopt English , to the extent of making them use English as the primary language of instruction in their high schools . It was completely unsuccessful , and retreated from that policy in 1948 . Puerto Rico was able to maintain its Spanish language , culture , and identity because the relatively small , densely populated island was already home to nearly a million people at the time of the U.S. takeover , all of those spoke Spanish , and the territory was never hit with a massive influx of millions of English speakers like the vast territory acquired from Mexico 50 years earlier .
In Eastern Europe , Byzantium revived its fortunes under Emperor Basil I ( r. 867–886 ) and his successors Leo VI ( r. 886–912 ) and Constantine VII ( r. 913–959 ) , members of the Macedonian dynasty . Commerce revived and the emperors oversaw the extension of a uniform administration to all the provinces . The military was reorganised , which allowed the emperors John I ( r. 969–976 ) and Basil II ( r. 976–1025 ) to expand the frontiers of the empire on all fronts . The imperial court was the centre of a revival of classical learning , a process known as the Macedonian Renaissance . Writers such as John Geometres ( fl . early 10th century ) composed new hymns , poems , and other works . Missionary efforts by both eastern and western clergy resulted in the conversion of the Moravians , Bulgars , Bohemians , Poles , Magyars , and Slavic inhabitants of the Kievan Rus ' . These conversions contributed to the founding of political states in the lands of those peoples—the states of Moravia , Bulgaria , Bohemia , Poland , Hungary , and the Kievan Rus ' . Bulgaria , which was founded around 680 , at its height reached from Budapest to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River in modern Ukraine to the Adriatic Sea . By 1018 , the last Bulgarian nobles had surrendered to the Byzantine Empire .
Apart from the passing of noble titles or ranks , inheritance practices did not involve primogeniture ; each son received an equal share of the family property . Unlike the practice in later dynasties , the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune . Daughters received a portion of the family fortune through their marriage dowries , though this was usually much less than the shares of sons . A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will , but it is unclear how common this was .
In 1952 , the United States elected a new president , and on 29 November 1952 , the president-elect , Dwight D. Eisenhower , went to Korea to learn what might end the Korean War . With the United Nations ' acceptance of India 's proposed Korean War armistice , the KPA , the PVA , and the UN Command ceased fire with the battle line approximately at the 38th parallel . Upon agreeing to the armistice , the belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) , which has since been patrolled by the KPA and ROKA , United States , and Joint UN Commands .
In 2013 and 2014 , a Russian/Ukrainian hacking ring known as " Rescator " broke into Target Corporation computers in 2013 , stealing roughly 40 million credit cards , and then Home Depot computers in 2014 , stealing between 53 and 56 million credit card numbers . Warnings were delivered at both corporations , but ignored ; physical security breaches using self checkout machines are believed to have played a large role . " The malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting , " says Jim Walter , director of threat intelligence operations at security technology company McAfee – meaning that the heists could have easily been stopped by existing antivirus software had administrators responded to the warnings . The size of the thefts has resulted in major attention from state and Federal United States authorities and the investigation is ongoing .
Vinyl records do not break easily , but the soft material is easily scratched . Vinyl readily acquires a static charge , attracting dust that is difficult to remove completely . Dust and scratches cause audio clicks and pops . In extreme cases , they can cause the needle to skip over a series of grooves , or worse yet , cause the needle to skip backwards , creating a " locked groove " that repeats over and over . This is the origin of the phrase " like a broken record " or " like a scratched record " , which is often used to describe a person or thing that continually repeats itself . Locked grooves are not uncommon and were even heard occasionally in radio broadcasts .
Some devices , such as high-speed external disk drives , require more than 500 mA of current and therefore may have power issues if powered from just one USB 2.0 port : erratic function , failure to function , or overloading/damaging the port . Such devices may come with an external power source or a Y-shaped cable that has two USB connectors ( one for power and data , the other for power only ) to plug into a computer . With such a cable , a device can draw power from two USB ports simultaneously . However , USB compliance specification states that " use of a 'Y ' cable ( a cable with two A-plugs ) is prohibited on any USB peripheral " , meaning that " if a USB peripheral requires more power than allowed by the USB specification to which it is designed , then it must be self-powered . "
John was incensed about what he perceived as an abrogation of his customary right as monarch to influence the election . He complained both about the choice of Langton as an individual , as John felt he was overly influenced by the Capetian court in Paris , and about the process as a whole . He barred Langton from entering England and seized the lands of the archbishopric and other papal possessions . Innocent set a commission in place to try to convince John to change his mind , but to no avail . Innocent then placed an interdict on England in March 1208 , prohibiting clergy from conducting religious services , with the exception of baptisms for the young , and confessions and absolutions for the dying .
According to the scriptures , Gautama Buddha presented himself as a model . The Dharma offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of Nirvana . The Sangha is considered to provide a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha 's teachings is attainable .
One-third of the world 's population is thought to be infected with TB . New infections occur in about 1 % of the population each year . In 2014 , there were 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.5 million deaths . More than 95 % of deaths occurred in developing countries . The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000 . About 80 % of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 5–10 % of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test . Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times .
Carnival is known as Crop Over and is Barbados 's biggest festival . Its early beginnings were on the sugar cane plantations during the colonial period . Crop over began in 1688 , and featured singing , dancing and accompaniment by shak-shak , banjo , triangle , fiddle , guitar , bottles filled with water and bones . Other traditions included climbing a greased pole , feasting and drinking competitions . Originally signaling the end of the yearly cane harvest , it evolved into a national festival . In the late 20th century , Crop Over began to closely mirror the Trinidad Carnival . Beginning in June , Crop Over runs until the first Monday in August when it culminates in the finale , The Grand Kadooment .

On November 18 , 1990 , the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church enthroned Mstyslav as Patriarch of Kiev and all Ukraine during ceremonies at Saint Sophia 's Cathedral . Also on November 18 , Canada announced that its consul-general to Kiev would be Ukrainian-Canadian Nestor Gayowsky . On November 19 , the United States announced that its consul to Kiev would be Ukrainian-American John Stepanchuk . On November 19 , the chairmen of the Ukrainian and Russian parliaments , respectively , Kravchuk and Yeltsin , signed a 10-year bilateral pact . In early December 1990 the Party of Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine was founded ; on December 15 , the Democratic Party of Ukraine was founded .
The Wagner tuba , a modified member of the horn family , appears in Richard Wagner 's cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen and several other works by Strauss , Béla Bartók , and others ; it has a prominent role in Anton Bruckner 's Symphony No . 7 in E Major . Cornets appear in Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky 's ballet Swan Lake , Claude Debussy 's La Mer , and several orchestral works by Hector Berlioz . Unless these instruments are played by members doubling on another instrument ( for example , a trombone player changing to euphonium for a certain passage ) , orchestras will use freelance musicians to augment their regular rosters .
Buddhism /ˈbudɪzəm/ is a nontheistic religion [ note 1 ] or philosophy ( Sanskrit : धर्म dharma ; Pali : धम्म dhamma ) that encompasses a variety of traditions , beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on teachings attributed to Gautama Buddha , commonly known as the Buddha ( " the awakened one " ) . According to Buddhist tradition , the Buddha lived and taught in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent , present-day Nepal sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE . [ note 1 ] He is recognized by Buddhists as an awakened or enlightened teacher who shared his insights to help sentient beings end their suffering through the elimination of ignorance and craving . Buddhists believe that this is accomplished through the direct understanding and perception of dependent origination and the Four Noble Truths .
The Platyzoa include the phylum Platyhelminthes , the flatworms . These were originally considered some of the most primitive Bilateria , but it now appears they developed from more complex ancestors . A number of parasites are included in this group , such as the flukes and tapeworms . Flatworms are acoelomates , lacking a body cavity , as are their closest relatives , the microscopic Gastrotricha . The other platyzoan phyla are mostly microscopic and pseudocoelomate . The most prominent are the Rotifera or rotifers , which are common in aqueous environments . They also include the Acanthocephala or spiny-headed worms , the Gnathostomulida , Micrognathozoa , and possibly the Cycliophora . These groups share the presence of complex jaws , from which they are called the Gnathifera .
The Bohr magneton and the nuclear magneton are units which are used to describe the magnetic properties of the electron and atomic nuclei respectively . The Bohr magneton is the magnetic moment which would be expected for an electron if it behaved as a spinning charge according to classical electrodynamics . It is defined in terms of the reduced Planck constant , the elementary charge and the electron mass , all of which depend on the Planck constant : the final dependence on h1/2 ( r2 > 0.995 ) can be found by expanding the variables .
The term " Moors " has been used in Europe in a broader , somewhat derogatory sense to refer to Muslims , especially those of Arab or Berber descent , whether living in North Africa or Iberia . Moors were not a distinct or self-defined people . Medieval and early modern Europeans applied the name to Muslim Arabs , Berbers , Black Africans and Europeans alike .
Roman religious beliefs date back to the founding of Rome , around 800 BC . However , the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC , when Romans came in contact with Greek culture , and adopted many of the Greek religious beliefs . Private and personal worship was an important aspect of religious practices . In a sense , each household was a temple to the gods . Each household had an altar ( lararium ) , at which the family members would offer prayers , perform rites , and interact with the household gods . Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon , others were based on Greek gods . The two most famous deities were Jupiter ( the king God ) and Mars ( the god of war ) . With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean , Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture , as well as other philosophical traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism .
The Roman Republic ( Latin : Res publica Romana ; Classical Latin : [ ˈreːs ˈpuːb.lɪ.ka roːˈmaː.na ] ) was the period of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom , traditionally dated to 509 BC , and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire . It was during this period that Rome 's control expanded from the city 's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world . During the first two centuries of its existence , the Roman Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance , from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula . By the following century , it included North Africa , Spain , and what is now southern France . Two centuries after that , towards the end of the 1st century BC , it included the rest of modern France , Greece , and much of the eastern Mediterranean . By this time , internal tensions led to a series of civil wars , culminating with the assassination of Julius Caesar , which led to the transition from republic to empire . The exact date of transition can be a matter of interpretation . Historians have variously proposed Julius Caesar 's crossing of the Rubicon River in 49 BC , Caesar 's appointment as dictator for life in 44 BC , and the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . However , most use the same date as did the ancient Romans themselves , the Roman Senate 's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian and his adopting the title Augustus in 27 BC , as the defining event ending the Republic .
Working closely in conjunction with the definition of the Near East provided by the State Department is the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies ( NESA ) , an educational institution of the United States Department of Defense . It teaches courses and holds seminars and workshops for government officials and military officers who will work or are working within its region . As the name indicates , that region is a combination of State Department regions ; however , NESA is careful to identify the State Department region . As its Near East is not different from the State Department 's it does not appear in the table . Its name , however , is not entirely accurate . For example , its region includes Mauritania , a member of the State Department 's Africa ( Sub-Sahara ) .
Pubs may be venues for pub songs and live music . During the 1970s pubs provided an outlet for a number of bands , such as Kilburn and the High Roads , Dr. Feelgood and The Kursaal Flyers , who formed a musical genre called Pub rock that was a precursor to Punk music .
He moved rapidly . First , he promoted Confucian orthodoxy and reversed what he saw as his father 's laxness by cracking down on unorthodox sects and by decapitating an anti-Manchu writer his father had pardoned . In 1723 he outlawed Christianity and expelled Christian missionaries , though some were allowed to remain in the capital . Next , he moved to control the government . He expanded his father 's system of Palace Memorials which brought frank and detailed reports on local conditions directly to the throne without being intercepted by the bureaucracy , and created a small Grand Council of personal advisors which eventually grew into the emperor 's de facto cabinet for the rest of the dynasty . He shrewdly filled key positions with Manchu and Han Chinese officials who depended on his patronage . When he began to realize that the financial crisis was even greater than he had thought , Yongzheng rejected his father 's lenient approach to local landowning elites and mounted a campaign to enforce collection of the land tax . The increased revenues were to be used for " money to nourish honesty " among local officials and for local irrigation , schools , roads , and charity . Although these reforms were effective in the north , in the south and lower Yangzi valley , where Kangxi had wooed the elites , there were long established networks of officials and landowners . Yongzheng dispatched experienced Manchu commissioners to penetrate the thickets of falsified land registers and coded account books , but they were met with tricks , passivity , and even violence . The fiscal crisis persisted .
In Greece Carnival is also known as the Apokriés ( Greek : Αποκριές , " saying goodbye to meat " ) , or the season of the " Opening of the Triodion " , so named after the liturgical book used by the church from then until Holy Week . One of the season 's high points is Tsiknopempti , when celebrants enjoy roast beef dinners ; the ritual is repeated the following Sunday . The following week , the last before Lent , is called Tyrinē ( Greek : Τυρινή , " cheese [ week ] " ) because meat is forbidden , although dairy products are not . Lent begins on " Clean Monday " , the day after " Cheese Sunday " . Throughout the Carnival season , people disguise themselves as maskarádes ( " masqueraders " ) and engage in pranks and revelry .
Traditionally , Switzerland avoids alliances that might entail military , political , or direct economic action and has been neutral since the end of its expansion in 1515 . Its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 . Only in 2002 did Switzerland become a full member of the United Nations and it was the first state to join it by referendum . Switzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and historically has served as an intermediary between other states . Switzerland is not a member of the European Union ; the Swiss people have consistently rejected membership since the early 1990s . However , Switzerland does participate in the Schengen Area .
In the city , 24.6 % of the population were under the age of 18 , 10.2 % from 18 to 24 , 26.8 % from 25 to 44 , 25.8 % from 45 to 64 , and 12.7 % who were 65 years of age or older . The median age was 36.3 years . For every 100 females there were 96.2 males . For every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 94.4 males .
The River Plym , which flows off Dartmoor to the north-east , forms a smaller estuary to the east of the city called Cattewater . Plymouth Sound is protected from the sea by the Plymouth Breakwater , in use since 1814 . In the Sound is Drake 's Island which is seen from Plymouth Hoe , a flat public area on top of limestone cliffs . The Unitary Authority of Plymouth is 79.84 square kilometres ( 30.83 sq mi ) . The topography rises from sea level to a height , at Roborough , of about 509 feet ( 155 m ) above Ordnance Datum ( AOD ) .
The Library of Congress ( LoC ) is an institution established by Congress to provide a research library for the government of the United States and serve as a national library . It is under the supervision of the United States Congress Joint Committee on the Library and the Librarian of Congress . The Near East is a separate topic and subdivision of the African and Middle Eastern division . The Middle East contains a Hebraic section consisting of only Israel for a country , but including eleven modern and ancient languages relating to Judaism , such as Yiddish , a European pidgin language . The Near East is otherwise nearly identical to the Middle East , except that it extends partly into Central Asia and the Caucasus , regions that the State Department considers to be in Asia .
Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist . Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains . For example , an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome . Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA . Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to , and may have been transferred to , antibacterial-resistant strains . The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange . For instance , antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes . Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials . Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound .
Notably , a statute does not disappear automatically merely because it has been found unconstitutional ; it must be deleted by a subsequent statute . Many federal and state statutes have remained on the books for decades after they were ruled to be unconstitutional . However , under the principle of stare decisis , no sensible lower court will enforce an unconstitutional statute , and any court that does so will be reversed by the Supreme Court . Conversely , any court that refuses to enforce a constitutional statute ( where such constitutionality has been expressly established in prior cases ) will risk reversal by the Supreme Court .
In 1978 , Hayek came into conflict with the Liberal Party leader , David Steel , who claimed that liberty was possible only with " social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth and power , which in turn require a degree of active government intervention " and that the Conservative Party were more concerned with the connection between liberty and private enterprise than between liberty and democracy . Hayek claimed that a limited democracy might be better than other forms of limited government at protecting liberty but that an unlimited democracy was worse than other forms of unlimited government because " its government loses the power even to do what it thinks right if any group on which its majority depends thinks otherwise " .
In China , urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex . Large urban centers , such as Nanjing and Beijing , also contributed to the growth of private industry . In particular , small-scale industries grew up , often specializing in paper , silk , cotton , and porcelain goods . For the most part , however , relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country . Town markets mainly traded food , with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil . Despite the xenophobia and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of neo-Confucianism , China under the early Ming dynasty was not isolated . Foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world , particularly Japan , increased considerably . Chinese merchants explored all of the Indian Ocean , reaching East Africa with the treasure voyages of Zheng He .
In Greek mythology , Cerberus is a three-headed watchdog who guards the gates of Hades . In Norse mythology , a bloody , four-eyed dog called Garmr guards Helheim . In Persian mythology , two four-eyed dogs guard the Chinvat Bridge . In Philippine mythology , Kimat who is the pet of Tadaklan , god of thunder , is responsible for lightning . In Welsh mythology , Annwn is guarded by Cŵn Annwn .
Pesticide use raises a number of environmental concerns . Over 98 % of sprayed insecticides and 95 % of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species , including non-target species , air , water and soil . Pesticide drift occurs when pesticides suspended in the air as particles are carried by wind to other areas , potentially contaminating them . Pesticides are one of the causes of water pollution , and some pesticides are persistent organic pollutants and contribute to soil contamination .
On 28 January 2012 , police arrested four current and former staff members of The Sun , as part of a probe in which journalists paid police officers for information ; a police officer was also arrested in the probe . The Sun staffers arrested were crime editor Mike Sullivan , head of news Chris Pharo , former deputy editor Fergus Shanahan , and former managing editor Graham Dudman , who since became a columnist and media writer . All five arrested were held on suspicion of corruption . Police also searched the offices of News International , the publishers of The Sun , as part of a continuing investigation into the News of the World scandal .
The events of the Franco-Prussian War had great influence on military thinking over the next forty years . Lessons drawn from the war included the need for a general staff system , the scale and duration of future wars and the tactical use of artillery and cavalry . The bold use of artillery by the Prussians , to silence French guns at long range and then to directly support infantry attacks at close range , proved to be superior to the defensive doctrine employed by French gunners . The Prussian tactics were adopted by European armies by 1914 , exemplified in the French 75 , an artillery piece optimised to provide direct fire support to advancing infantry . Most European armies ignored the evidence of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 which suggested that infantry armed with new smokeless-powder rifles could engage gun crews effectively . This forced gunners to fire at longer range using indirect fire , usually from a position of cover .
Directly underneath the State Apartments is a suite of slightly less grand rooms known as the semi-state apartments . Opening from the Marble Hall , these rooms are used for less formal entertaining , such as luncheon parties and private audiences . Some of the rooms are named and decorated for particular visitors , such as the 1844 Room , decorated in that year for the State visit of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia , and , on the other side of the Bow Room , the 1855 Room , in honour of the visit of Emperor Napoleon III of France . At the centre of this suite is the Bow Room , through which thousands of guests pass annually to the Queen 's Garden Parties in the Gardens . The Queen and Prince Philip use a smaller suite of rooms in the north wing .
People have used wood for millennia for many purposes , primarily as a fuel or as a construction material for making houses , tools , weapons , furniture , packaging , artworks , and paper . The year-to-year variation in tree-ring widths and isotopic abundances gives clues to the prevailing climate at that time .
Within Buddhism , samsara is defined as the continual repetitive cycle of birth and death that arises from ordinary beings ' grasping and fixating on a self and experiences . Specifically , samsara refers to the process of cycling through one rebirth after another within the six realms of existence , [ note 2 ] where each realm can be understood as physical realm or a psychological state characterized by a particular type of suffering . Samsara arises out of avidya ( ignorance ) and is characterized by dukkha ( suffering , anxiety , dissatisfaction ) . In the Buddhist view , liberation from samsara is possible by following the Buddhist path .
Buddhism /ˈbudɪzəm/ is a nontheistic religion [ note 1 ] or philosophy ( Sanskrit : धर्म dharma ; Pali : धम्म dhamma ) that encompasses a variety of traditions , beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on teachings attributed to Gautama Buddha , commonly known as the Buddha ( " the awakened one " ) . According to Buddhist tradition , the Buddha lived and taught in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent , present-day Nepal sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE . [ note 1 ] He is recognized by Buddhists as an awakened or enlightened teacher who shared his insights to help sentient beings end their suffering through the elimination of ignorance and craving . Buddhists believe that this is accomplished through the direct understanding and perception of dependent origination and the Four Noble Truths .
The USB standard specifies relatively loose tolerances for compliant USB connectors to minimize physical incompatibilities in connectors from different vendors . To address a weakness present in some other connector standards , the USB specification also defines limits to the size of a connecting device in the area around its plug . This was done to prevent a device from blocking adjacent ports due to the size of the cable strain relief mechanism ( usually molding integral with the cable outer insulation ) at the connector . Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable that does .
The Sardinian language is considered to be its own Romance language family , separate not only from standard Italian but also the wider Italo-Dalmatian family , and it includes the Campidanese Sardinian and Logudorese Sardinian variants . However , Gallurese , Sassarese , and Corsican are also spoken in Sardinia , and these languages are considered closely related or derived from the Italian Tuscan language and thus are Italo-Dalmatian languages . Furthermore , the Gallo-Romance language of Ligurian and the Catalan Algherese dialect are also spoken in Sardinia .
Traditionally , subspecies are seen as geographically isolated and genetically differentiated populations . That is , " the designation 'subspecies ' is used to indicate an objective degree of microevolutionary divergence " One objection to this idea is that it does not specify what degree of differentiation is required . Therefore , any population that is somewhat biologically different could be considered a subspecies , even to the level of a local population . As a result , Templeton has argued that it is necessary to impose a threshold on the level of difference that is required for a population to be designated a subspecies .
Macao : The event was held in Macau on May 3 . It was the first time that the Olympic torch had traveled to Macau . A ceremony was held at Macau Fisherman 's Wharf . Afterward , the torch traveled through Macau , passing by a number of landmarks including A-Ma Temple , Macau Tower , Ponte Governador Nobre de Carvalho , Ponte de Sai Van , Macau Cultural Centre , Macau Stadium and then back to the Fisherman 's Wharf for the closing ceremony . Parts of the route near Ruins of St. Paul 's and Taipa was shortened due to large crowds of supporters blocking narrow streets . A total of 120 torchbearers participated in this event including casino tycoon Stanley Ho . Leong Hong Man and Leong Heng Teng were the first and last torchbearer in the relay respectively . An article published on Macao Daily News criticized that the list of the torchbearers could not fully represent the Macanese and that there were too many non-athletes among the torchbearers . ( some of whom had already been torchbearers of other sporting events )
There are a multitude of supporters as well as opponents to the policy of affirmative action . Many presidents throughout the last century have failed to take a very firm stance on the policy , and the public has had to discern the president 's opinion for themselves . Bill Clinton , however , made his stance on affirmative action very clear in a speech on July 19 , 1995 , nearly two and a half years after his inauguration . In his speech , he discussed the history in the United States that brought the policy into fruition : slavery , Jim Crow , and segregation . Clinton also mentioned a point similar to President Lyndon B. Johnson 's " Freedom is not Enough " speech , and declared that just outlawing discrimination in the country would not be enough to give everyone in America equality . He addressed the arguments that affirmative action hurt the white middle class and said that the policy was not the source of their problems . Clinton plainly outlined his stance on affirmative action , saying :
Resonant antennas are expected to be used around a particular resonant frequency ; an antenna must therefore be built or ordered to match the frequency range of the intended application . A particular antenna design will present a particular feedpoint impedance . While this may affect the choice of an antenna , an antenna 's impedance can also be adapted to the desired impedance level of a system using a matching network while maintaining the other characteristics ( except for a possible loss of efficiency ) .
At least where the digital audio tracks were concerned , the sound quality was unsurpassed at the time compared to consumer videotape , but the quality of the analog soundtracks varied greatly depending on the disc and , sometimes , the player . Many early and lower-end LD players had poor analog audio components , and many early discs had poorly mastered analog audio tracks , making digital soundtracks in any form most desirable to serious enthusiasts . Early DiscoVision and LaserDisc titles lacked the digital audio option , but many of those movies received digital sound in later re-issues by Universal , and the quality of analog audio tracks generally got far better as time went on . Many discs that had originally carried old analog stereo tracks received new Dolby Stereo and Dolby Surround tracks instead , often in addition to digital tracks , helping boost sound quality . Later analog discs also applied CX Noise Reduction , which improved the signal-noise ratio of their audio .
Worldwide use of solar power and wind power continued to grow significantly in 2012 . Solar electricity consumption increased by 58 percent , to 93 terawatt-hours ( TWh ) . Use of wind power in 2012 increased by 18.1 percent , to 521.3 TWh . Global solar and wind energy installed capacities continued to expand even though new investments in these technologies declined during 2012 . Worldwide investment in solar power in 2012 was $ 140.4 billion , an 11 percent decline from 2011 , and wind power investment was down 10.1 percent , to $ 80.3 billion . But due to lower production costs for both technologies , total installed capacities grew sharply . This investment decline , but growth in installed capacity , may again occur in 2013 . Analysts expect the market to triple by 2030 . In 2015 , investment in renewables exceeded fossils .
Selenizza is mainly used as an additive in the road construction sector . It is mixed with traditional bitumen to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing . It may be blended with the hot bitumen in tanks , but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants . Other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks , bridges , car-parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for the oil and gas industry . Selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in big bags or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags .
Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation . Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet . Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier . Its largest moon , Triton , was discovered shortly thereafter , though none of the planet 's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century . The planet 's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size , making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes . Neptune was visited by Voyager 2 , when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989 . The advent of Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar .
The term middle east as a noun and adjective was common in the 19th century in nearly every context except diplomacy and archaeology . An uncountable number of places appear to have had their middle easts from gardens to regions , including the United States . The innovation of the term " Near East " to mean the holdings of the Ottoman Empire as early as the Crimean War had left a geographical gap . The East Indies , or " Far East , " derived ultimately from Ptolemy 's " India Beyond the Ganges . " The Ottoman Empire ended at the eastern border of Iraq . " India This Side of the Ganges " and Iran had been omitted . The archaeologists counted Iran as " the Near East " because Old Persian cuneiform had been found there . This usage did not sit well with the diplomats ; India was left in an equivocal state . They needed a regional term .
Tucson 's primary electrical power source is a coal and natural gas power-plant managed by Tucson Electric Power that is situated within the city limits on the south-western boundary of Davis-Monthan Air-force base adjacent to Interstate-10 . The air pollution generated has raised some concerns as the Sundt operating station has been online since 1962 as is exempt from many pollution standards and controls due to its age . Solar has been gaining ground in Tucson with its ideal over 300 days of sunshine climate . Federal , state , and even local utility credits and incentives have also enticed residents to equip homes with solar systems . Davis-Monthan AFB has a 3.3 Megawatt ( MW ) ground-mounted solar photovoltaic ( PV ) array and a 2.7 MW rooftop-mounted PV array , both of which are located in the Base Housing area . The base will soon have the largest solar-generating capacity in the United States Department of Defense after awarding a contract on September 10 , 2010 , to SunEdison to construct a 14.5 MW PV field on the northwestern side of the base .
Apollo as a handsome beardless young man , is often depicted with a kithara ( as Apollo Citharoedus ) or bow in his hand , or reclining on a tree ( the Apollo Lykeios and Apollo Sauroctonos types ) . The Apollo Belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century ; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of Classical Antiquity for Europeans , from the Renaissance through the 19th century . The marble is a Hellenistic or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor Leochares , made between 350 and 325 BCE .
Compared to other team sports , the National Football League preseason is very structured . Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year , two at home and two away , with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game , the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game . These exhibition games , most of which are held in the month of August , are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players . While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season , there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents ; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games . Split-squad games , a practice common in baseball and hockey , where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads , are prohibited . The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe , Japan , Canada , Australia ( including the American Bowl in 1999 ) and Mexico to spread the league 's popularity ( a game of this type was proposed for China but , due to financial and logistical problems , was eventually canceled ) . The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents , with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a team other than an NFL team ( the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars ) was held in 1976 . Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans , who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package . Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice , but none have been successful in halting it . [ citation needed ] The Pro Bowl , traditionally played after the end of the NFL season ( since 2011 is played the week prior to the Super Bowl ) , is also considered an exhibition game .
Muslim sects regarded as heretical , such as the Druze , Ismailis , Alevis , and Alawites , ranked below Jews and Christians . In 1514 , Sultan Selim I , nicknamed " the Grim " because of his cruelty , ordered the massacre of 40,000 Anatolian Alevis ( Qizilbash ) , whom he considered heretics , reportedly proclaiming that " the killing of one Alevi had as much otherworldly reward as killing 70 Christians . " [ page needed ] Selim was also responsible for an unprecedented and rapid expansion of the Ottoman Empire into the Middle East , especially through his conquest of the entire Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt , which included much of the region . With these conquests , Selim further solidified the Ottoman claim for being an Islamic caliphate , although Ottoman sultans had been claiming the title of caliph since the 14th century starting with Murad I ( reigned 1362 to 1389 ) . The caliphate would remain held by Ottoman sultans for the rest of the office 's duration , which ended with its abolition on 3 March 1924 by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and the exile of the last caliph , Abdülmecid II , to France .
IndyMac reported that during April 2008 , Moody 's and Standard & Poor 's downgraded the ratings on a significant number of Mortgage-backed security ( MBS ) bonds including $ 160 million of those issued by IndyMac and which the bank retained in its MBS portfolio . IndyMac concluded that these downgrades would have negatively impacted the Company 's risk-based capital ratio as of June 30 , 2008 . Had these lowered ratings been in effect at March 31 , 2008 , IndyMac concluded that the bank 's capital ratio would have been 9.27 % total risk-based . IndyMac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below " well capitalized " ( minimum 10 % risk-based capital ratio ) to " adequately capitalized " ( 8–10 % risk-based capital ratio ) the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds .
Feeding structures in the mouth region vary widely , and have little correlation with the animals ' diets . Many polychaetes have a muscular pharynx that can be everted ( turned inside out to extend it ) . In these animals the foremost few segments often lack septa so that , when the muscles in these segments contract , the sharp increase in fluid pressure from all these segments everts the pharynx very quickly . Two families , the Eunicidae and Phyllodocidae , have evolved jaws , which can be used for seizing prey , biting off pieces of vegetation , or grasping dead and decaying matter . On the other hand , some predatory polychaetes have neither jaws nor eversible pharynges . Selective deposit feeders generally live in tubes on the sea-floor and use palps to find food particles in the sediment and then wipe them into their mouths . Filter feeders use " crowns " of palps covered in cilia that wash food particles towards their mouths . Non-selective deposit feeders ingest soil or marine sediments via mouths that are generally unspecialized . Some clitellates have sticky pads in the roofs of their mouths , and some of these can evert the pads to capture prey . Leeches often have an eversible proboscis , or a muscular pharynx with two or three teeth .
Southampton used to be home to a number of ferry services to the continent , with destinations such as San Sebastian , Lisbon , Tangier and Casablanca . A ferry port was built during the 1960s . However , a number of these relocated to Portsmouth and by 1996 , there were no longer any car ferries operating from Southampton with the exception of services to the Isle of Wight . The land used for Southampton Ferry Port was sold off and a retail and housing development was built on the site . The Princess Alexandra Dock was converted into a marina . Reception areas for new cars now fill the Eastern Docks where passengers , dry docks and trains used to be .
During the later stages of World War II , the entire Cold War , and to a lesser extent afterwards , uranium-235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons . Initially , two major types of fission bombs were built : a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238 . Later , a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb ( thermonuclear weapon ) was built , that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion . Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile ( unenriched ) uranium case , and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process .
Initially sensors were optical and acoustic devices developed during the First World War and continued into the 1930s , but were quickly superseded by radar , which in turn was supplemented by optronics in the 1980s . Command and control remained primitive until the late 1930s , when Britain created an integrated system for ADGB that linked the ground-based air defence of the army 's AA Command , although field-deployed air defence relied on less sophisticated arrangements . NATO later called these arrangements an " air defence ground environment " , defined as " the network of ground radar sites and command and control centres within a specific theatre of operations which are used for the tactical control of air defence operations " .
In 2005 , in order to host The 10th National Game of People 's Republic of China , there was a new stadium , Nanjing Olympic Sports Center , constructed in Nanjing . Compared to Wutaishan Sports Center , which the major stadium 's capacity is 18,500 , Nanjing Olympic Sports Center has a more advanced stadium which is big enough to seat 60,000 spectators . Its gymnasium has capacity of 13,000 , and natatorium of capacity 3,000 .
After back-to-back pennants in 1880 and 1881 , Hulbert died , and Spalding , who had retired to start Spalding sporting goods , assumed ownership of the club . The White Stockings , with Anson acting as player/manager , captured their third consecutive pennant in 1882 , and Anson established himself as the game 's first true superstar . In 1885 and '86 , after winning N.L . pennants , the White Stockings met the short-lived American Association champion in that era 's version of a World Series . Both seasons resulted in match ups with the St. Louis Brown Stockings , with the clubs tying in 1885 and with St. Louis winning in 1886 . This was the genesis of what would eventually become one of the greatest rivalries in sports . In all , the Anson-led Chicago Base Ball Club won six National League pennants between 1876 and 1886 . As a result , Chicago 's club nickname transitioned , and by 1890 they had become known as the Chicago Colts , or sometimes " Anson 's Colts " , referring to Cap 's influence within the club . Anson was the first player in history credited with collecting 3,000 career hits . After a disappointing record of 59-73 and a 9th-place finish in 1897 , Anson was released by the Cubs as both a player and manager . Due to Anson 's absence from the club after 22 years , local newspaper reporters started to refer to the Cubs as the " Orphans " .
Adults have a meringue battle at midnight at the historic Plaça de les Cols . In the mysterious sortida del Moixo Foguer ( the outing of Little-Bird-Bonfire ) accompanied by the Xerraire ( jabberer ) who insults the crowd . In the King 's precession he and his concubines scandalize the town with their sexual behavior . A correfoc ( fire run ) or Devil 's dance ( Ball de diables , features dancing youth amid the sparks and explosions of the ritual crew of devils . Other items includes bed races in the streets , the debauched Nit dels Mascarots , Karaoke sausage roasts , xatonades , the children 's party , Vidalet , the last night of revelry , Vidalot , the talking-dance of the Mismatched Couples ( Ball de Malcasats ) and the children 's King Caramel whose massive belly , long nose and sausage-like hair hint at his insatiable appetites .
The Liberal Party 's organisation is dominated by the six state divisions , reflecting the party 's original commitment to a federalised system of government ( a commitment which was strongly maintained by all Liberal governments until 1983 , but was to a large extent abandoned by the Howard Government , which showed strong centralising tendencies ) . Menzies deliberately created a weak national party machine and strong state divisions . Party policy is made almost entirely by the parliamentary parties , not by the party 's rank-and-file members , although Liberal party members do have a degree of influence over party policy .
Albertus Magnus championed the idea , drawn from Dionysus , that positive knowledge of God is possible , but obscure . Thus , it is easier to state what God is not , than to state what God is : " ... we affirm things of God only relatively , that is , casually , whereas we deny things of God absolutely , that is , with reference to what He is in Himself . And there is no contradiction between a relative affirmation and an absolute negation . It is not contradictory to say that someone is white-toothed and not white " .
The city also has the Southampton Sports Centre which is the focal point for the public 's sporting and outdoor activities and includes an Alpine Centre , theme park and athletics centre which is used by professional athletes . With the addition of 11 other additional leisure venures which are currently operate by the Council leisure executives . However these have been sold the operating rights to " Park Wood Leisure . "
On March 1 , 2010 ( UTC ) , many of the original " fat " PlayStation 3 models worldwide were experiencing errors related to their internal system clock . The error had many symptoms . Initially , the main problem seemed to be the inability to connect to the PlayStation Network . However , the root cause of the problem was unrelated to the PlayStation Network , since even users who had never been online also had problems playing installed offline games ( which queried the system timer as part of startup ) and using system themes . At the same time many users noted that the console 's clock had gone back to December 31 , 1999 . The event was nicknamed the ApocalyPS3 , a play on the word apocalypse and PS3 , the abbreviation for the PlayStation 3 console .
Ottoman classical music was an important part of the education of the Ottoman elite , a number of the Ottoman sultans were accomplished musicians and composers themselves , such as Selim III , whose compositions are often still performed today . Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of Byzantine music , Armenian music , Arabic music , and Persian music . Compositionally , it is organised around rhythmic units called usul , which are somewhat similar to meter in Western music , and melodic units called makam , which bear some resemblance to Western musical modes .
In the shrinking PC industry , Dell continued to lose market share , as it dropped below Lenovo in 2011 to fall to number three in the world . Dell and fellow American contemporary Hewlett Packard came under pressure from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo , Asus , and Acer , all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins . In addition , while the Asian PC vendors had been improving their quality and design , for instance Lenovo 's ThinkPad series was winning corporate customers away from Dell 's laptops , Dell 's customer service and reputation had been slipping . Dell remained the second-most profitable PC vendor , as it took 13 percent of operating profits in the PC industry during Q4 2012 , behind Apple Inc. 's Macintosh that took 45 percent , seven percent at Hewlett Packard , six percent at Lenovo and Asus , and one percent for Acer .
Soon after the passing of the 1931 Act , in the book published on the occasion of the Institute 's centenary celebration in 1934 , Harry Barnes , FRIBA , Chairman of the Registration Committee , mentioned that ARCUK could not be a rival of any architectural association , least of all the RIBA , given the way ARCUK was constituted . Barnes commented that the Act 's purpose was not protecting the architectural profession , and that the legitimate interests of the profession were best served by the ( then ) architectural associations in which some 80 per cent of those practising architecture were to be found .
According to a study by the China Earthquake Administration ( CEA ) , the earthquake occurred along the Longmenshan fault , a thrust structure along the border of the Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian Plate . Seismic activities concentrated on its mid-fracture ( known as Yingxiu-Beichuan fracture ) . The rupture lasted close to 120 sec , with the majority of energy released in the first 80 sec . Starting from Wenchuan , the rupture propagated at an average speed of 3.1 kilometers per second 49° toward north east , rupturing a total of about 300 km . Maximum displacement amounted to 9 meters . The focus was deeper than 10 km .
A second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of relations . It sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects . Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things . The idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space , and not necessarily related to anything . But in Whitehead 's view , relations take a primary role , perhaps even more important than the relata themselves . A student taking notes in one of Whitehead 's fall 1924 classes wrote that :
In 2010 , a number of workers committed suicide at a Foxconn operations in China . Apple , HP , and others stated that they were investigating the situation . Foxconn guards have been videotaped beating employees . Another employee killed himself in 2009 when an Apple prototype went missing , and claimed in messages to friends , that he had been beaten and interrogated .
The football team plays at Ryan Field ( formerly known as Dyche Stadium ) ; the basketball , wrestling , and volleyball teams play at Welsh-Ryan Arena . Northwestern 's athletic teams are nicknamed the Wildcats . Before 1924 , they were known as " The Purple " and unofficially as " The Fighting Methodists . " The name Wildcats was bestowed upon the university in 1924 by Wallace Abbey , a writer for the Chicago Daily Tribune who wrote that even in a loss to the University of Chicago , " Football players had not come down from Evanston ; wildcats would be a name better suited to [ Coach Glenn ] Thistletwaite 's boys . " The name was so popular that university board members made " wildcats " the official nickname just months later . In 1972 , the student body voted to change the official nickname from " Wildcats " to " Purple Haze " but the new name never stuck .
Uranium ore is mined in several ways : by open pit , underground , in-situ leaching , and borehole mining ( see uranium mining ) . Low-grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25 % uranium oxides . Extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan , Canada can contain up to 23 % uranium oxides on average . Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali . The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation , solvent extraction , and ion exchange . The resulting mixture , called yellowcake , contains at least 75 % uranium oxides U3O8 . Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion .
The monarchs of England and the United Kingdom had ministers in whom they placed special trust and who were regarded as the head of the government . Examples were Thomas Cromwell under Henry VIII ; William Cecil , Lord Burghley under Elizabeth I ; Clarendon under Charles II and Godolphin under Queen Anne . These ministers held a variety of formal posts , but were commonly known as " the minister " , the " chief minister " , the " first minister " and finally the " prime minister " .
Economic and political migrations made an impact across the empire . For example , the Russian and Austria-Habsburg annexation of the Crimean and Balkan regions respectively saw large influxes of Muslim refugees – 200,000 Crimean Tartars fleeing to Dobruja . Between 1783 and 1913 , approximately 5–7 million refugees flooded into the Ottoman Empire , at least 3.8 million of whom were from Russia . Some migrations left indelible marks such as political tension between parts of the empire ( e.g . Turkey and Bulgaria ) whereas centrifugal effects were noticed in other territories , simpler demographics emerging from diverse populations . Economies were also impacted with the loss of artisans , merchants , manufacturers and agriculturists . Since the 19th century , a large proportion of Muslim peoples from the Balkans emigrated to present-day Turkey . These people are called Muhacir . By the time the Ottoman Empire came to an end in 1922 , half of the urban population of Turkey was descended from Muslim refugees from Russia .
The western edge of the Oklahoma panhandle is out of alignment with its Texas border . The Oklahoma/New Mexico border is actually 2.1 to 2.2 miles east of the Texas line . The border between Texas and New Mexico was set first as a result of a survey by Spain in 1819 . It was then set along the 103rd Meridian . In the 1890s , when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques , it was discovered that the Texas line was not set along the 103rd Meridian . Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819 , and the actual 103rd Meridian was approximately 2.2 miles to the east . It was much easier to leave the mistake as it was than for Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the original surveying error . The placement of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border represents the true 103rd Meridian .
Portugal spearheaded European exploration of the world and the Age of Discovery . Prince Henry the Navigator , son of King João I , became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour . During this period , Portugal explored the Atlantic Ocean , discovering several Atlantic archipelagos like the Azores , Madeira , and Cape Verde , explored the African coast , colonized selected areas of Africa , discovered an eastern route to India via the Cape of Good Hope , discovered Brazil , explored the Indian Ocean , established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia , and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to China and Japan .
The Germanic peoples during the Migrations Period came into contact with other peoples ; in the case of the populations settling in the territory of modern Germany , they encountered Celts to the south , and Balts and Slavs towards the east . The Limes Germanicus was breached in AD 260 . Migrating Germanic tribes commingled with the local Gallo-Roman populations in what is now Swabia and Bavaria . The arrival of the Huns in Europe resulted in Hun conquest of large parts of Eastern Europe , the Huns initially were allies of the Roman Empire who fought against Germanic tribes , but later the Huns cooperated with the Germanic tribe of the Ostrogoths , and large numbers of Germans lived within the lands of the Hunnic Empire of Attila . Attila had both Hunnic and Germanic families and prominent Germanic chiefs amongst his close entourage in Europe . The Huns living in Germanic territories in Eastern Europe adopted an East Germanic language as their lingua franca . A major part of Attila 's army were Germans , during the Huns ' campaign against the Roman Empire . After Attila 's unexpected death the Hunnic Empire collapsed with the Huns disappearing as a people in Europe – who either escaped into Asia , or otherwise blended in amongst Europeans .
Depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials . While the metal itself is radioactive , its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium . Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces , as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material . Due to its high density , this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses . Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost . The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity ( uranium being only a weak alpha emitter ) .
In 1775 , Patrick Henry delivered his famous " Give me Liberty or Give me Death " speech in St. John 's Church in Richmond , crucial for deciding Virginia 's participation in the First Continental Congress and setting the course for revolution and independence . On April 18 , 1780 , the state capital was moved from the colonial capital of Williamsburg to Richmond , to provide a more centralized location for Virginia 's increasing westerly population , as well as to isolate the capital from British attack . The latter motive proved to be in vain , and in 1781 , under the command of Benedict Arnold , Richmond was burned by British troops , causing Governor Thomas Jefferson to flee as the Virginia militia , led by Sampson Mathews , defended the city .
Weather and climate in the coastal area are dominated by the cold , north-flowing Benguela current of the Atlantic Ocean which accounts for very low precipitation ( 50 mm per year or less ) , frequent dense fog , and overall lower temperatures than in the rest of the country . In Winter , occasionally a condition known as Bergwind ( German : Mountain breeze ) or Oosweer ( Afrikaans : East weather ) occurs , a hot dry wind blowing from the inland to the coast . As the area behind the coast is a desert , these winds can develop into sand storms with sand deposits in the Atlantic Ocean visible on satellite images .
In Classical Antiquity , the inquiry into the workings of the universe took place both in investigations aimed at such practical goals as establishing a reliable calendar or determining how to cure a variety of illnesses and in those abstract investigations known as natural philosophy . The ancient people who are considered the first scientists may have thought of themselves as natural philosophers , as practitioners of a skilled profession ( for example , physicians ) , or as followers of a religious tradition ( for example , temple healers ) .
In the final days of World War II in Yugoslavia , units of the Partisans were responsible for atrocities after the repatriations of Bleiburg , and accusations of culpability were later raised at the Yugoslav leadership under Tito . At the time , Josip Broz Tito repeatedly issued calls for surrender to the retreating column , offering amnesty and attempting to avoid a disorderly surrender . On 14 May he dispatched a telegram to the supreme headquarters Slovene Partisan Army prohibiting " in the sternest language " the execution of prisoners of war and commanding the transfer of the possible suspects to a military court .
There is a variety of annual events , beginning with the relatively new New Year 's Day Parade , fireworks display at the London Eye , the world 's second largest street party , the Notting Hill Carnival is held during the late August Bank Holiday each year . Traditional parades include November 's Lord Mayor 's Show , a centuries-old event celebrating the annual appointment of a new Lord Mayor of the City of London with a procession along the streets of the City , and June 's Trooping the Colour , a formal military pageant performed by regiments of the Commonwealth and British armies to celebrate the Queen 's Official Birthday .
The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals , the Soviet Union ( USSR ) and the United States ( US ) , for supremacy in spaceflight capability . It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II , enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel . The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security , and symbolic of ideological superiority . The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites , unmanned space probes of the Moon , Venus , and Mars , and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon . The competition began on August 2 , 1955 , when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year , by declaring they would also launch a satellite " in the near future " . The Soviet Union beat the US to this , with the October 4 , 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1 , and later beat the US to the first human in space , Yuri Gagarin , on April 12 , 1961 . The Space Race peaked with the July 20 , 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11 . The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions , and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations . A period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo–Soyuz Test Project , resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew .

It begins on Riverside Drive at the Interchurch Center . It then runs east between the campuses of Barnard College and the Union Theological Seminary , then crosses Broadway and runs between the campuses of Columbia University and Teacher 's College . The street is interrupted by Morningside Park . It then continues east , eventually running along the southern edge of Marcus Garvey Park , passing by 58 West , the former residence of Maya Angelou . It then continues through Spanish Harlem ; when it crosses Pleasant Avenue it becomes a two‑way street and continues nearly to the East River , where for automobiles , it turns north and becomes Paladino Avenue , and for pedestrians , continues as a bridge across FDR Drive .
Tanzania : Dar es Salaam was the torch 's only stop in Africa , on April 13 . The relay began at the grand terminal of the TAZARA Railway , which was China 's largest foreign aid project of the 1970s , and continued for 5 km through the old city to the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium in Temeke , which was built with Chinese aid in 2005 . The torch was lit by Vice-President Ali Mohamed Shein . About a thousand people followed the relay , waving the Olympic flag . The only noted instance of protest was Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai 's withdrawal from the list of torchbearers , in protest against human rights abuses in Tibet .
Several systems were proposed as the new standard for the US , including the Japanese MUSE system , but all were rejected by the FCC because of their higher bandwidth requirements . At this time , the number of television channels was growing rapidly and bandwidth was already a problem . A new standard had to be more efficient , needing less bandwidth for HDTV than the existing NTSC .
The city grew as the population did , coming up against the lake 's waters . As the depth of the lake water fluctuated , Mexico City was subject to periodic flooding . A major labor draft , the desagüe , compelled thousands of Indians over the colonial period to work on infrastructure to prevent flooding . Floods were not only an inconvenience but also a health hazard , since during flood periods human waste polluted the city 's streets . By draining the area , the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread . However , draining the wetlands also changed the habitat for fish and birds and the areas accessible for Indian cultivation close to the capital .
Often taxonomists prefer to use phylogenetic analysis to determine whether a population can be considered a subspecies . Phylogenetic analysis relies on the concept of derived characteristics that are not shared between groups , usually applying to populations that are allopatric ( geographically separated ) and therefore discretely bounded . This would make a subspecies , evolutionarily speaking , a clade – a group with a common evolutionary ancestor population . The smooth gradation of human genetic variation in general tends to rule out any idea that human population groups can be considered monophyletic ( cleanly divided ) , as there appears to always have been considerable gene flow between human populations . Rachel Caspari ( 2003 ) have argued that clades are by definition monophyletic groups ( a taxon that includes all descendants of a given ancestor ) and since no groups currently regarded as races are monophyletic , none of those groups can be clades .
Traditionally the Rajputs , Jats , Meenas , Gurjars , Bhils , Rajpurohit , Charans , Yadavs , Bishnois , Sermals , PhulMali ( Saini ) and other tribes made a great contribution in building the state of Rajasthan . All these tribes suffered great difficulties in protecting their culture and the land . Millions of them were killed trying to protect their land . A number of Gurjars had been exterminated in Bhinmal and Ajmer areas fighting with the invaders . Bhils once ruled Kota . Meenas were rulers of Bundi and the Dhundhar region .
This time they succeeded , and on 31 December 1600 , the Queen granted a Royal Charter to " George , Earl of Cumberland , and 215 Knights , Aldermen , and Burgesses " under the name , Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading with the East Indies . For a period of fifteen years the charter awarded the newly formed company a monopoly on trade with all countries east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan . Sir James Lancaster commanded the first East India Company voyage in 1601 and returned in 1603. and in March 1604 Sir Henry Middleton commanded the second voyage . General William Keeling , a captain during the second voyage , led the third voyage from 1607 to 1610 .
At the age of 21 he settled in Paris . Thereafter , during the last 18 years of his life , he gave only some 30 public performances , preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon . He supported himself by selling his compositions and teaching piano , for which he was in high demand . Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries , including Robert Schumann . In 1835 he obtained French citizenship . After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska , from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer George Sand . A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838–39 was one of his most productive periods of composition . In his last years , he was financially supported by his admirer Jane Stirling , who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848 . Through most of his life , Chopin suffered from poor health . He died in Paris in 1849 , probably of tuberculosis .
Beginning in April 1985 , Madonna embarked on her first concert tour in North America , The Virgin Tour , with the Beastie Boys as her opening act . She progressed from playing CBGB and the Mudd Club to playing large sporting arenas . At that time she released two more hit singles from the album , " Angel " and " Dress You Up " . In July , Penthouse and Playboy magazines published a number of nude photos of Madonna , taken in New York in 1978 . She had posed for the photographs as she needed money at the time , and was paid as little as $ 25 a session . The publication of the photos caused a media uproar , but Madonna remained " unapologetic and defiant " . The photographs were ultimately sold for up to $ 100,000 . She referred to these events at the 1985 outdoor Live Aid charity concert , saying that she would not take her jacket off because " [ the media ] might hold it against me ten years from now . "
The first truth explains the nature of dukkha . Dukkha is commonly translated as " suffering " , " anxiety " , " unsatisfactoriness " , " unease " , etc. , and it is said to have the following three aspects :
Although professional wrestling started out as petty acts in sideshows , traveling circuses and carnivals , today it is a billion-dollar industry . Revenue is drawn from live event ticket sales , network television broadcasts , pay-per-view broadcasts , personal appearances by performers , branded merchandise and home video . Particularly since the 1950s , pro wrestling events have frequently been responsible for sellout crowds at large arenas , including Madison Square Garden , as well as football stadiums , by promotions including the WWE , the NWA territory system , WCW , and AWA . Pro wrestling was also instrumental in making pay-per-view a viable method of content delivery . Annual shows such as WrestleMania , SummerSlam , Royal Rumble , and formerly Bash at the Beach , Halloween Havoc and Starrcade are among the highest-selling pay-per-view programming each year . In modern day , internet programming has been utilized by a number of companies to air web shows , internet pay-per-views ( iPPVs ) or on-demand content , helping to generate internet-related revenue earnings from the evolving World Wide Web .
The German rocket center in Peenemünde was located in the eastern part of Germany , which became the Soviet zone of occupation . On Stalin 's orders , the Soviet Union sent its best rocket engineers to this region to see what they could salvage for future weapons systems . The Soviet rocket engineers were led by Sergei Korolev . He had been involved in space clubs and early Soviet rocket design in the 1930s , but was arrested in 1938 during Joseph Stalin 's Great Purge and imprisoned for six years in Siberia . After the war , he became the USSR 's chief rocket and spacecraft engineer , essentially the Soviet counterpart to von Braun . His identity was kept a state secret throughout the Cold War , and he was identified publicly only as " the Chief Designer . " In the West , his name was only officially revealed when he died in 1966 .
Beyoncé has been described as a having a wide-ranging sex appeal , with music journalist Touré writing that since the release of Dangerously in Love , she has " become a crossover sex symbol " . Offstage Beyoncé says that while she likes to dress sexily , her onstage dress " is absolutely for the stage . " Due to her curves and the term 's catchiness , in the 2000s , the media often used the term " Bootylicious " ( a portmanteau of the words booty and delicious ) to describe Beyoncé , the term popularized by Destiny 's Child 's single of the same name . In 2006 , it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary .
Himachal Pradesh is spread across valleys , and 90 % of the population lives in villages and towns . However , the state has achieved 100 % hygiene and practically no single house is without a toilet . The villages are well connected to roads , public health centers , and now with Lokmitra kendra using high-speed broadband . Shimla district has maximum urban population of 25 % . According to a 2005 Transparency International survey , Himachal Pradesh is ranked the second-least corrupt state in the country after Kerala . The hill stations of the state are among the most visited places in the country . The government has successfully imposed environmental protection and tourism development , meeting European standards , and it is the only state which forbids the use of polyethylene and tobacco products .

The group changed their name to Destiny 's Child in 1996 , based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah . In 1997 , Destiny 's Child released their major label debut song " Killing Time " on the soundtrack to the 1997 film , Men in Black . The following year , the group released their self-titled debut album , scoring their first major hit " No , No , No " . The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry , with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R & B/Soul Album of the Year , Best R & B/Soul or Rap New Artist , and Best R & B/Soul Single for " No , No , No " . The group released their multi-platinum second album The Writing 's on the Wall in 1999 . The record features some of the group 's most widely known songs such as " Bills , Bills , Bills " , the group 's first number-one single , " Jumpin ' Jumpin ' " and " Say My Name " , which became their most successful song at the time , and would remain one of their signature songs . " Say My Name " won the Best R & B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R & B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards . The Writing 's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide . During this time , Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson , an original member of Boyz II Men , on the song " After All Is Said and Done " for the soundtrack to the 1999 film , The Best Man .
In August 2008 , West revealed plans to open 10 Fatburger restaurants in the Chicago area ; the first was set to open in September 2008 in Orland Park . The second followed in January 2009 , while a third location is yet to be revealed , although the process is being finalized . His company , KW Foods LLC , bought the rights to the chain in Chicago . Ultimately , in 2009 , only two locations actually opened . In February 2011 , West shut down the Fatburger located in Orland Park . Later that year , the remaining Beverly location also was shuttered .
In principle , the Planck constant could be determined by examining the spectrum of a black-body radiator or the kinetic energy of photoelectrons , and this is how its value was first calculated in the early twentieth century . In practice , these are no longer the most accurate methods . The CODATA value quoted here is based on three watt-balance measurements of KJ2RK and one inter-laboratory determination of the molar volume of silicon , but is mostly determined by a 2007 watt-balance measurement made at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) . Five other measurements by three different methods were initially considered , but not included in the final refinement as they were too imprecise to affect the result .
In 2011 , the International Energy Agency said that " the development of affordable , inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits . It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous , inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource , enhance sustainability , reduce pollution , lower the costs of mitigating global warming , and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise . These advantages are global . Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments ; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared " .
On the eastern front , progress was very slow . The Russian army was heavily dependent upon its main magazines in Poland , and the Prussian army launched several successful raids against them . One of them , led by general Platen in September resulted in the loss of 2,000 Russians , mostly captured , and the destruction of 5,000 wagons . Deprived of men , the Prussians had to resort to this new sort of warfare , raiding , to delay the advance of their enemies . Nonetheless , at the end of the year , they suffered two critical setbacks . The Russians under Zakhar Chernyshev and Pyotr Rumyantsev stormed Kolberg in Pomerania , while the Austrians captured Schweidnitz . The loss of Kolberg cost Prussia its last port on the Baltic Sea . In Britain , it was speculated that a total Prussian collapse was now imminent .
Since the construction of its oldest buildings , the university 's physical plant has grown substantially . Over the years 29 residence halls have been built to accommodate students and each has been constructed with its own chapel . Many academic building were added together with a system of libraries , the most prominent of which is the Theodore Hesburgh Library , built in 1963 and today containing almost 4 million books . Since 2004 , several buildings have been added , including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center , the Guglielmino Complex , and the Jordan Hall of Science . Additionally , a new residence for men , Duncan Hall , was begun on March 8 , 2007 , and began accepting residents for the Fall 2008 semester . Ryan Hall was completed and began housing undergraduate women in the fall of 2009 . A new engineering building , Stinson-Remick Hall , a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building , Geddes Hall , and a law school addition have recently been completed as well . Additionally the new hockey arena opened in the fall of 2011 . The Stayer Center for Executive Education , which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive Education Department opened in March 2013 just South of the Mendoza College of Business building . Because of its long athletic tradition , the university features also many building dedicated to sport . The most famous is Notre Dame Stadium , home of the Fighting Irish football team ; it has been renovated several times and today it can hold more than 80 thousand people . Prominent venues include also the Edmund P. Joyce Center , with indoor basketball and volleyball courts , and the Compton Family Ice Arena , a two-rink facility dedicated to hockey . Also , there are many outdoor fields , as the Frank Eck Stadium for baseball .
The University of Oklahoma has several institutions of higher learning in the city and metropolitan area , with OU Medicine and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center campuses located east of downtown in the Oklahoma Health Center district , and the main campus located to the south in the suburb of Norman . The OU Medicine hosting the state 's only Level-One trauma center . OU Health Sciences Center is one of the nation 's largest independent medical centers , employing more than 12,000 people . OU is one of only four major universities in the nation to operate six medical schools . [ clarification needed ]
Between 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941 , 16 British cities suffered aerial raids with at least 100 long tons of high explosives . Over a period of 267 days , London was attacked 71 times , Birmingham , Liverpool and Plymouth eight times , Bristol six , Glasgow five , Southampton four , Portsmouth and Hull three and a minimum of one large raid on eight other cities . This was a result of a rapid escalation starting on 24 August 1940 , when night bombers aiming for RAF airfields drifted off course and accidentally destroyed several London homes , killing civilians , combined with the UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill 's retaliatory bombing of Berlin on the following night .

Israel is considered the most advanced country in Southwest Asia and the Middle East in economic and industrial development . Israel 's quality university education and the establishment of a highly motivated and educated populace is largely responsible for spurring the country 's high technology boom and rapid economic development . In 2010 , it joined the OECD . The country is ranked 3rd in the region and 38th worldwide on the World Bank 's Ease of Doing Business Index as well as in the World Economic Forum 's Global Competitiveness Report . It has the second-largest number of startup companies in the world ( after the United States ) and the largest number of NASDAQ-listed companies outside North America .
During the years 1940-1955 , the rate of decline in the U.S. death rate accelerated from 2 % per year to 8 % per year , then returned to the historical rate of 2 % per year . The dramatic decline in the immediate post-war years has been attributed to the rapid development of new treatments and vaccines for infectious disease that occurred during these years . Vaccine development continued to accelerate , with the most notable achievement of the period being Jonas Salk 's 1954 development of the polio vaccine under the funding of the non-profit National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis . The vaccine process was never patented , but was instead given to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture as a low-cost generic . In 1960 Maurice Hilleman of Merck Sharp & Dohme identified the SV40 virus , which was later shown to cause tumors in many mammalian species . It was later determined that SV40 was present as a contaminant in polio vaccine lots that had been administered to 90 % of the children in the United States . The contamination appears to have originated both in the original cell stock and in monkey tissue used for production . In 2004 the United States Cancer Institute announced that it had concluded that SV40 is not associated with cancer in people .
Among all cities in the Mediterranean part of the European Union , Limassol has one of the warmest winters , in the period January – February average temperature is 17–18 °C ( 63–64 °F ) during the day and 7–8 °C ( 45–46 °F ) at night , in other coastal locations in Cyprus is generally 16–17 °C ( 61–63 °F ) during the day and 6–8 °C ( 43–46 °F ) at night . During March , Limassol has average temperatures of 19–20 °C ( 66–68 °F ) during the day and 9–11 °C ( 48–52 °F ) at night , in other coastal locations in Cyprus is generally 17–19 °C ( 63–66 °F ) during the day and 8–10 °C ( 46–50 °F ) at night .
In Chapter II , Darwin specifies that the distinction between species and varieties is arbitrary , with experts disagreeing and changing their decisions when new forms were found . He concludes that " a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient species " and that " species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties " . He argues for the ubiquity of variation in nature . Historians have noted that naturalists had long been aware that the individuals of a species differed from one another , but had generally considered such variations to be limited and unimportant deviations from the archetype of each species , that archetype being a fixed ideal in the mind of God . Darwin and Wallace made variation among individuals of the same species central to understanding the natural world .
A broad operational definition is sometimes used to encompass the complexity of these diverse phenomena , where a gene is defined as a union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products . This definition categorizes genes by their functional products ( proteins or RNA ) rather than their specific DNA loci , with regulatory elements classified as gene-associated regions .
RCA 45s were also adapted to the smaller spindle of an LP player with a plastic snap-in insert known as a " spider " . These inserts , commissioned by RCA president David Sarnoff and invented by Thomas Hutchison , were prevalent starting in the 1960s , selling in the tens of millions per year during the 45 rpm heyday . In countries outside the U.S. , 45s often had the smaller album-sized holes , e.g. , Australia and New Zealand , or as in the United Kingdom , especially before the 1970s , the disc had a small hole within a circular central section held only by three or four lands so that it could be easily punched out if desired ( typically for use in jukeboxes ) .
Further studies , e.g . Jerome Ravetz 1971 Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems referred to the role of the scientific community , as a social construct , in accepting or rejecting ( objective ) scientific knowledge . The Science wars of the 1990 were about the influence of especially French philosophers , which denied the objectivity of science in general or seemed to do so . They described as well differences between the idealized model of a pure science and the actual scientific practice ; while scientism , a revival of the positivism approach , saw in precise measurement and rigorous calculation the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies . However , more recently some of the leading critical theorists have recognized that their postmodern deconstructions have at times been counter-productive , and are providing intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests . Bruno Latour noted that " dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives . Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies ? Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we meant ? "
In 2013 , Houston was identified as the # 1 U.S. city for job creation by the U.S. Bureau of Statistics after it was not only the first major city to regain all the jobs lost in the preceding economic downturn , but after the crash , more than two jobs were added for every one lost . Economist and vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership Patrick Jankowski attributed Houston 's success to the ability of the region 's real estate and energy industries to learn from historical mistakes . Furthermore , Jankowski stated that " more than 100 foreign-owned companies relocated , expanded or started new businesses in Houston " between 2008 and 2010 , and this openness to external business boosted job creation during a period when domestic demand was problematically low . Also in 2013 , Houston again appeared on Forbes ' list of Best Places for Business and Careers .
Richard Sander claims that by artificially elevating minority students into schools they otherwise would not be capable of attending , this discourages them and tends to engender failure and high dropout rates for these students . For example , about half of black college students rank in the bottom 20 percent of their classes , black law school graduates are four times as likely to fail bar exams as are whites , and interracial friendships are more likely to form among students with relatively similar levels of academic preparation ; thus , blacks and Hispanics are more socially integrated on campuses where they are less academically mismatched . He claims that the supposed " beneficiaries " of affirmative action – minorities – do not actually benefit and rather are harmed by the policy . Sander 's claims have been disputed , and his empirical analyses have been subject to substantial criticism . A group including some of the country 's lead statistical methodologists told the Supreme Court that Sander 's analyses were sufficiently flawed that the Court would be wise to ignore them entirely . At the same time many scholars have found that minorities gain substantially from affirmative action .
A very small amount of water vapor inside a light bulb can significantly affect lamp darkening . Water vapor dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen at the hot filament . The oxygen attacks the tungsten metal , and the resulting tungsten oxide particles travel to cooler parts of the lamp . Hydrogen from water vapor reduces the oxide , reforming water vapor and continuing this water cycle . The equivalent of a drop of water distributed over 500,000 lamps will significantly increase darkening . Small amounts of substances such as zirconium are placed within the lamp as a getter to react with any oxygen that may bake out of the lamp components during operation .
In the latter part of the second revolution , Thomas Alva Edison developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world and is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory . In 1882 , Edison switched on the world 's first large-scale electrical supply network that provided 110 volts direct current to fifty-nine customers in lower Manhattan . Also toward the end of the second industrial revolution , Nikola Tesla made many contributions in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
Indian astronomer and mathematician Aryabhata ( 476-550 ) , in his Aryabhatiya ( 499 ) introduced a number of trigonometric functions ( including sine , versine , cosine and inverse sine ) , trigonometric tables , and techniques and algorithms of algebra . In 628 AD , Brahmagupta suggested that gravity was a force of attraction . He also lucidly explained the use of zero as both a placeholder and a decimal digit , along with the Hindu-Arabic numeral system now used universally throughout the world . Arabic translations of the two astronomers ' texts were soon available in the Islamic world , introducing what would become Arabic numerals to the Islamic World by the 9th century . During the 14th–16th centuries , the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics made significant advances in astronomy and especially mathematics , including fields such as trigonometry and analysis . In particular , Madhava of Sangamagrama is considered the " founder of mathematical analysis " .
Oklahoma City also has its share of very brutal crimes , particularly in the 1970s . The worst of which occurred in 1978 , when six employees of a Sirloin Stockade restaurant on the city 's south side were murdered execution-style in the restaurant 's freezer . An intensive investigation followed , and the three individuals involved , who also killed three others in Purcell , Oklahoma , were identified . One , Harold Stafford , died in a motorcycle accident in Tulsa not long after the restaurant murders . Another , Verna Stafford , was sentenced to life without parole after being granted a new trial after she had previously been sentenced to death . Roger Dale Stafford , considered the mastermind of the murder spree , was executed by lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in 1995 .
The Buddhist texts are probably the earliest describing meditation techniques . They describe meditative practices and states that existed before the Buddha as well as those first developed within Buddhism . Two Upanishads written after the rise of Buddhism do contain full-fledged descriptions of yoga as a means to liberation .
The Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London , which originated nearby . Marble Arch and Wellington Arch , at the north and south ends of Park Lane respectively , have royal connections , as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington . Nelson 's Column is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square , one of the focal points of central London . Older buildings are mainly brick built , most commonly the yellow London stock brick or a warm orange-red variety , often decorated with carvings and white plaster mouldings .
The first non-Native American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was Dominican trader Juan Rodriguez ( transliterated to Dutch as Jan Rodrigues ) . Born in Santo Domingo of Portuguese and African descent , he arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–1614 , trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch . Broadway , from 159th Street to 218th Street , is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor .
The Han-era Chinese sailed in a variety of ships differing from those of previous eras , such as the tower ship . The junk design was developed and realized during Han . Junks featured a square-ended bow and stern , a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost , and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western vessels . Moreover , Han ships were the first in the world to be steered using a rudder at the stern , in contrast to the simpler steering oar used for riverine transport , allowing them to sail on the high seas .
Also with respect to copyright , the American film industry helped to change the social construct of intellectual property via its trade organization , the Motion Picture Association of America . In amicus briefs in important cases , in lobbying before Congress , and in its statements to the public , the MPAA has advocated strong protection of intellectual-property rights . In framing its presentations , the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor . Additionally Congress 's awareness of the position of the United States as the world 's largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property . These doctrinal reforms have further strengthened the industry , lending the MPAA even more power and authority .
The team placed fifth in the Premier League automatically qualifies for the UEFA Europa League , and the sixth and seventh-placed teams can also qualify , depending on the winners of the two domestic cup competitions i.e . the FA Cup and the Capital One Cup ( League Cup ) . Two Europa League places are reserved for the winners of each tournament ; if the winner of either the FA Cup or League Cup qualifies for the Champions League , then that place will go to the next-best placed finisher in the Premier League . A further place in the UEFA Europa League is also available via the Fair Play initiative . If the Premier League has one of the three highest Fair Play rankings in Europe , the highest ranked team in the Premier League Fair Play standings which has not already qualified for Europe will automatically qualify for the UEFA Europa League first qualifying round .
Under the Bretton Woods system established after World War II , the value of gold was fixed to $ 35 per ounce , and the value of the U.S. dollar was thus anchored to the value of gold . Rising government spending in the 1960s , however , led to doubts about the ability of the United States to maintain this convertibility , gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold , and as a result the value of the dollar began to decline . Facing an emerging currency crisis and the imminent danger that the United States would no longer be able to redeem dollars for gold , gold convertibility was finally terminated in 1971 by President Nixon , resulting in the " Nixon shock " .
The Swiss climate is generally temperate , but can vary greatly between the localities , from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the often pleasant near Mediterranean climate at Switzerland 's southern tip . There are some valley areas in the southern part of Switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found . Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing . The less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks , while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion , during these periods , thus seeing no sun for weeks .
While Old Czech had a basic alphabet from which a general set of orthographical correspondences was drawn , it did not have a standard orthography . It also contained a number of sound clusters which no longer exist ; allowing ě ( /jɛ/ ) after soft consonants , which has since shifted to e ( /ɛ/ ) , and allowing complex consonant clusters to be pronounced all at once rather than syllabically . A phonological phenomenon , Havlik 's law ( which began in Proto-Slavic and took various forms in other Slavic languages ) , appeared in Old Czech ; counting backwards from the end of a clause , every odd-numbered yer was vocalized as a vowel , while the other yers disappeared .
IBM has 12 research laboratories worldwide , bundled into IBM Research . As of 2013 [ update ] the company held the record for most patents generated by a business for 22 consecutive years . Its employees have garnered five Nobel Prizes , six Turing Awards , ten National Medals of Technology and five National Medals of Science . Notable company inventions or developments include the automated teller machine ( ATM ) , the floppy disk , the hard disk drive , the magnetic stripe card , the relational database , the Universal Product Code ( UPC ) , the financial swap , the Fortran programming language , SABRE airline reservation system , dynamic random-access memory ( DRAM ) , copper wiring in semiconductors , the silicon-on-insulator ( SOI ) semiconductor manufacturing process , and Watson artificial intelligence .
A second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of relations . It sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects . Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things . The idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space , and not necessarily related to anything . But in Whitehead 's view , relations take a primary role , perhaps even more important than the relata themselves . A student taking notes in one of Whitehead 's fall 1924 classes wrote that :
It is the third language of South Africa in terms of native speakers ( ~13.5 % ) , of whom 53 percent are Coloureds and 42.4 percent Whites . In 1996 , 40 percent of South Africans reported to know Afrikaans at least at a very basic level of communication . It is the lingua franca in Namibia , where it is spoken natively in 11 percent of households . In total , Afrikaans is the first language in South Africa alone of about 6.8 million people and is estimated to be a second language for at least 10 million people worldwide , compared to over 23 million and 5 million respectively , for Dutch .
The first visible institution to run into trouble in the United States was the Southern California–based IndyMac , a spin-off of Countrywide Financial . Before its failure , IndyMac Bank was the largest savings and loan association in the Los Angeles market and the seventh largest mortgage originator in the United States . The failure of IndyMac Bank on July 11 , 2008 , was the fourth largest bank failure in United States history up until the crisis precipitated even larger failures , and the second largest failure of a regulated thrift . IndyMac Bank 's parent corporation was IndyMac Bancorp until the FDIC seized IndyMac Bank . IndyMac Bancorp filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in July 2008 .
The Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century AD ; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories . Economic issues , including inflation , and external pressure on the frontiers combined to make the 3rd century politically unstable , with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers . Military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century , mainly in response to the war with Sassanid Persia , which revived in the middle of the 3rd century . The army doubled in size , and cavalry and smaller units replaced the legion as the main tactical unit . The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial , or landowning , class , and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns . More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army , which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers .
Following World War II , Britain retained control of both British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland as protectorates . In 1945 , during the Potsdam Conference , the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland , but only under close supervision and on the condition — first proposed by the Somali Youth League ( SYL ) and other nascent Somali political organizations , such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali ( HDMS ) and the Somali National League ( SNL ) — that Somalia achieve independence within ten years . British Somaliland remained a protectorate of Britain until 1960 .
Presbyterians place great importance upon education and lifelong learning . Continuous study of the scriptures , theological writings , and understanding and interpretation of church doctrine are embodied in several statements of faith and catechisms formally adopted by various branches of the church , often referred to as " subordinate standards " . It is generally considered that the point of such learning is to enable one to put one 's faith into practice ; some Presbyterians generally exhibit their faith in action as well as words , by generosity , hospitality , as well as proclaiming the gospel of Christ .
Beyoncé announced a hiatus from her music career in January 2010 , heeding her mother 's advice , " to live life , to be inspired by things again " . During the break she and her father parted ways as business partners . Beyoncé 's musical break lasted nine months and saw her visit multiple European cities , the Great Wall of China , the Egyptian pyramids , Australia , English music festivals and various museums and ballet performances .
In addition to Virginia and Confederate government offices and hospitals , a railroad hub , and one of the South 's largest slave markets , Richmond had the largest factory in the Confederacy , the Tredegar Iron Works , which turned out artillery and other munitions , including the 723 tons of armor plating that covered the CSS Virginia , the world 's first ironclad used in war , as well as much of the Confederates ' heavy ordnance machinery . The Confederate Congress shared quarters with the Virginia General Assembly in the Virginia State Capitol , with the Confederacy 's executive mansion , the " White House of the Confederacy " , located two blocks away . The Seven Days Battles followed in late June and early July 1862 , during which Union General McClellan threatened to take Richmond but ultimately failed .
Humans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps . For instance , dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps . Dogs may have provided warmth , as referred to in the Australian Aboriginal expression " three dog night " ( an exceptionally cold night ) , and they would have alerted the camp to the presence of predators or strangers , using their acute hearing to provide an early warning .
Most former British colonies and protectorates are among the 53 member states of the Commonwealth of Nations , a non-political , voluntary association of equal members , comprising a population of around 2.2 billion people . Sixteen Commonwealth realms voluntarily continue to share the British monarch , Queen Elizabeth II , as their head of state . These sixteen nations are distinct and equal legal entities – the United Kingdom , Australia , Canada , New Zealand , Papua New Guinea , Antigua and Barbuda , The Bahamas , Barbados , Belize , Grenada , Jamaica , Saint Kitts and Nevis , Saint Lucia , Saint Vincent and the Grenadines , Solomon Islands and Tuvalu .
The financial crisis was not widely predicted by mainstream economists except Raghuram Rajan , who instead spoke of the Great Moderation . A number of heterodox economists predicted the crisis , with varying arguments . Dirk Bezemer in his research credits ( with supporting argument and estimates of timing ) 12 economists with predicting the crisis : Dean Baker ( US ) , Wynne Godley ( UK ) , Fred Harrison ( UK ) , Michael Hudson ( US ) , Eric Janszen ( US ) , Steve Keen ( Australia ) , Jakob Brøchner Madsen & Jens Kjaer Sørensen ( Denmark ) , Kurt Richebächer ( US ) , Nouriel Roubini ( US ) , Peter Schiff ( US ) , and Robert Shiller ( US ) . Examples of other experts who gave indications of a financial crisis have also been given . Not surprisingly , the Austrian economic school regarded the crisis as a vindication and classic example of a predictable credit-fueled bubble that could not forestall the disregarded but inevitable effect of an artificial , manufactured laxity in monetary supply , a perspective that even former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan in Congressional testimony confessed himself forced to return to .
Cesare Beccaria , a jurist and one of the great Enlightenment writers , became famous for his masterpiece Of Crimes and Punishments ( 1764 ) , which was later translated into 22 languages . Another prominent intellectual was Francesco Mario Pagano , who wrote important studies such as Saggi Politici ( Political Essays , 1783 ) , one of the major works of the Enlightenment in Naples , and Considerazioni sul processo criminale ( Considerations on the criminal trial , 1787 ) , which established him as an international authority on criminal law .
Red is associated with dominance in a number of animal species . For example , in mandrills , red coloration of the face is greatest in alpha males , increasingly less prominent in lower ranking subordinates , and directly correlated with levels of testosterone . Red can also affect the perception of dominance by others , leading to significant differences in mortality , reproductive success and parental investment between individuals displaying red and those not . In humans , wearing red has been linked with increased performance in competitions , including professional sport and multiplayer video games . Controlled tests have demonstrated that wearing red does not increase performance or levels of testosterone during exercise , so the effect is likely to be produced by perceived rather than actual performance . Judges of tae kwon do have been shown to favor competitors wearing red protective gear over blue , and , when asked , a significant majority of people say that red abstract shapes are more " dominant " , " aggressive " , and " likely to win a physical competition " than blue shapes . In contrast to its positive effect in physical competition and dominance behavior , exposure to red decreases performance in cognitive tasks and elicits aversion in psychological tests where subjects are placed in an " achievement " context ( e.g . taking an IQ test ) .
In April 2010 , Shell announced its intention to divest from downstream business of all African countries except South Africa and Egypt to Vitol and " Helios " . In several countries such as Tunisia , protests and strikes broke out . Shell denied rumours of the sellout . Shell continues however upstream activities/extracting crude oil in the oil-rich Niger Delta as well as downstream/commercial activities in South Africa . In June 2013 , the company announced a strategic review of its operations in Nigeria , hinting that assets could be divested . In August 2014 , the company disclosed it was in the process of finalizing the sale of its interests in four Nigerian oil fields .
At a convention of citizens called to select a new provisional ruler , Gutierrez obtained the vote , with P. J. Escalante for his deputy , and a council to guide the administration . Santa Anna ordered the reinstatement of Mendarozqueta as comandante general . Gutiérrez yielded , but Escalante refused to surrender office , demonstrations of support ensued , but Escalante yielded when troops were summoned from Zacatecas . A new election brought a new legislature , and conforming governors . In September 1835 José Urrea a federalist army officer came into power .
A species can be listed in two ways . The United States Fish and Wildlife Service ( FWS ) or NOAA Fisheries ( also called the National Marine Fisheries Service ) can directly list a species through its candidate assessment program , or an individual or organizational petition may request that the FWS or NMFS list a species . A " species " under the act can be a true taxonomic species , a subspecies , or in the case of vertebrates , a " distinct population segment . " The procedures are the same for both types except with the person/organization petition , there is a 90-day screening period .
In 1958 , Korolev upgraded the R-7 to be able to launch a 400-kilogram ( 880 lb ) payload to the Moon . Three secret 1958 attempts to launch Luna E-1-class impactor probes failed . The fourth attempt , Luna 1 , launched successfully on January 2 , 1959 , but missed the Moon . The fifth attempt on June 18 also failed at launch . The 390-kilogram ( 860 lb ) Luna 2 successfully impacted the Moon on September 14 , 1959 . The 278.5-kilogram ( 614 lb ) Luna 3 successfully flew by the Moon and sent back pictures of its far side on October 6 , 1959 .
Most modern Chinese dictionaries and Chinese dictionaries sold to English speakers use the traditional radical-based character index in a section at the front , while the main body of the dictionary arranges the main character entries alphabetically according to their pinyin spelling . To find a character with unknown sound using one of these dictionaries , the reader finds the radical and stroke number of the character , as before , and locates the character in the radical index . The character 's entry will have the character 's pronunciation in pinyin written down ; the reader then turns to the main dictionary section and looks up the pinyin spelling alphabetically .
The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986 , which left London as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration . In 2000 , London-wide government was restored , with the creation of the Greater London Authority . To celebrate the start of the 21st century , the Millennium Dome , London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed . On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics , making London the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times . In January 2015 , Greater London 's population was estimated to be 8.63 million , the highest level since 1939 .
In 2004 , worldwide sales of audio CDs , CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs . By 2007 , 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide . CDs are increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution , with the result that audio CD sales rates in the U.S. have dropped about 50 % from their peak ; however , they remain one of the primary distribution methods for the music industry . In 2014 , revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time .
Despite being a persistent critic of some of the government 's policies , the paper supported Labour in both subsequent elections the party won . For the 2005 general election , The Sun backed Blair and Labour for a third consecutive election win and vowed to give him " one last chance " to fulfil his promises , despite berating him for several weaknesses including a failure to control immigration . However , it did speak of its hope that the Conservatives ( led by Michael Howard ) would one day be fit for a return to government . This election ( Blair had declared it would be his last as prime minister ) resulted in Labour 's third successive win but with a much reduced majority .
In the 1960s , Downtown Houston consisted of a collection of mid-rise office structures . Downtown was on the threshold of an energy industry–led boom in 1970 . A succession of skyscrapers were built throughout the 1970s—many by real estate developer Gerald D. Hines—culminating with Houston 's tallest skyscraper , the 75-floor , 1,002-foot ( 305 m ) -tall JPMorgan Chase Tower ( formerly the Texas Commerce Tower ) , completed in 1982 . It is the tallest structure in Texas , 15th tallest building in the United States , and the 85th tallest skyscraper in the world , based on highest architectural feature . In 1983 , the 71-floor , 992-foot ( 302 m ) -tall Wells Fargo Plaza ( formerly Allied Bank Plaza ) was completed , becoming the second-tallest building in Houston and Texas . Based on highest architectural feature , it is the 17th tallest in the United States and the 95th tallest in the world . In 2007 , downtown Houston had over 43 million square feet ( 4,000,000 m² ) of office space .
A zygote initially develops into a hollow sphere , called a blastula , which undergoes rearrangement and differentiation . In sponges , blastula larvae swim to a new location and develop into a new sponge . In most other groups , the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement . It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber , and two separate germ layers — an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm . In most cases , a mesoderm also develops between them . These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs .
No provision within the constitution grants the monarch an ability to veto legislation directly ; however , no provision prohibits the sovereign from withholding royal assent , which effectively constitutes a veto . When the Spanish media asked King Juan Carlos if he would endorse the bill legalising same-sex marriages , he answered " Soy el Rey de España y no el de Bélgica " ( " I am the King of Spain and not that of Belgium " ) —a reference to King Baudouin I of Belgium , who had refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion . The King gave royal assent to Law 13/2005 on 1 July 2005 ; the law was gazetted in the Boletín Oficial del Estado on 2 July and came into effect on 3 July 2005 . Likewise , in 2010 , King Juan Carlos gave royal assent to a law permitting abortion on demand .
The French planned to invade the British Isles during 1759 by accumulating troops near the mouth of the Loire and concentrating their Brest and Toulon fleets . However , two sea defeats prevented this . In August , the Mediterranean fleet under Jean-François de La Clue-Sabran was scattered by a larger British fleet under Edward Boscawen at the Battle of Lagos . In the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November , the British admiral Edward Hawke with 23 ships of the line caught the French Brest fleet with 21 ships of the line under Marshal de Conflans and sank , captured , or forced many of them aground , putting an end to the French plans .
In 1950 , whites represented 94.7 % of Boston 's population . From the 1950s to the end of the 20th century , the proportion of non-Hispanic whites in the city declined ; in 2000 , non-Hispanic whites made up 49.5 % of the city 's population , making the city majority-minority for the first time . However , in recent years the city has experienced significant gentrification , in which affluent whites have moved into formerly non-white areas . In 2006 , the US Census Bureau estimated that non-Hispanic whites again formed a slight majority . But as of 2010 , in part due to the housing crash , as well as increased efforts to make more affordable housing more available , the minority population has rebounded . This may also have to do with an increased Latino population and more clarity surrounding US Census statistics , which indicate a Non-Hispanic White population of 47 percent ( some reports give slightly lower figures ) .
In 1896 , Patrick and Gilbert observed that during a prolonged period of sleep deprivation , sleepiness increases and decreases with a period of approximately 24 hours . In 1918 , J.S . Szymanski showed that animals are capable of maintaining 24-hour activity patterns in the absence of external cues such as light and changes in temperature . In the early 20th century , circadian rhythms were noticed in the rhythmic feeding times of bees . Extensive experiments were done by Auguste Forel , Ingeborg Beling , and Oskar Wahl to see whether this rhythm was due to an endogenous clock . [ citation needed ] Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer isolated the first clock mutant in Drosophila in the early 1970s and mapped the " period " gene , the first discovered genetic determinant of behavioral rhythmicity . Joseph Takahashi discovered the first mammalian circadian clock mutation ( clockΔ19 ) using mice in 1994 . However , recent studies show that deletion of clock does not lead to a behavioral phenotype ( the animals still have normal circadian rhythms ) , which questions its importance in rhythm generation .
Jethro Burns , best known as half of the comedy duo Homer and Jethro , was also the first important jazz mandolinist . Tiny Moore popularized the mandolin in Western swing music . He initially played an 8-string Gibson but switched after 1952 to a 5-string solidbody electric instrument built by Paul Bigsby . Modern players David Grisman , Sam Bush , and Mike Marshall , among others , have worked since the early 1970s to demonstrate the mandolin 's versatility for all styles of music . Chris Thile of California is a well-known player , and has accomplished many feats of traditional bluegrass , classical , contemporary pop and rock ; the band Nickel Creek featured his playing in its blend of traditional and pop styles , and he now plays in his band Punch Brothers . Most commonly associated with bluegrass , mandolin has been used a lot in country music over the years . Some well-known players include Marty Stuart , Vince Gill , and Ricky Skaggs .
The phrase " in whole or in part " has been subject to much discussion by scholars of international humanitarian law . The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia found in Prosecutor v. Radislav Krstic – Trial Chamber I – Judgment – IT-98-33 ( 2001 ) ICTY8 ( 2 August 2001 ) that Genocide had been committed . In Prosecutor v. Radislav Krstic – Appeals Chamber – Judgment – IT-98-33 ( 2004 ) ICTY 7 ( 19 April 2004 ) paragraphs 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 addressed the issue of in part and found that " the part must be a substantial part of that group . The aim of the Genocide Convention is to prevent the intentional destruction of entire human groups , and the part targeted must be significant enough to have an impact on the group as a whole . " The Appeals Chamber goes into details of other cases and the opinions of respected commentators on the Genocide Convention to explain how they came to this conclusion .
Although used in the Census and the American Community Survey , " Some other race " is not an official race , and the Bureau considered eliminating it prior to the 2000 Census . As the 2010 census form did not contain the question titled " Ancestry " found in prior censuses , there were campaigns to get non-Hispanic West Indian Americans , Turkish Americans , Armenian Americans , Arab Americans and Iranian Americans to indicate their ethnic or national background through the race question , specifically the " Some other race " category .
Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has criticized PS3 's high development costs and inferior attach rate and return to that of Xbox 360 and Wii . He believes these factors are pushing developers away from working on the console . In an interview with The Times Kotick stated " I 'm getting concerned about Sony ; the PlayStation 3 is losing a bit of momentum and they do n't make it easy for me to support the platform . " He continued , " It 's expensive to develop for the console , and the Wii and the Xbox are just selling better . Games generate a better return on invested capital ( ROIC ) on the Xbox than on the PlayStation . " Kotick also claimed that Activision Blizzard may stop supporting the system if the situation is not addressed . " [ Sony has ] to cut the [ PS3 's retail ] price , because if they do n't , the attach rates are likely to slow . If we are being realistic , we might have to stop supporting Sony . " Kotick received heavy criticism for the statement , notably from developer Bioware who questioned the wisdom of the threatened move , and referred to the statement as " silly . "
The 21 nocturnes are more structured , and of greater emotional depth , than those of Field ( whom Chopin met in 1833 ) . Many of the Chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression ( and often making very difficult demands on the performer ) which heightens their dramatic character .
Medicine : Findings from Neolithic graveyards in what is now Pakistan show evidence of proto-dentistry among an early farming culture . Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine that originated in ancient India before 2500 BC , and is now practiced as a form of alternative medicine in other parts of the world . Its most famous text is the Suśrutasamhitā of Suśruta , which is notable for describing procedures on various forms of surgery , including rhinoplasty , the repair of torn ear lobes , perineal lithotomy , cataract surgery , and several other excisions and other surgical procedures .
The migration of birds also aids the movement of other species , including those of ectoparasites such as ticks and lice , which in turn may carry micro-organisms including those of concern to human health . Due to the global spread of avian influenza , bird migration has been studied as a possible mechanism of disease transmission , but it has been found not to present a special risk ; import of pet and domestic birds is a greater threat . Some viruses that are maintained in birds without lethal effects , such as the West Nile Virus may however be spread by migrating birds . Birds may also have a role in the dispersal of propagules of plants and plankton .
The ability of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy , independent of Britain , was recognised at the 1923 Imperial Conference . Britain 's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa , and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne . After pressure from Ireland and South Africa , the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration , declaring the Dominions to be " autonomous Communities within the British Empire , equal in status , in no way subordinate one to another " within a " British Commonwealth of Nations " . This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster . The parliaments of Canada , Australia , New Zealand , the Union of South Africa , the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control , they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent . Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933 , suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression . Ireland distanced itself further from Britain with the introduction of a new constitution in 1937 , making it a republic in all but name .
In 1919 Nancy Astor was elected the first ever female member of parliament to take office in the British Houses of Parliament for the constituency of Plymouth Sutton . Taking over office from her husband Waldorf Astor , Lady Astor was a vibrantly active campaigner for her resident constituents . Plymouth was granted city status on 18 October 1928 . The city 's first Lord Mayor was appointed in 1935 and its boundaries further expanded in 1967 to include the town of Plympton and the parish of Plymstock .
Popper held that rationality is not restricted to the realm of empirical or scientific theories , but that it is merely a special case of the general method of criticism , the method of finding and eliminating contradictions in knowledge without ad-hoc-measures . According to this view , rational discussion about metaphysical ideas , about moral values and even about purposes is possible . Popper 's student W.W. Bartley III tried to radicalise this idea and made the controversial claim that not only can criticism go beyond empirical knowledge , but that everything can be rationally criticised .
Although the 1945–1949 expulsion of Germans from the northern part of former East Prussia was often conducted in a violent and aggressive way by Soviet officials , the present Russian inhabitants of the Kaliningrad Oblast have much less animosity towards Germans . German names have been revived in commercial Russian trade and there is sometimes talk of reverting Kaliningrad 's name to its historic name of Königsberg . The city centre of Kaliningrad was completely rebuilt , as British bombs in 1944 and the Soviet siege in 1945 had left it in nothing but ruins .
Some reordering of the Thuringian states occurred during the German Mediatisation from 1795 to 1814 , and the territory was included within the Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine organized in 1806 . The 1815 Congress of Vienna confirmed these changes and the Thuringian states ' inclusion in the German Confederation ; the Kingdom of Prussia also acquired some Thuringian territory and administered it within the Province of Saxony . The Thuringian duchies which became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany were Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach , Saxe-Meiningen , Saxe-Altenburg , Saxe-Coburg-Gotha , Schwarzburg-Sondershausen , Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and the two principalities of Reuss Elder Line and Reuss Younger Line . In 1920 , after World War I , these small states merged into one state , called Thuringia ; only Saxe-Coburg voted to join Bavaria instead . Weimar became the new capital of Thuringia . The coat of arms of this new state was simpler than they had been previously .
The Dutch Republic formally made claim to Saint Helena in 1633 , although there is no evidence that they ever occupied , colonised or fortified it . By 1651 , the Dutch had mainly abandoned the island in favour of their colony at the Cape of Good Hope .
Before A.D. 200 , residents were building earthwork mounds , which were used for ceremonial and religious purposes . Succeeding peoples , including those of the ancient Mississippian culture established by A.D. 1000 in the Piedmont , continued to build or add onto such mounds . In the 500–700 years preceding European contact , the Mississippian culture built large , complex cities and maintained far-flung regional trading networks . Historically documented tribes in the North Carolina region included the Carolina Algonquian-speaking tribes of the coastal areas , such as the Chowanoke , Roanoke , Pamlico , Machapunga , Coree , Cape Fear Indians , and others , who were the first to encounter the English ; Iroquoian-speaking Meherrin , Cherokee and Tuscarora of the interior ; and Southeastern Siouan tribes , such as the Cheraw , Waxhaw , Saponi , Waccamaw , and Catawba .

In politics , corruption undermines democracy and good governance by flouting or even subverting formal processes . Corruption in elections and in the legislature reduces accountability and distorts representation in policymaking ; corruption in the judiciary compromises the rule of law ; and corruption in public administration results in the inefficient provision of services . It violates a basic principle of republicanism regarding the centrality of civic virtue .
Orthodox Christianity includes a large number of traditions regarding the Ever Virgin Mary , the Theotokos . The Orthodox believe that she was and remained a virgin before and after Christ 's birth . The Theotokia ( i.e. , hymns to the Theotokos ) are an essential part of the Divine Services in the Eastern Church and their positioning within the liturgical sequence effectively places the Theotokos in the most prominent place after Christ . Within the Orthodox tradition , the order of the saints begins with : The Theotokos , Angels , Prophets , Apostles , Fathers , Martyrs , etc . giving the Virgin Mary precedence over the angels . She is also proclaimed as the " Lady of the Angels " .
Charlemagne 's court in Aachen was the centre of the cultural revival sometimes referred to as the " Carolingian Renaissance " . Literacy increased , as did development in the arts , architecture and jurisprudence , as well as liturgical and scriptural studies . The English monk Alcuin ( d. 804 ) was invited to Aachen and brought the education available in the monasteries of Northumbria . Charlemagne 's chancery—or writing office—made use of a new script today known as Carolingian minuscule , [ M ] allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe . Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy , imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains , as well as the Gregorian chant in liturgical music for the churches . An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying , correcting , and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics , with the aim of encouraging learning . New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced . Grammarians of the period modified the Latin language , changing it from the Classical Latin of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form to fit the needs of the church and government . By the reign of Charlemagne , the language had so diverged from the classical that it was later called Medieval Latin .
Theism generally holds that God exists realistically , objectively , and independently of human thought ; that God created and sustains everything ; that God is omnipotent and eternal ; and that God is personal and interacting with the universe through , for example , religious experience and the prayers of humans . Theism holds that God is both transcendent and immanent ; thus , God is simultaneously infinite and in some way present in the affairs of the world . Not all theists subscribe to all of these propositions , but each usually subscribes to some of them ( see , by way of comparison , family resemblance ) . Catholic theology holds that God is infinitely simple and is not involuntarily subject to time . Most theists hold that God is omnipotent , omniscient , and benevolent , although this belief raises questions about God 's responsibility for evil and suffering in the world . Some theists ascribe to God a self-conscious or purposeful limiting of omnipotence , omniscience , or benevolence . Open Theism , by contrast , asserts that , due to the nature of time , God 's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future . Theism is sometimes used to refer in general to any belief in a god or gods , i.e. , monotheism or polytheism .
At the end of November , Chopin returned to Paris . He passed the winter in unremitting illness , but gave occasional lessons and was visited by friends , including Delacroix and Franchomme . Occasionally he played , or accompanied the singing of Delfina Potocka , for his friends . During the summer of 1849 , his friends found him an apartment in Chaillot , out of the centre of the city , for which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer , Princess Obreskoff . Here in June 1849 he was visited by Jenny Lind .
However , an analysis by the Regional Data Cooperative for Greater New Haven , Inc. , has shown that due to issues of comparative denominators and other factors , such municipality-based rankings can be considered inaccurate . For example , two cities of identical population can cover widely differing land areas , making such analyses irrelevant . The research organization called for comparisons based on neighborhoods , blocks , or standard methodologies ( similar to those used by Brookings , DiversityData , and other established institutions ) , not based on municipalities .
The " soft " AC format has reinvented in the late 2000s/early 2010s as a result of its declining relevance , adopting a more upmarket , middle-of-the-road approach , with a selection of " oldies " ( usually from the 1960s/70s onwards ) , primarily rock , jazz , R & B and pop music . Newer songs are more often ( but not limited to ) " easy listening " fare , this amount varying depending on the age of the station 's target demographic .
Accurate present day child labour information is difficult to obtain because of disagreements between data sources as to what constitutes child labour . In some countries , government policy contributes to this difficulty . For example , the overall extent of child labour in China is unclear due to the government categorizing child labour data as “highly secret” . China has enacted regulations to prevent child labour ; still , the practice of child labour is reported to be a persistent problem within China , generally in agriculture and low-skill service sectors as well as small workshops and manufacturing enterprises . In 2014 , the U.S. Department of Labor issued a List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor where China was attributed 12 goods the majority of which were produced by both underage children and indentured labourers . The report listed electronics , garments , toys and coal among other goods .
Humans have shown extreme inventiveness in devising clothing solutions to environmental hazards . Examples include : space suits , air conditioned clothing , armor , diving suits , swimsuits , bee-keeper gear , motorcycle leathers , high-visibility clothing , and other pieces of protective clothing . Meanwhile , the distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut—since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider fashion in their design . Wearing clothes also has social implications . They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered , act as a form of adornment , and serve other social purposes .
The metal 's distinctive natural green patina has long been coveted by architects and designers . The final patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion , thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering . It can be a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts , depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain . Architectural copper and its alloys can also be 'finished ' to embark a particular look , feel , and/or color . Finishes include mechanical surface treatments , chemical coloring , and coatings .
Characters with diacritical marks can generally be represented either as a single precomposed character or as a decomposed sequence of a base letter plus one or more non-spacing marks . For example , ḗ ( precomposed e with macron and acute above ) and ḗ ( e followed by the combining macron above and combining acute above ) should be rendered identically , both appearing as an e with a macron and acute accent , but in practice , their appearance may vary depending upon what rendering engine and fonts are being used to display the characters . Similarly , underdots , as needed in the romanization of Indic , will often be placed incorrectly [ citation needed ] . Unicode characters that map to precomposed glyphs can be used in many cases , thus avoiding the problem , but where no precomposed character has been encoded the problem can often be solved by using a specialist Unicode font such as Charis SIL that uses Graphite , OpenType , or AAT technologies for advanced rendering features .
Neville Southall holds the record for the most Everton appearances , having played 751 first-team matches between 1981 and 1997 , and previously held the record for the most league clean sheets during a season ( 15 ) . During the 2008–09 season , this record was beaten by American goalkeeper Tim Howard ( 17 ) . The late centre half and former captain Brian Labone comes second , having played 534 times . The longest serving player is Goalkeeper Ted Sagar who played for 23 years between 1929 and 1953 , both sides of the Second World War , making a total of 495 appearances . The club 's top goalscorer , with 383 goals in all competitions , is Dixie Dean ; the second-highest goalscorer is Graeme Sharp with 159 . Dean still holds the English national record of most goals in a season , with 60 .
Given the potential consequences , engaging in sexual behavior is somewhat risky , particularly for adolescents . Having unprotected sex , using poor birth control methods ( e.g . withdrawal ) , having multiple sexual partners , and poor communication are some aspects of sexual behavior that increase individual and/or social risk . Some qualities of adolescents ' lives that are often correlated with risky sexual behavior include higher rates of experienced abuse , lower rates of parental support and monitoring . Adolescence is also commonly a time of questioning sexuality and gender . This may involve intimate experimentation with people identifying as the same gender as well as with people of differing genders . Such exploratory sexual behavior can be seen as similar to other aspects of identity , including the exploration of vocational , social , and leisure identity , all of which involve some risk .
During the board process an officer 's record is reviewed by a selection board at the Air Force Personnel Center at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio , Texas . At the 10 to 11 year mark , captains will take part in a selection board to major . If not selected , they will meet a follow-on board to determine if they will be allowed to remain in the Air Force . Promotion from major to lieutenant colonel is similar and occurs approximately between the thirteen year ( for officers who were promoted to major early " below the zone " ) and the fifteen year mark , where a certain percentage of majors will be selected below zone ( i.e. , " early " ) , in zone ( i.e. , " on time " ) or above zone ( i.e. , " late " ) for promotion to lieutenant colonel . This process will repeat at the 16 year mark ( for officers previously promoted early to major and lieutenant colonel ) to the 21 year mark for promotion to full colonel .
Among Peirce 's major contributions was to place inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning in a complementary rather than competitive mode , the latter of which had been the primary trend among the educated since David Hume wrote a century before . To this , Peirce added the concept of abductive reasoning . The combined three forms of reasoning serve as a primary conceptual foundation for the empirically based scientific method today . Peirce 's approach " presupposes that ( 1 ) the objects of knowledge are real things , ( 2 ) the characters ( properties ) of real things do not depend on our perceptions of them , and ( 3 ) everyone who has sufficient experience of real things will agree on the truth about them . According to Peirce 's doctrine of fallibilism , the conclusions of science are always tentative . The rationality of the scientific method does not depend on the certainty of its conclusions , but on its self-corrective character : by continued application of the method science can detect and correct its own mistakes , and thus eventually lead to the discovery of truth " .
If current trends continue , missiles will replace gun systems completely in " first line " service . [ citation needed ] Guns are being increasingly pushed into specialist roles , such as the Dutch Goalkeeper CIWS , which uses the GAU-8 Avenger 30 mm seven-barrel Gatling gun for last ditch anti-missile and anti-aircraft defence . Even this formerly front-line weapon is currently being replaced by new missile systems , such as the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile , which is smaller , faster , and allows for mid-flight course correction ( guidance ) to ensure a hit . To bridge the gap between guns and missiles , Russia in particular produces the Kashtan CIWS , which uses both guns and missiles for final defence . Two six-barrelled 30 mm Gsh-6-30 Gatling guns and 9M311 surface-to-air missiles provide for its defensive capabilities .
Nanjing first became a state capital in 229 AD , when the state of Eastern Wu founded by Sun Quan during the Three Kingdoms period relocated its capital to Jianye ( 建業 ) , the city extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in 211 AD . Although conquered by the Western Jin dynasty in 280 , Nanjing and its neighbouring areas had been well cultivated and developed into one of the commercial , cultural and political centers of China during the rule of East Wu . This city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries .
In a traditional village , the monastery is the centre of cultural life . Monks are venerated and supported by the lay people . A novitiation ceremony called shinbyu is the most important coming of age events for a boy , during which he enters the monastery for a short time . All male children in Buddhist families are encouraged to be a novice ( beginner for Buddhism ) before the age of twenty and to be a monk after the age of twenty . Girls have ear-piercing ceremonies ( နားသ ) at the same time . Burmese culture is most evident in villages where local festivals are held throughout the year , the most important being the pagoda festival . Many villages have a guardian nat , and superstition and taboos are commonplace .
The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue to clubs that are relegated from the league in the form of " parachute payments " . Starting with the 2013–14 season , these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons . Though designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues ( the average Premier League team receives £55 million while the average Football League Championship club receives £2 million ) , critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not , leading to the common occurrence of teams " bouncing back " soon after their relegation . For some clubs who have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League , financial problems , including in some cases administration or even liquidation have followed . Further relegations down the footballing ladder have ensued for several clubs unable to cope with the gap .
In 121 BC , Rome came into contact with two Celtic tribes ( from a region in modern France ) , both of which they defeated with apparent ease . The Cimbrian War ( 113–101 BC ) was a far more serious affair than the earlier clashes of 121 BC . The Germanic tribes of the Cimbri and the Teutons migrated from northern Europe into Rome 's northern territories , and clashed with Rome and her allies . At the Battle of Aquae Sextiae and the Battle of Vercellae both tribes were virtually annihilated , which ended the threat .
The Greek Cypriot population , meanwhile , had become hopeful that the British administration would lead to enosis . The idea of enosis was historically part of the Megali Idea , a greater political ambition of a Greek state encompassing the territories with Greek inhabitants in the former Ottoman Empire , including Cyprus and Asia Minor with a capital in Constantinople , and was actively pursued by the Cypriot Orthodox Church , which had its members educated in Greece . These religious officials , together with Greek military officers and professionals , some of whom still pursued the Megali Idea , would later found the guerrilla organisation Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston or National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters ( EOKA ) . The Greek Cypriots viewed the island as historically Greek and believed that union with Greece was a natural right . In the 1950s , the pursuit of enosis became a part of the Greek national policy ,
The remaining band members recorded " Independent Women Part I " , which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film , Charlie 's Angels . It became their best-charting single , topping the U.S . Billboard Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks . In early 2001 , while Destiny 's Child was completing their third album , Beyoncé landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film , Carmen : A Hip Hopera , starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer . Set in Philadelphia , the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet . When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001 , Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them . The album debuted at number one on the U.S . Billboard 200 , with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold . The album spawned other number-one hits , " Bootylicious " and the title track , " Survivor " , the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R & B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals . After releasing their holiday album 8 Days of Christmas in October 2001 , the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers .
During the First World War , to avoid ground fights between brothers , many Alsatians served as sailors in the Kaiserliche Marine and took part in the Naval mutinies that led to the abdication of the Kaiser in November 1918 , which left Alsace-Lorraine without a nominal head of state . The sailors returned home and tried to found a republic . While Jacques Peirotes , at this time deputy at the Landrat Elsass-Lothringen and just elected mayor of Strasbourg , proclaimed the forfeiture of the German Empire and the advent of the French Republic , a self-proclaimed government of Alsace-Lorraine declared independence as the " Republic of Alsace-Lorraine " . French troops entered Alsace less than two weeks later to quash the worker strikes and remove the newly established Soviets and revolutionaries from power . At the arrival of the French soldiers , many Alsatians and local Prussian/German administrators and bureaucrats cheered the re-establishment of order ( which can be seen and is described in detail in the reference video below ) . Although U.S. President Woodrow Wilson had insisted that the région was self-ruling by legal status , as its constitution had stated it was bound to the sole authority of the Kaiser and not to the German state , France tolerated no plebiscite , as granted by the League of Nations to some eastern German territories at this time , because Alsatians were considered by the French public as fellow Frenchmen liberated from German rule . Germany ceded the region to France under the Treaty of Versailles .
Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of " other cultures " , both in terms of time ( past societies ) and space ( non-European/non-Western societies ) . For example , the classic of urban anthropology , Ulf Hannerz in the introduction to his seminal Exploring the City : Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology mentions that the " Third World " had habitually received most of attention ; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in " other cultures " looked for them far away and started to look " across the tracks " only in late 1960s .
In editorials published on 29 and 31 July 1914 , Wickham Steed , the Times 's Chief Editor , argued that the British Empire should enter World War I . On 8 May 1920 , also under the editorship of Steed , The Times in an editorial endorsed the anti-Semitic fabrication The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion as a genuine document , and called Jews the world 's greatest danger . In the leader entitled " The Jewish Peril , a Disturbing Pamphlet : Call for Inquiry " , Steed wrote about The Protocols of the Elders of Zion :
In the early 1970s ( 1973 , to be particular ) when the military junta took over power in Uruguay , art suffered in Montevideo . The art studios went into protest mode , with Rimer Cardillo , one of the country 's leading artists , making the National Institute of Fine Arts , Montevideo a " hotbed of resistance " . This resulted in the military junta coming down heavily on artists by closing the Fine Art Institute and carting away all the presses and other studio equipment . Consequently , the learning of fine arts was only in private studios run by people who had been let out of jail , in works of printing and on paper and also painting and sculpture . It resumed much later .
A weather phenomenon known as the föhn ( with an identical effect to the chinook wind ) can occur at all times of the year and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind , bringing air of very low relative humidity to the north of the Alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the Alps . This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south . Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect . The driest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds lose a lot of their content while crossing the mountains before reaching these areas . Large alpine areas such as Graubünden remain drier than pre-alpine areas and as in the main valley of the Valais wine grapes are grown there .
Education in Nigeria is overseen by the Ministry of Education . Local authorities take responsibility for implementing policy for state-controlled public education and state schools at a regional level . The education system is divided into Kindergarten , primary education , secondary education and tertiary education . After the 1970s oil boom , tertiary education was improved so that it would reach every subregion of Nigeria . 68 % of the Nigerian population is literate , and the rate for men ( 75.7 % ) is higher than that for women ( 60.6 % ) .
Some findings in the fields of cosmology , evolutionary biology and neuroscience are interpreted by atheists ( including Lawrence M. Krauss and Sam Harris ) as evidence that God is an imaginary entity only , with no basis in reality . A single , omniscient God who is imagined to have created the universe and is particularly attentive to the lives of humans has been imagined , embellished and promulgated in a trans-generational manner . Richard Dawkins interprets various findings not only as a lack of evidence for the material existence of such a God but extensive evidence to the contrary .
Pope Paul VI became the first reigning pontiff ever to visit the Americas when he flew to New York in October 1965 to address the United Nations . As a gesture of goodwill , the pope gave to the UN two pieces of papal jewelry , a diamond cross and ring , with the hopes that the proceeds from their sale at auction would contribute to the UN 's efforts to end human suffering . During the pope 's visit , as the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War escalated under President Johnson , Paul VI pleaded for peace before the UN :
Abu el-Haj argues that genomics and the mapping of lineages and clusters liberates " the new racial science from the older one by disentangling ancestry from culture and capacity . " [ citation needed ] As an example , she refers to recent work by Hammer et al. , which aimed to test the claim that present-day Jews are more closely related to one another than to neighbouring non-Jewish populations . Hammer et al . found that the degree of genetic similarity among Jews shifted depending on the locus investigated , and suggested that this was the result of natural selection acting on particular loci . They focused on the non-recombining Y-chromosome to " circumvent some of the complications associated with selection " .
The principal official languages ( German , French , and Italian ) have terms , not used outside of Switzerland , known as Helvetisms . German Helvetisms are , roughly speaking , a large group of words typical of Swiss Standard German , which do not appear either in Standard German , nor in other German dialects . These include terms from Switzerland 's surrounding language cultures ( German Billette from French ) , from similar term in another language ( Italian azione used not only as act but also as discount from German Aktion ) . The French spoken in Switzerland has similar terms , which are equally known as Helvetisms . The most frequent characteristics of Helvetisms are in vocabulary , phrases , and pronunciation , but certain Helvetisms denote themselves as special in syntax and orthography likewise . Duden , one of the prescriptive sources for Standard German , is aware of about 3000 Helvetisms . Current French dictionaries , such as the Petit Larousse , include several hundred Helvetisms .
In the constituent legislature or convention , the conservative and liberal elements formed using the nicknames of Chirrines and Cuchas . The military entered as a third party . The elections for the first regular legislature were disputed , and it was not until May 1 , 1826 , that the body was installed . The liberals gained control and the opposition responded by fomenting a conspiracy . This was promptly stopped with the aid of informers , and more strenuous measures were taken against the conservatives . Extra powers were conferred on the Durango governor , Santiago Baca Ortiz , deputy to the first national congress , and leader of the liberal party .
Every fall the Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce hosts The Taste of Santa Monica on the Santa Monica Pier . Visitors can sample food and drinks from Santa Monica restaurants . Other annual events include the Business and Consumer Expo , Sustainable Quality Awards , Santa Monica Cares Health and Wellness Festival , and the State of the City . The swanky Shutters on the Beach Hotel offers a trip to the famous Santa Monica Farmers Market to select and influence the materials that will become that evening 's special " Market Dinner . "
Chopin 's public popularity as a virtuoso began to wane , as did the number of his pupils , and this , together with the political strife and instability of the time , caused him to struggle financially . In February 1848 , with the cellist Auguste Franchomme , he gave his last Paris concert , which included three movements of the Cello Sonata Op . 65 .
After secession , some North Carolinians refused to support the Confederacy . Some of the yeoman farmers in the state 's mountains and western Piedmont region remained neutral during the Civil War , while some covertly supported the Union cause during the conflict . Approximately 2,000 North Carolinians from western North Carolina enlisted in the Union Army and fought for the North in the war . Two additional Union Army regiments were raised in the coastal areas of the state , which were occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863 . Numerous slaves escaped to Union lines , where they became essentially free .
Kuaiji Commandery was the initial power base for Xiang Liang and Xiang Yu 's rebellion against the Qin Empire which initially succeeded in restoring the kingdom of Chu but eventually fell to the Han . Under the Later Han , control of the area returned to the settlement below Mount Kuaiji but authority over the Minyue hinterland was nominal at best and its Yue inhabitants largely retained their own political and social structures .
Drinking habits and the motives behind them often reflect certain aspects of an individual 's personality ; in fact , four dimensions of the Five-Factor Model of personality demonstrate associations with drinking motives ( all but 'Openness ' ) . Greater enhancement motives for alcohol consumption tend to reflect high levels of extraversion and sensation-seeking in individuals ; such enjoyment motivation often also indicates low conscientiousness , manifesting in lowered inhibition and a greater tendency towards aggression . On the other hand , drinking to cope with negative emotional states correlates strongly with high neuroticism and low agreeableness . Alcohol use as a negative emotion control mechanism often links with many other behavioral and emotional impairments , such as anxiety , depression , and low self-esteem .
According to one of her biographers , Giles St Aubyn , Victoria wrote an average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life . From July 1832 until just before her death , she kept a detailed journal , which eventually encompassed 122 volumes . After Victoria 's death , her youngest daughter , Princess Beatrice , was appointed her literary executor . Beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria 's accession onwards , and burned the originals in the process . Despite this destruction , much of the diaries still exist . In addition to Beatrice 's edited copy , Lord Esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them . Part of Victoria 's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by A. C. Benson , Hector Bolitho , George Earle Buckle , Lord Esher , Roger Fulford , and Richard Hough among others .
As a side effect of the electrochemical processes used by neurons for signaling , brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active . When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity , the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull , using electroencephalography ( EEG ) or magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) . EEG recordings , along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats , show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active , even during sleep . Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity , which may vary according to behavioral state . In mammals , the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep , faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive , and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task . During an epileptic seizure , the brain 's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels , producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain . Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology .
Windows Explorer , which has been renamed File Explorer , now includes a ribbon in place of the command bar . File operation dialog boxes have been updated to provide more detailed statistics , the ability to pause file transfers , and improvements in the ability to manage conflicts when copying files . A new " File History " function allows incremental revisions of files to be backed up to and restored from a secondary storage device , while Storage Spaces allows users to combine different sized hard disks into virtual drives and specify mirroring , parity , or no redundancy on a folder-by-folder basis .
Electroluminescence as a phenomenon was discovered in 1907 by the British experimenter H. J . Round of Marconi Labs , using a crystal of silicon carbide and a cat's-whisker detector . Soviet inventor Oleg Losev reported creation of the first LED in 1927 . His research was distributed in Soviet , German and British scientific journals , but no practical use was made of the discovery for several decades . Kurt Lehovec , Carl Accardo and Edward Jamgochian , explained these first light-emitting diodes in 1951 using an apparatus employing SiC crystals with a current source of battery or pulse generator and with a comparison to a variant , pure , crystal in 1953 .
Although sizable Orthodox Jewish communities are located throughout the United States , many American Orthodox Jews live in New York State , particularly in the New York City Metropolitan Area . Two of the main Orthodox communities in the United States are located in New York City and Rockland County . In New York City , the neighborhoods of Borough Park , Midwood , Williamsburg , and Crown Heights , located in the borough of Brooklyn , have particularly large Orthodox communities . The most rapidly growing community of American Orthodox Jews is located in Rockland County and the Hudson Valley of New York , including the communities of Monsey , Monroe , New Square , and Kiryas Joel . There are also sizable and rapidly growing Orthodox communities throughout New Jersey , particularly in Lakewood , Teaneck , Englewood , Passaic , and Fair Lawn .
By the mid 18th century , the movement broadened to incorporate a greater range of Classical influences , including those from Ancient Greece . The shift to neoclassical architecture is conventionally dated to the 1750s . It first gained influence in England and France ; in England , Sir William Hamilton 's excavations at Pompeii and other sites , the influence of the Grand Tour and the work of William Chambers and Robert Adam , was pivotal in this regard . In France , the movement was propelled by a generation of French art students trained in Rome , and was influenced by the writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann . The style was also adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia .
Many instruments originated during the Renaissance ; others were variations of , or improvements upon , instruments that had existed previously . Some have survived to the present day ; others have disappeared , only to be recreated in order to perform music of the period on authentic instruments . As in the modern day , instruments may be classified as brass , strings , percussion , and woodwind .
After Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , Beyoncé and Rowland founded the Survivor Foundation to provide transitional housing for victims in the Houston area , to which Beyoncé contributed an initial $ 250,000 . The foundation has since expanded to work with other charities in the city , and also provided relief following Hurricane Ike three years later .
In May and June 1835 , the area which is now central and northern Melbourne was explored by John Batman , a leading member of the Port Phillip Association in Van Diemen 's Land ( now known as Tasmania ) , who claimed to have negotiated a purchase of 600,000 acres ( 2,400 km2 ) with eight Wurundjeri elders . Batman selected a site on the northern bank of the Yarra River , declaring that " this will be the place for a village " . Batman then returned to Launceston in Tasmania . In early August 1835 a different group of settlers , including John Pascoe Fawkner , left Launceston on the ship Enterprize . Fawkner was forced to disembark at Georgetown , Tasmania , because of outstanding debts . The remainder of the party continued and arrived at the mouth of the Yarra River on 15 August 1835 . On 30 August 1835 the party disembarked and established a settlement at the site of the current Melbourne Immigration Museum . Batman and his group arrived on 2 September 1835 and the two groups ultimately agreed to share the settlement .
The young Feynman was heavily influenced by his father , who encouraged him to ask questions to challenge orthodox thinking , and who was always ready to teach Feynman something new . From his mother he gained the sense of humor that he had throughout his life . As a child , he had a talent for engineering , maintained an experimental laboratory in his home , and delighted in repairing radios . When he was in grade school , he created a home burglar alarm system while his parents were out for the day running errands .
In September 2005 , West announced that he would release his Pastelle Clothing line in spring 2006 , claiming " Now that I have a Grammy under my belt and Late Registration is finished , I am ready to launch my clothing line next spring . " The line was developed over the following four years – with multiple pieces teased by West himself – before the line was ultimately cancelled in 2009 . In 2009 , West collaborated with Nike to release his own shoe , the Air Yeezys , with a second version released in 2012 . In January 2009 , West introduced his first shoe line designed for Louis Vuitton during Paris Fashion Week . The line was released in summer 2009 . West has additionally designed shoewear for Bape and Italian shoemaker Giuseppe Zanotti .
Instruments have divided Christendom since their introduction into worship . They were considered a Catholic innovation , not widely practiced until the 18th century , and were opposed vigorously in worship by a number of Protestant Reformers , including Martin Luther ( 1483–1546 ) , Ulrich Zwingli , John Calvin ( 1509–1564 ) and John Wesley ( 1703–1791 ) . Alexander Campbell referred to the use of an instrument in worship as " a cow bell in a concert " . In Sir Walter Scott 's The Heart of Midlothian , the heroine , Jeanie Deans , a Scottish Presbyterian , writes to her father about the church situation she has found in England ( bold added ) :
Vacuum is useful in a variety of processes and devices . Its first widespread use was in the incandescent light bulb to protect the filament from chemical degradation . The chemical inertness produced by a vacuum is also useful for electron beam welding , cold welding , vacuum packing and vacuum frying . Ultra-high vacuum is used in the study of atomically clean substrates , as only a very good vacuum preserves atomic-scale clean surfaces for a reasonably long time ( on the order of minutes to days ) . High to ultra-high vacuum removes the obstruction of air , allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination . This is the principle behind chemical vapor deposition , physical vapor deposition , and dry etching which are essential to the fabrication of semiconductors and optical coatings , and to surface science . The reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of thermos bottles . Deep vacuum lowers the boiling point of liquids and promotes low temperature outgassing which is used in freeze drying , adhesive preparation , distillation , metallurgy , and process purging . The electrical properties of vacuum make electron microscopes and vacuum tubes possible , including cathode ray tubes . The elimination of air friction is useful for flywheel energy storage and ultracentrifuges .
The New York City Fire Department ( FDNY ) , provides fire protection , technical rescue , primary response to biological , chemical , and radioactive hazards , and emergency medical services for the five boroughs of New York City . The New York City Fire Department is the largest municipal fire department in the United States and the second largest in the world after the Tokyo Fire Department . The FDNY employs approximately 11,080 uniformed firefighters and over 3,300 uniformed EMTs and paramedics . The FDNY 's motto is New York 's Bravest .
Hesburgh is also credited with transforming the face of Notre Dame by making it a coeducational institution . In the mid-1960s Notre Dame and Saint Mary 's College developed a co-exchange program whereby several hundred students took classes not offered at their home institution , an arrangement that added undergraduate women to a campus that already had a few women in the graduate schools . After extensive debate , merging with St. Mary 's was rejected , primarily because of the differential in faculty qualifications and pay scales . " In American college education , " explained the Rev . Charles E. Sheedy , C.S.C. , Notre Dame 's Dean of Arts and Letters , " certain features formerly considered advantageous and enviable are now seen as anachronistic and out of place ... . In this environment of diversity , the integration of the sexes is a normal and expected aspect , replacing separatism . " Thomas Blantz , C.S.C. , Notre Dame 's Vice President of Student Affairs , added that coeducation " opened up a whole other pool of very bright students . " Two of the male residence halls were converted for the newly admitted female students that first year , while two others were converted for the next school year . In 1971 Mary Ann Proctor became the first female undergraduate ; she transferred from St. Mary 's College . In 1972 the first woman to graduate was Angela Sienko , who earned a bachelor 's degree in marketing .
Politically , the Marshall Islands is a presidential republic in free association with the United States , with the US providing defense , subsidies , and access to U.S. based agencies such as the FCC and the USPS . With few natural resources , the islands ' wealth is based on a service economy , as well as some fishing and agriculture ; aid from the United States represents a large percentage of the islands ' gross domestic product . The country uses the United States dollar as its currency .
At the age of 21 he settled in Paris . Thereafter , during the last 18 years of his life , he gave only some 30 public performances , preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon . He supported himself by selling his compositions and teaching piano , for which he was in high demand . Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries , including Robert Schumann . In 1835 he obtained French citizenship . After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska , from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer George Sand . A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838–39 was one of his most productive periods of composition . In his last years , he was financially supported by his admirer Jane Stirling , who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848 . Through most of his life , Chopin suffered from poor health . He died in Paris in 1849 , probably of tuberculosis .
Palermo ( Italian : [ paˈlɛrmo ] ( listen ) , Sicilian : Palermu , Latin : Panormus , from Greek : Πάνορμος , Panormos , Arabic : بَلَرْم‎ , Balarm ; Phoenician : זִיז , Ziz ) is a city in Insular Italy , the capital of both the autonomous region of Sicily and the Province of Palermo . The city is noted for its history , culture , architecture and gastronomy , playing an important role throughout much of its existence ; it is over 2,700 years old . Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily , right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea .
Anthropologists maintain that hunter/gatherers do n't have permanent leaders ; instead , the person taking the initiative at any one time depends on the task being performed . In addition to social and economic equality in hunter-gatherer societies , there is often , though not always , sexual parity as well . Hunter-gatherers are often grouped together based on kinship and band ( or tribe ) membership . Postmarital residence among hunter-gatherers tends to be matrilocal , at least initially . Young mothers can enjoy childcare support from their own mothers , who continue living nearby in the same camp . The systems of kinship and descent among human hunter-gatherers were relatively flexible , although there is evidence that early human kinship in general tended to be matrilineal .
The national capital of India , New Delhi is jointly administered by both the Central Government of India and the local Government of Delhi , it is also the capital of the National Capital Territory ( NCT ) of Delhi .
Some species of bacteria kill and then consume other microorganisms , these species are called predatory bacteria . These include organisms such as Myxococcus xanthus , which forms swarms of cells that kill and digest any bacteria they encounter . Other bacterial predators either attach to their prey in order to digest them and absorb nutrients , such as Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus , or invade another cell and multiply inside the cytosol , such as Daptobacter . These predatory bacteria are thought to have evolved from saprophages that consumed dead microorganisms , through adaptations that allowed them to entrap and kill other organisms .
In May 2013 , Microsoft launched a new television campaign for Windows 8 illustrating the capabilities and pricing of Windows 8 tablets in comparison to the iPad , which featured the voice of Siri remarking on the iPad 's limitations in a parody of Apple 's " Get a Mac " advertisements . On June 12 , 2013 during game 1 of the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals , Microsoft premiered the first ad in its " Windows Everywhere " campaign , which promoted Windows 8 , Windows Phone 8 , and the company 's suite of online services as an interconnected platform .
Nanjing is one of the most beautiful cities of mainland China with lush green parks , natural scenic lakes , small mountains , historical buildings and monuments , relics and much more , which attracts thousands of tourists every year .
The period known as the Crusades , a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the Levant back into Christian rule , began . Several Crusader states were founded in the eastern Mediterranean . These were all short-lived . The Crusaders would have a profound impact on many parts of Europe . Their Sack of Constantinople in 1204 brought an abrupt end to the Byzantine Empire . Though it would later be re-established , it would never recover its former glory . The Crusaders would establish trade routes that would develop into the Silk Road and open the way for the merchant republics of Genoa and Venice to become major economic powers . The Reconquista , a related movement , worked to reconquer Iberia for Christendom .
In the later Vedic Age , a number of small kingdoms or city states had covered the subcontinent , many mentioned in Vedic , early Buddhist and Jaina literature as far back as 500 BCE . sixteen monarchies and " republics " known as the Mahajanapadas—Kashi , Kosala , Anga , Magadha , Vajji ( or Vriji ) , Malla , Chedi , Vatsa ( or Vamsa ) , Kuru , Panchala , Matsya ( or Machcha ) , Shurasena , Assaka , Avanti , Gandhara , and Kamboja—stretched across the Indo-Gangetic Plain from modern-day Afghanistan to Bengal and Maharashtra . This period saw the second major rise of urbanism in India after the Indus Valley Civilisation .
Situated on one of the world 's largest natural harbors , New York City consists of five boroughs , each of which is a separate county of New York State . The five boroughs – Brooklyn , Queens , Manhattan , the Bronx , and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898 . With a census-estimated 2014 population of 8,491,079 distributed over a land area of just 305 square miles ( 790 km2 ) , New York is the most densely populated major city in the United States . As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York , making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world . By 2014 census estimates , the New York City metropolitan region remains by a significant margin the most populous in the United States , as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area ( 20.1 million residents ) and the Combined Statistical Area ( 23.6 million residents ) . In 2013 , the MSA produced a gross metropolitan product ( GMP ) of nearly US $ 1.39 trillion , while in 2012 , the CSA generated a GMP of over US $ 1.55 trillion , both ranking first nationally by a wide margin and behind the GDP of only twelve and eleven countries , respectively .
This view reveals a somewhat less than altruistic Christian intent of the British Empire ; however , it was paradoxical from the beginning , as Simpson and most other writers pointed out . The Ottomans were portrayed as the slavers , but even as the American and British fleets were striking at the Barbary pirates on behalf of freedom , their countries were promulgating a vigorous African slave trade of their own . Charles George Gordon is known as the saint of all British colonial officers . A dedicated Christian , he spent his time between assignments living among the poor and donating his salary on their behalf . He won Ottoman confidence as a junior officer in the Crimean War . In his later career he became a high official in the Ottoman Empire , working as Governor of Egypt for the Ottoman khedive for the purpose of conducting campaigns against slavers and slavery in Egypt and the Sudan .
The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 ( Swann report 1969 ) , and the EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003 . Moreover , several organizations ( e.g. , The American Society for Microbiology ( ASM ) , American Public Health Association ( APHA ) and the American Medical Association ( AMA ) ) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses . [ citation needed ] However , commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics , attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics , and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them . Two federal bills ( S.742 and H.R . 2562 ) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed , but have not passed . These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations , including the American Holistic Nurses ' Association , the American Medical Association , and the American Public Health Association ( APHA ) .
The finalists were Cook and Archuleta . David Cook was announced the winner on May 21 , 2008 , the first rocker to win the show . Both Cook and Archuleta had some success as recording artists with both selling over a million albums in the U.S .
Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter ( /biːˈjɒnseɪ/ bee-YON-say ) ( born September 4 , 1981 ) is an American singer , songwriter , record producer and actress . Born and raised in Houston , Texas , she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child , and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R & B girl-group Destiny 's Child . Managed by her father , Mathew Knowles , the group became one of the world 's best-selling girl groups of all time . Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé 's debut album , Dangerously in Love ( 2003 ) , which established her as a solo artist worldwide , earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles " Crazy in Love " and " Baby Boy " .
The unlicensed clone market has flourished following Nintendo 's discontinuation of the NES . Some of the more exotic of these resulting systems have gone beyond the functionality of the original hardware and have included variations such as a portable system with a color LCD ( e.g . PocketFami ) . Others have been produced with certain specialized markets in mind , such as an NES clone that functions as a rather primitive personal computer , which includes a keyboard and basic word processing software . These unauthorized clones have been helped by the invention of the so-called NES-on-a-chip .
The Central Bank of Liberia is responsible for printing and maintaining the Liberian dollar , which is the primary form of currency in Liberia . Liberia is one of the world 's poorest countries , with a formal employment rate of 15 % . GDP per capita peaked in 1980 at US $ 496 , when it was comparable to Egypt 's ( at the time ) . In 2011 , the country 's nominal GDP was US $ 1.154 billion , while nominal GDP per capita stood at US $ 297 , the third-lowest in the world . Historically , the Liberian economy has depended heavily on foreign aid , foreign direct investment and exports of natural resources such as iron ore , rubber and timber .

A . A. Luce and John Foster are other subjectivists . Luce , in Sense without Matter ( 1954 ) , attempts to bring Berkeley up to date by modernizing his vocabulary and putting the issues he faced in modern terms , and treats the Biblical account of matter and the psychology of perception and nature . Foster 's The Case for Idealism argues that the physical world is the logical creation of natural , non-logical constraints on human sense-experience . Foster 's latest defense of his views is in his book A World for Us : The Case for Phenomenalistic Idealism .
Greece : On March 24 , 2008 , the Olympic Flame was ignited at Olympia , Greece , site of the ancient Olympic Games . The actress Maria Nafpliotou , in the role of a High Priestess , ignited the torch of the first torchbearer , a silver medalist of the 2004 Summer Olympics in taekwondo Alexandros Nikolaidis from Greece , who handed the flame over to the second torchbearer , Olympic champion in women 's breaststroke Luo Xuejuan from China . Following the recent unrest in Tibet , three members of Reporters Without Borders , including Robert Ménard , breached security and attempted to disrupt a speech by Liu Qi , the head of Beijing 's Olympic organising committee during the torch lighting ceremony in Olympia , Greece . The People 's Republic of China called this a " disgraceful " attempt to sabotage the Olympics . On March 30 , 2008 in Athens , during ceremonies marking the handing over of the torch from Greek officials to organizers of the Beijing games , demonstrators shouted 'Free Tibet ' and unfurled banners ; some 10 of the 15 protesters were taken into police detention . After the hand-off , protests continued internationally , with particularly violent confrontations with police in Nepal .
When there is a potential difference across the conductors ( e.g. , when a capacitor is attached across a battery ) , an electric field develops across the dielectric , causing positive charge +Q to collect on one plate and negative charge −Q to collect on the other plate . If a battery has been attached to a capacitor for a sufficient amount of time , no current can flow through the capacitor . However , if a time-varying voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor , a displacement current can flow .
The 548 ft ( 167 m ) City Hall remained the tallest building in the city until 1987 when One Liberty Place was constructed . Numerous glass and granite skyscrapers were built in Philadelphia 's Center City from the late 1980s onwards . In 2007 , the Comcast Center surpassed One Liberty Place to become the city 's tallest building . The Comcast Innovation and Technology Center is under construction in Center City and is planned to reach a height of 1,121 feet ( 342 meters ) ; upon completion , the tower is expected to be the tallest skyscraper in the United States outside of New York City and Chicago .
Heritage buildings constructed during the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras showcase Indo-Islamic architecture influenced by Medieval , Mughal and European styles . After the 1908 flooding of the Musi River , the city was expanded and civic monuments constructed , particularly during the rule of Mir Osman Ali Khan ( the VIIth Nizam ) , whose patronage of architecture led to him being referred to as the maker of modern Hyderabad . In 2012 , the government of India declared Hyderabad the first " Best heritage city of India " .
The Alps provide lowland Europe with drinking water , irrigation , and hydroelectric power . Although the area is only about 11 percent of the surface area of Europe , the Alps provide up to 90 percent of water to lowland Europe , particularly to arid areas and during the summer months . Cities such as Milan depend on 80 percent of water from Alpine runoff . Water from the rivers is used in over 500 hydroelectricity power plants , generating as much as 2900 kilowatts of electricity .
Season seven premiered on January 15 , 2008 , for a two-day , four-hour premiere . The media focused on the professional status of the season seven contestants , the so-called 'ringers ' , many of whom , including Kristy Lee Cook , Brooke White , Michael Johns , and in particular Carly Smithson , had prior recording contracts . Contestant David Hernandez also attracted some attention due to his past employment as a stripper .
The government of India is based on a tiered system , in which the Constitution of India delineates the subjects on which each tier of government has executive powers . The Constitution originally provided for a two-tier system of government , the Union Government ( also known as the Central Government ) , representing the Union of India , and the State governments . Later , a third tier was added in the form of Panchayats and Municipalities . In the current arrangement , The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution delimits the subjects of each level of governmental jurisdiction , dividing them into three lists :
The New York City Public Schools system , managed by the New York City Department of Education , is the largest public school system in the United States , serving about 1.1 million students in more than 1,700 separate primary and secondary schools . The city 's public school system includes nine specialized high schools to serve academically and artistically gifted students .
The Low German varieties spoken in Germany are often counted among the German dialects . This reflects the modern situation where they are roofed by standard German . This is different from the situation in the Middle Ages when Low German had strong tendencies towards an ausbau language .
The modern pharmaceutical industry traces its roots to two sources . The first of these were local apothecaries that expanded from their traditional role distributing botanical drugs such as morphine and quinine to wholesale manufacture in the mid 1800s . Rational drug discovery from plants started particularly with the isolation of morphine , analgesic and sleep-inducing agent from opium , by the German apothecary assistant Friedrich Sertürner , who named the compound after the Greek god of dreams , Morpheus . Multinational corporations including Merck , Hoffman-La Roche , Burroughs-Wellcome ( now part of Glaxo Smith Kline ) , Abbott Laboratories , Eli Lilly and Upjohn ( now part of Pfizer ) began as local apothecary shops in the mid-1800s . By the late 1880s , German dye manufacturers had perfected the purification of individual organic compounds from coal tar and other mineral sources and had also established rudimentary methods in organic chemical synthesis . The development of synthetic chemical methods allowed scientists to systematically vary the structure of chemical substances , and growth in the emerging science of pharmacology expanded their ability to evaluate the biological effects of these structural changes .
In the May 23 season finale , Jordin Sparks was declared the winner with the runner-up being Blake Lewis . Sparks has had some success as a recording artist post-Idol .
Since the early 1950s on conventional carriers it has been the practice to recover aircraft at an angle to port of the axial line of the ship . The primary function of this angled deck is to allow aircraft that miss the arresting wires , referred to as a bolter , to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked forward . The angled deck allows the installation of one or two " waist " catapults in addition to the two bow cats . An angled deck also improves launch and recovery cycle flexibility with the option of simultaneous launching and recovery of aircraft .
Yale and New Haven are working to build a medical and biotechnology research hub in the city and Greater New Haven region , and are succeeding to some extent . [ citation needed ] The city , state and Yale together run Science Park , a large site three blocks northwest of Yale 's Science Hill campus . This multi-block site , approximately bordered by Mansfield Street , Division Street , and Shelton Avenue , is the former home of Winchester 's and Olin Corporation 's 45 large-scale factory buildings . Currently , sections of the site are large-scale parking lots or abandoned structures , but there is also a large remodeled and functioning area of buildings ( leased primarily by a private developer ) with numerous Yale employees , financial service and biotech companies .
The root system and the shoot system are interdependent – the usually nonphotosynthetic root system depends on the shoot system for food , and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system . Cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing adventitious shoots or roots . Stolons and tubers are examples of shoots that can grow roots . Roots that spread out close to the surface , such as those of willows , can produce shoots and ultimately new plants . In the event that one of the systems is lost , the other can often regrow it . In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf , as is the case with Saintpaulia , or even a single cell – which can dedifferentiate into a callus ( a mass of unspecialised cells ) that can grow into a new plant . In vascular plants , the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots . Roots are often adapted to store food such as sugars or starch , as in sugar beets and carrots .
Severe weather occurs regularly in North Carolina . On the average , a hurricane hits the state once a decade . Destructive hurricanes that have struck the state include Hurricane Fran , Hurricane Floyd , and Hurricane Hazel , the strongest storm to make landfall in the state , as a Category 4 in 1954 . Hurricane Isabel stands out as the most damaging of the 21st century . Tropical storms arrive every 3 or 4 years . In addition , many hurricanes and tropical storms graze the state . In some years , several hurricanes or tropical storms can directly strike the state or brush across the coastal areas . Only Florida and Louisiana are hit by hurricanes more often . Although many people believe that hurricanes menace only coastal areas , the rare hurricane which moves inland quickly enough can cause severe damage ; for example , in 1989 , Hurricane Hugo caused heavy damage in Charlotte and even as far inland as the Blue Ridge Mountains in the northwestern part of the state . On the average , North Carolina has 50 days of thunderstorm activity per year , with some storms becoming severe enough to produce hail , flash floods , and damaging winds .
In diffuse-porous woods , as has been stated , the vessels or pores are even-sized , so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in the earlywood . The effect of rate of growth is , therefore , not the same as in the ring-porous woods , approaching more nearly the conditions in the conifers . In general it may be stated that such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown . In many uses of wood , total strength is not the main consideration . If ease of working is prized , wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and straightness of grain , which will in most cases occur when there is little contrast between the latewood of one season 's growth and the earlywood of the next .
Like the reptiles , birds are primarily uricotelic , that is , their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine . Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and ( with exception of the ostrich ) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste . However , birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic , excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia . They also excrete creatine , rather than creatinine like mammals . This material , as well as the output of the intestines , emerges from the bird 's cloaca . The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening : waste is expelled through it , most birds mate by joining cloaca , and females lay eggs from it . In addition , many species of birds regurgitate pellets . Males within Palaeognathae ( with the exception of the kiwis ) , the Anseriformes ( with the exception of screamers ) , and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes ( but fully developed in Cracidae ) possess a penis , which is never present in Neoaves . The length is thought to be related to sperm competition . When not copulating , it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca , just inside the vent . The digestive system of birds is unique , with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth . Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight . Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies , including protein from the intestines , as additional energy during migration .
Unlike in higher animals , where parthenogenesis is rare , asexual reproduction may occur in plants by several different mechanisms . The formation of stem tubers in potato is one example . Particularly in arctic or alpine habitats , where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers by animals are rare , plantlets or bulbs , may develop instead of flowers , replacing sexual reproduction with asexual reproduction and giving rise to clonal populations genetically identical to the parent . This is one of several types of apomixis that occur in plants . Apomixis can also happen in a seed , producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent .
After Napoleon 's death , the thousands of temporary visitors were soon withdrawn and the East India Company resumed full control of Saint Helena . Between 1815 and 1830 , the EIC made available to the government of the island the packet schooner St Helena , which made multiple trips per year between the island and the Cape carrying passengers both ways , and supplies of wine and provisions back to the island .
These different explorations of 'identity ' demonstrate how difficult a concept it is to pin down . Since identity is a virtual thing , it is impossible to define it empirically . Discussions of identity use the term with different meanings , from fundamental and abiding sameness , to fluidity , contingency , negotiated and so on . Brubaker and Cooper note a tendency in many scholars to confuse identity as a category of practice and as a category of analysis ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 5 ) . Indeed , many scholars demonstrate a tendency to follow their own preconceptions of identity , following more or less the frameworks listed above , rather than taking into account the mechanisms by which the concept is crystallised as reality . In this environment , some analysts , such as Brubaker and Cooper , have suggested doing away with the concept completely ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 1 ) . Others , by contrast , have sought to introduce alternative concepts in an attempt to capture the dynamic and fluid qualities of human social self-expression . Hall ( 1992 , 1996 ) , for example , suggests treating identity as a process , to take into account the reality of diverse and ever-changing social experience . Some scholars have introduced the idea of identification , whereby identity is perceived as made up of different components that are 'identified ' and interpreted by individuals . The construction of an individual sense of self is achieved by personal choices regarding who and what to associate with . Such approaches are liberating in their recognition of the role of the individual in social interaction and the construction of identity .
In 2005 , the Office of Fair Trading found fifty independent schools , including Eton , to have breached the Competition Act by " regularly and systematically " exchanging information about planned increases in school fees , which was collated and distributed among the schools by the bursar at Sevenoaks School . Following the investigation by the OFT , each school was required to pay around £70,000 , totalling around £3.5 million , significantly less than the maximum possible fine . In addition , the schools together agreed to contribute another £3m to a new charitable educational fund . The incident raised concerns over whether the charitable status of independent schools such as Eton should be reconsidered , and perhaps revoked . However , Jean Scott , the head of the Independent Schools Council , said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business , were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other , and that they were unaware of the change to the law ( on which they had not been consulted ) . She wrote to John Vickers , the OFT director-general , saying , " They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer . They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed . "
Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s , including William Cullen Bryant , Washington Irving , Herman Melville , Rufus Wilmot Griswold , John Keese , Nathaniel Parker Willis , and Edgar Allan Poe . Public-minded members of the contemporaneous business elite lobbied for the establishment of Central Park , which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city .
Murdoch has responded to some of the arguments against the newspaper by saying that critics are " snobs " who want to " impose their tastes on everyone else " , while MacKenzie claims the same critics are people who , if they ever had a " popular idea " , would have to " go and lie down in a dark room for half an hour " . Both have pointed to the huge commercial success of the Sun in this period and its establishment as Britain 's top-selling newspaper , claiming that they are " giving the public what they want " . This conclusion is disputed by critics . John Pilger has said that a late-1970s edition of the Daily Mirror , which replaced the usual celebrity and domestic political news items with an entire issue devoted to his own front-line reporting of the genocide in Pol Pot 's Cambodia , not only outsold The Sun on the day it was issued but became the only edition of the Daily Mirror to ever sell every single copy issued throughout the country , something never achieved by The Sun .
South Korea : The event was held in Seoul , which hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics , on April 27 . Intended torchbearers Choi Seung-kook and Park Won-sun boycotted the event to protest against the Chinese government 's crackdown in Tibet . More than 8,000 riot police were deployed to guard the 24-kilometre route , which began at Olympic Park , which was built when Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games . On the day of the torch relay in Seoul , Chinese students clashed with protesters , throwing rocks , bottles , and punches . A North Korean defector whose brother defected to China but was captured and executed by the DPRK , attempted to set himself on fire in protest of China 's treatment of North Korean refugees . He poured gasoline on himself but police quickly surrounded him and carried him away . Two other demonstrators tried to storm the torch but failed . Fighting broke out near the beginning of the relay between a group of 500 Chinese supporters and approximately 50 protesters who carried a banner that read : " Free North Korean refugees in China . " The students threw stones and water bottles as approximately 2,500 police tried to keep the groups separated . Police said they arrested five people , including a Chinese student who was arrested for allegedly throwing rocks . Thousands of Chinese followed the torch on its 4.5 hour journey , some chanting , " Go China , go Olympics ! " By the end of the relay , Chinese students became violent , and it was reported in Korean media that they were " lynching " everyone who was disagreeing with them . One police man was also rushed to hospital after being attacked by Chinese students . On Apr 29 , the Secretary of Justice , Kim Kyung Han , told the prime minister that he will find " every single Chinese who was involved and bring them to justice . " Later in the day , South Korea 's Prosecutor 's Office , National Police Agency , Ministry of Foreign Affairs and National Intelligence Service made a joint statement saying that they will be deporting every Chinese student that was involved in the incident . China defended the conduct of the students .
On the Origin of Species , published on 24 November 1859 , is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology . Darwin 's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection . It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution . Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research , correspondence , and experimentation .
A language-independent alternative used in many countries is to hold up one 's two fists with the index knuckle of the left hand against the index knuckle of the right hand . Then , starting with January from the little knuckle of the left hand , count knuckle , space , knuckle , space through the months . A knuckle represents a month of 31 days , and a space represents a short month ( a 28- or 29-day February or any 30-day month ) . The junction between the hands is not counted , so the two index knuckles represent July and August .
The ethnogenesis of the Greek nation is linked to the development of Pan-Hellenism in the 8th century BC . According to some scholars , the foundational event was the Olympic Games in 776 BC , when the idea of a common Hellenism among the Greek tribes was first translated into a shared cultural experience and Hellenism was primarily a matter of common culture . The works of Homer ( i.e . Iliad and Odyssey ) and Hesiod ( i.e . Theogony ) were written in the 8th century BC , becoming the basis of the national religion , ethos , history and mythology . The Oracle of Apollo at Delphi was established in this period .
The city went through serious troubles in the mid-fourteenth century . On the one hand were the decimation of the population by the Black Death of 1348 and subsequent years of epidemics — and on the other , the series of wars and riots that followed . Among these were the War of the Union , a citizen revolt against the excesses of the monarchy , led by Valencia as the capital of the kingdom — and the war with Castile , which forced the hurried raising of a new wall to resist Castilian attacks in 1363 and 1364 . In these years the coexistence of the three communities that occupied the city—Christian , Jewish and Muslim — was quite contentious . The Jews who occupied the area around the waterfront had progressed economically and socially , and their quarter gradually expanded its boundaries at the expense of neighbouring parishes . Meanwhile , Muslims who remained in the city after the conquest were entrenched in a Moorish neighbourhood next to the present-day market Mosen Sorel . In 1391 an uncontrolled mob attacked the Jewish quarter , causing its virtual disappearance and leading to the forced conversion of its surviving members to Christianity . The Muslim quarter was attacked during a similar tumult among the populace in 1456 , but the consequences were minor .
Charles " Wag " Bennett , one of the judges at the 1966 competition , was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him . As Schwarzenegger had little money , Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate , London , England . Yorton 's leg definition had been judged superior , and Schwarzenegger , under a training program devised by Bennett , concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs . Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language . Also in 1966 , Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol Reg Park , who became his friend and mentor . The training paid off and , in 1967 , Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time , becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20 . He would go on to win the title a further three times . Schwarzenegger then flew back to Munich , training for four to six hours daily , attending business school and working in a health club ( Rolf Putziger 's gym where he worked and trained from 1966–1968 ) , returning in 1968 to London to win his next Mr. Universe title . He frequently told Roger C. Field , his English coach and friend in Munich at that time , " I 'm going to become the greatest actor ! "
The outreach director of HRTR , Susan Prager , is also the communication director of " Friends of Falun Gong " , a quasi-government non-profit funded by fmr . Congressman Tom Lanto 's wife and Ambassador Mark Palmer of NED . A major setback to the event was caused by footballer Diego Maradona , scheduled to open the relay through Buenos Aires , pulling out in an attempt to avoid the Olympic controversy . Trying to avoid the scenes that marred the relay in the UK , France and the US , the city government designed a complex security operative to protect the torch relay , involving 1200 police officers and 3000 other people , including public employees and volunteers . Overall , the protests were peaceful in nature , although there were a few incidents such as the throwing of several water balloons in an attempt to extinguish the Olympic flame , and minor scuffles between Olympic protesters and supporters from Chinese immigrant communities .
The war was successful for Great Britain , which gained the bulk of New France in North America , Spanish Florida , some individual Caribbean islands in the West Indies , the colony of Senegal on the West African coast , and superiority over the French trading outposts on the Indian subcontinent . The Native American tribes were excluded from the settlement ; a subsequent conflict , known as Pontiac 's War , was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status . In Europe , the war began disastrously for Prussia , but a combination of good luck and successful strategy saw King Frederick the Great manage to retrieve the Prussian position and retain the status quo ante bellum . Prussia emerged as a new European great power . The involvement of Portugal , Spain and Sweden did not return them to their former status as great powers . France was deprived of many of its colonies and had saddled itself with heavy war debts that its inefficient financial system could barely handle . Spain lost Florida but gained French Louisiana and regained control of its colonies , e.g. , Cuba and the Philippines , which had been captured by the British during the war . France and other European powers will soon avenge their defeat in 1778 when American Revolutionary War broke out , with hopes of destroying Britain 's dominance once and for all .
ASCII developed from telegraphic codes . Its first commercial use was as a seven-bit teleprinter code promoted by Bell data services . Work on the ASCII standard began on October 6 , 1960 , with the first meeting of the American Standards Association 's ( ASA ) X3.2 subcommittee . The first edition of the standard was published during 1963 , underwent a major revision during 1967 , and experienced its most recent update during 1986 . Compared to earlier telegraph codes , the proposed Bell code and ASCII were both ordered for more convenient sorting ( i.e. , alphabetization ) of lists , and added features for devices other than teleprinters .
Canadian defence policy today is based on the Canada First Defence Strategy , introduced in 2008 . Based on that strategy , the Canadian military is oriented and being equipped to carry out six core missions within Canada , in North America and globally . Specifically , the Canadian Armed Forces are tasked with having the capacity to :
On 23 April 2014 , the U.S. Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) was reported to be considering a new rule that will permit ISPs to offer content providers a faster track to send content , thus reversing their earlier net neutrality position . A possible solution to net neutrality concerns may be municipal broadband , according to Professor Susan Crawford , a legal and technology expert at Harvard Law School . On 15 May 2014 , the FCC decided to consider two options regarding Internet services : first , permit fast and slow broadband lanes , thereby compromising net neutrality ; and second , reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service , thereby preserving net neutrality . On 10 November 2014 , President Barack Obama recommended that the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality . On 16 January 2015 , Republicans presented legislation , in the form of a U.S. Congress H.R . discussion draft bill , that makes concessions to net neutrality but prohibits the FCC from accomplishing the goal or enacting any further regulation affecting Internet service providers . On 31 January 2015 , AP News reported that the FCC will present the notion of applying ( " with some caveats " ) Title II ( common carrier ) of the Communications Act of 1934 to the internet in a vote expected on 26 February 2015 . Adoption of this notion would reclassify internet service from one of information to one of the telecommunications and , according to Tom Wheeler , chairman of the FCC , ensure net neutrality . The FCC is expected to enforce net neutrality in its vote , according to the New York Times .
The roots of hard rock can be traced back to the 1950s , particularly electric blues , which laid the foundations for key elements such as a rough declamatory vocal style , heavy guitar riffs , string-bending blues-scale guitar solos , strong beat , thick riff-laden texture , and posturing performances . Electric blues guitarists began experimenting with hard rock elements such as driving rhythms , distorted guitar solos and power chords in the 1950s , evident in the work of Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis , Willie Johnson , and particularly Pat Hare , who captured a " grittier , nastier , more ferocious electric guitar sound " on records such as James Cotton 's " Cotton Crop Blues " ( 1954 ) . Other antecedents include Link Wray 's instrumental " Rumble " in 1958 , and the surf rock instrumentals of Dick Dale , such as " Let 's Go Trippin ' " ( 1961 ) and " Misirlou " ( 1962 ) .
Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots share a lot in common in their culture but also have differences . Several traditional food ( such as souvla and halloumi ) and beverages are similar , as well as expressions and ways of life . Hospitality and buying or offering food and drinks for guests or others are common among both . In both communities , music , dance and art are integral parts of social life and many artistic , verbal and nonverbal expressions , traditional dances such as tsifteteli , similarities in dance costumes and importance placed on social activities are shared between the communities . However , the two communities have distinct religions and religious cultures , with the Greek Cypriots traditionally being Greek Orthodox and Turkish Cypriots traditionally being Sunni Muslims , which has partly hindered cultural exchange . Greek Cypriots have influences from Greece and Christianity , while Turkish Cypriots have influences from Turkey and Islam .
The Air Commerce Act of May 20 , 1926 , is the cornerstone of the federal government 's regulation of civil aviation . This landmark legislation was passed at the urging of the aviation industry , whose leaders believed the airplane could not reach its full commercial potential without federal action to improve and maintain safety standards . The Act charged the Secretary of Commerce with fostering air commerce , issuing and enforcing air traffic rules , licensing pilots , certifying aircraft , establishing airways , and operating and maintaining aids to air navigation . The newly created Aeronautics Branch , operating under the Department of Commerce assumed primary responsibility for aviation oversight .
The dates are generalizations , since the periods and eras overlap and the categories are somewhat arbitrary , to the point that some authorities reverse terminologies and refer to a common practice " era " comprising baroque , classical , and romantic " periods " . For example , the use of counterpoint and fugue , which is considered characteristic of the Baroque era ( or period ) , was continued by Haydn , who is classified as typical of the Classical era . Beethoven , who is often described as a founder of the Romantic era , and Brahms , who is classified as Romantic , also used counterpoint and fugue , but other characteristics of their music define their era .
In 2004 , madaris were mainstreamed in 16 Regions nationwide , primarily in Muslim-majority areas in Mindanao under the auspices of the Department of Education ( DepEd ) . The DepEd adopted Department Order No . 51 , which instituted Arabic-language and Islamic Values instruction for Muslim children in state schools , and authorised implementation of the Standard Madrasa Curriculum ( SMC ) in private-run madaris . While there are state-recognised Islamic schools , such as Ibn Siena Integrated School in the Islamic City of Marawi , Sarang Bangun LC in Zamboanga and SMIE in Jolo , their Islamic studies programmes initially varied in application and content .
However , during this period , major figures and artists in the scene began leaning away from underground aesthetics . In the music press , the increasingly esoteric writing of post-punk publications soon began to alienate their readerships ; it is estimated that within several years , NME suffered the loss of half its circulation . Writers like Paul Morley began advocating " overground brightness " instead of the experimental sensibilities promoted in early years . Morley 's own musical collaboration with engineer Gary Langan and programmer J. J. Jeczalik , the Art of Noise , would attempt to bring sampled and electronic sounds to the pop mainstream . A variety of more pop-oriented groups , including ABC , the Associates , Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow ( the latter two managed by former Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren ) emerged in tandem with the development of the New Romantic subcultural scene . Emphasizing glamour , fashion , and escapism in distinction to the experimental seriousness of earlier post-punk groups , the club-oriented scene drew some suspicion from denizens of the movement .
Scholars disagree over the effects of social status on racial classifications in Brazil . It is generally believed that achieving upward mobility and education results in individuals being classified as a category of lighter skin . The popular claim is that in Brazil , poor whites are considered black and wealthy blacks are considered white . Some scholars disagree , arguing that " whitening " of one 's social status may be open to people of mixed race , a large part of the population known as pardo , but a person perceived as preto ( black ) will continue to be classified as black regardless of wealth or social status .
The placing of the nails in the hands , or the wrists is also uncertain . Some theories suggest that the Greek word cheir ( χειρ ) for hand includes the wrist and that the Romans were generally trained to place nails through Destot 's space ( between the capitate and lunate bones ) without fracturing any bones . Another theory suggests that the Greek word for hand also includes the forearm and that the nails were placed near the radius and ulna of the forearm . Ropes may have also been used to fasten the hands in addition to the use of nails .
Like most of southern California , the majority of San Diego 's current area was originally occupied by chaparral , a plant community made up mostly of drought-resistant shrubs . The endangered Torrey pine has the bulk of its population in San Diego in a stretch of protected chaparral along the coast . The steep and varied topography and proximity to the ocean create a number of different habitats within the city limits , including tidal marsh and canyons . The chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats in low elevations along the coast are prone to wildfire , and the rates of fire have increased in the 20th century , due primarily to fires starting near the borders of urban and wild areas .
On 15 September 1940 , known as the Battle of Britain Day , an RAF pilot , Ray Holmes of No . 504 Squadron RAF rammed a German bomber he believed was going to bomb the Palace . Holmes had run out of ammunition and made the quick decision to ram it . Holmes bailed out . Both aircraft crashed . In fact the Dornier Do 17 bomber was empty . It had already been damaged , two of its crew had been killed and the remainder bailed out . Its pilot , Feldwebel Robert Zehbe , landed , only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack . During the Dornier 's descent , it somehow unloaded its bombs , one of which hit the Palace . It then crashed into the forecourt of London Victoria station . The bomber 's engine was later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London . The British pilot became a King 's Messenger after the war , and died at the age of 90 in 2005 .
In July 2002 , Beyoncé continued her acting career playing Foxxy Cleopatra alongside Mike Myers in the comedy film , Austin Powers in Goldmember , which spent its first weekend atop the US box office and grossed $ 73 million . Beyoncé released " Work It Out " as the lead single from its soundtrack album which entered the top ten in the UK , Norway , and Belgium . In 2003 , Beyoncé starred opposite Cuba Gooding , Jr. , in the musical comedy The Fighting Temptations as Lilly , a single mother whom Gooding 's character falls in love with . The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed $ 30 million in the U.S. Beyoncé released " Fighting Temptation " as the lead single from the film 's soundtrack album , with Missy Elliott , MC Lyte , and Free which was also used to promote the film . Another of Beyoncé 's contributions to the soundtrack , " Summertime " , fared better on the US charts .
In the late 1990s and early 2000s , the IFAB experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout , which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match . These involved rules ending a game in extra time early , either when the first goal in extra time was scored ( golden goal ) , or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time ( silver goal ) . Golden goal was used at the World Cup in 1998 and 2002 . The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was France 's victory over Paraguay in 1998 . Germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition , beating Czech Republic in the final of Euro 1996 . Silver goal was used in Euro 2004 . Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB .
Primary ( or elementary ) education consists of the first five to seven years of formal , structured education . In general , primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six , although this varies between , and sometimes within , countries . Globally , around 89 % of children aged six to twelve are enrolled in primary education , and this proportion is rising . Under the Education For All programs driven by UNESCO , most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015 , and in many countries , it is compulsory . The division between primary and secondary education is somewhat arbitrary , but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age . Some education systems have separate middle schools , with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen . Schools that provide primary education , are mostly referred to as primary schools or elementary schools . Primary schools are often subdivided into infant schools and junior school .
The NES can be emulated on many other systems , most notably the PC . The first emulator was the Japanese-only Pasofami . It was soon followed by iNES , which was available in English and was cross-platform , in 1996 . It was described as being the first NES emulation software that could be used by a non-expert . NESticle , a popular MS-DOS emulator , was released on April 3 , 1997 . There have since been many other emulators . The Virtual Console for the Wii , Nintendo 3DS and Wii U also offers emulation of many NES games .
The Han dynasty was an age of economic prosperity and saw a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty ( c. 1050–256 BC ) . The coinage issued by the central government mint in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang dynasty ( 618–907 AD ) . The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations . To pay for its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories , the government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC , but these government monopolies were repealed during the Eastern Han period . Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances , including papermaking , the nautical steering rudder , the use of negative numbers in mathematics , the raised-relief map , the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere for astronomy , and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum .
The United Kingdom 's constitution , being uncodified and largely unwritten , makes no mention of a prime minister . Though it had de facto existed for centuries , its first mention in official state documents did not occur until the first decade of the twentieth century . Accordingly , it is often said " not to exist " , indeed there are several instances of parliament declaring this to be the case . The prime minister sits in the cabinet solely by virtue of occupying another office , either First Lord of the Treasury ( office in commission ) , or more rarely Chancellor of the Exchequer ( the last of whom was Balfour in 1905 ) .
The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when , in 1913 , Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore 's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni 's Lyme Park in Cheshire . This new , refaced principal façade ( of Portland stone ) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial , a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria , placed outside the main gates . George V , who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910 , had a more serious personality than his father ; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties . He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band ( 1919 ) – the first jazz performance for a head of state , Sidney Bechet , and Louis Armstrong ( 1932 ) , which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a ( Kind of ) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom . George V 's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts , and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art , both restoring and adding to it . Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed , such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy , dating from 1810 , which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room , the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade . Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room . This room , 69 feet ( 21 metres ) long , previously known as the South Drawing Room , has a ceiling designed specially by Nash , coffered with huge gilt console brackets .
North of the Historic Center , Azcapotzalco and Gustavo A. Madero have important industrial centers and neighborhoods that range from established middle-class colonias such as Claveria and Lindavista to huge low-income housing areas that share hillsides with adjacent municipalities in the State of Mexico . In recent years much of northern Mexico City 's industry has moved to nearby municipalities in the State of Mexico . Northwest of Mexico City itself is Ciudad Satélite , a vast middle to upper-middle-class residential and business area .
Medieval Cholas rose to prominence during the middle of the 9th century C.E . and established the greatest empire South India had seen . They successfully united the South India under their rule and through their naval strength extended their influence in the Southeast Asian countries such as Srivijaya . Under Rajaraja Chola I and his successors Rajendra Chola I , Rajadhiraja Chola , Virarajendra Chola and Kulothunga Chola I the dynasty became a military , economic and cultural power in South Asia and South-East Asia . Rajendra Chola I 's navies went even further , occupying the sea coasts from Burma to Vietnam , the Andaman and Nicobar Islands , the Lakshadweep ( Laccadive ) islands , Sumatra , and the Malay Peninsula in Southeast Asia and the Pegu islands . The power of the new empire was proclaimed to the eastern world by the expedition to the Ganges which Rajendra Chola I undertook and by the occupation of cities of the maritime empire of Srivijaya in Southeast Asia , as well as by the repeated embassies to China . They dominated the political affairs of Sri Lanka for over two centuries through repeated invasions and occupation . They also had continuing trade contacts with the Arabs in the west and with the Chinese empire in the east . Rajaraja Chola I and his equally distinguished son Rajendra Chola I gave political unity to the whole of Southern India and established the Chola Empire as a respected sea power . Under the Cholas , the South India reached new heights of excellence in art , religion and literature . In all of these spheres , the Chola period marked the culmination of movements that had begun in an earlier age under the Pallavas . Monumental architecture in the form of majestic temples and sculpture in stone and bronze reached a finesse never before achieved in India .
Since World War II , aircraft carrier designs have increased in size to accommodate a steady increase in aircraft size . The large , modern Nimitz class of US carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the World War II–era USS Enterprise , yet its complement of aircraft is roughly the same—a consequence of the steadily increasing size and weight of military aircraft over the years . Today 's aircraft carriers are so expensive that nations which operate them risk significant political , economic , and military impact if a carrier is lost , or even used in conflict .
As part of its education-related initiatives , the foundation has funded journalists , think tanks , lobbying organizations and governments . Millions of dollars of grants to news organizations have funded reporting on education and higher education , including more than $ 1.4 million to the Education Writers Association to fund training for journalists who cover education . While some critics have feared the foundation for directing the conversation on education or pushing its point of view through news coverage , the foundation has said it lists all its grants publicly and does not enforce any rules for content among its grantees , who have editorial independence . Union activists in Chicago have accused Gates Foundation grantee Teach Plus , which was founded by new teachers and advocates against seniority-based layoffs , of " astroturfing " .
Unicode defines two mapping methods : the Unicode Transformation Format ( UTF ) encodings , and the Universal Coded Character Set ( UCS ) encodings . An encoding maps ( possibly a subset of ) the range of Unicode code points to sequences of values in some fixed-size range , termed code values . The numbers in the names of the encodings indicate the number of bits per code value ( for UTF encodings ) or the number of bytes per code value ( for UCS encodings ) . UTF-8 and UTF-16 are probably the most commonly used encodings . UCS-2 is an obsolete subset of UTF-16 ; UCS-4 and UTF-32 are functionally equivalent .
Several recent movies have been filmed in New Haven , including Mona Lisa Smile ( 2003 ) , with Julia Roberts , The Life Before Her Eyes ( 2007 ) , with Uma Thurman , and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ( 2008 ) directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Harrison Ford , Cate Blanchett and Shia LaBeouf . The filming of Crystal Skull involved an extensive chase sequence through the streets of New Haven . Several downtown streets were closed to traffic and received a " makeover " to look like streets of 1957 , when the film is set . 500 locals were cast as extras for the film . In Everybody 's Fine ( 2009 ) , Robert De Niro has a close encounter in what is supposed to be the Denver train station ; the scene was filmed in New Haven 's Union Station .
Despite competition from other materials , copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring with the major exception being overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred . Copper wire is used in power generation , power transmission , power distribution , telecommunications , electronics circuitry , and countless types of electrical equipment . Electrical wiring is the most important market for the copper industry . This includes building wire , communications cable , power distribution cable , appliance wire , automotive wire and cable , and magnet wire . Roughly half of all copper mined is used to manufacture electrical wire and cable conductors . Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties , such as its high electrical conductivity , tensile strength , ductility , creep ( deformation ) resistance , corrosion resistance , low thermal expansion , high thermal conductivity , solderability , and ease of installation .
The University of Bath and Bath Spa University are higher education establishments in the north-east of the county . The University of Bath gained its Royal Charter in 1966 , although its origins go back to the Bristol Trade School ( founded 1856 ) and Bath School of Pharmacy ( founded 1907 ) . It has a purpose-built campus at Claverton on the outskirts of Bath , and has 15,000 students . Bath Spa University , which is based at Newton St Loe , achieved university status in 2005 , and has origins including the Bath Academy of Art ( founded 1898 ) , Bath Teacher Training College , and the Bath College of Higher Education . It has several campuses and 5,500 students .
In Suriname today , Dutch is the sole official language , and over 60 percent of the population speaks it as a mother tongue . Dutch is the obligatory medium of instruction in schools in Suriname , even for non-native speakers . A further twenty-four percent of the population speaks Dutch as a second language . Suriname gained its independence from the Netherlands in 1975 and has been an associate member of the Dutch Language Union since 2004 . The lingua franca of Suriname , however , is Sranan Tongo , spoken natively by about a fifth of the population .
Between 1963 and 1965 , there was a " downtown boom " that led to the construction of more than 700 buildings in the city . In 1968 , Virginia Commonwealth University was created by the merger of the Medical College of Virginia with the Richmond Professional Institute . In 1970 , Richmond 's borders expanded by an additional 27 square miles ( 70 km2 ) on the south . After several years of court cases in which Chesterfield County fought annexation , more than 47,000 people who once were Chesterfield County residents found themselves within the city 's perimeters on January 1 , 1970 . In 1996 , still-sore tensions arose amid controversy involved in placing a statue of African American Richmond native and tennis star Arthur Ashe to the famed series of statues of Confederate heroes of the Civil War on Monument Avenue . After several months of controversy , the bronze statue of Ashe was finally completed on Monument Avenue facing the opposite direction from the Confederate Heroes on July 10 , 1996 .
Although asthma is a chronic obstructive condition , it is not considered as a part of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as this term refers specifically to combinations of disease that are irreversible such as bronchiectasis , chronic bronchitis , and emphysema . Unlike these diseases , the airway obstruction in asthma is usually reversible ; however , if left untreated , the chronic inflammation from asthma can lead the lungs to become irreversibly obstructed due to airway remodeling . In contrast to emphysema , asthma affects the bronchi , not the alveoli .
Serbo-Croatian was standardized in the mid-19th-century Vienna Literary Agreement by Croatian and Serbian writers and philologists , decades before a Yugoslav state was established . From the very beginning , there were slightly different literary Serbian and Croatian standards , although both were based on the same Shtokavian subdialect , Eastern Herzegovinian . In the 20th century , Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia ( when it was called " Serbo-Croato-Slovenian " ) , and later as one of the official languages of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . The breakup of Yugoslavia affected language attitudes , so that social conceptions of the language separated on ethnic and political lines . Since the breakup of Yugoslavia , Bosnian has likewise been established as an official standard in Bosnia and Herzegovina , and there is an ongoing movement to codify a separate Montenegrin standard . Serbo-Croatian thus generally goes by the ethnic names Serbian , Croatian , Bosnian , and sometimes Montenegrin and Bunjevac .
The FA Cup winners qualify for the following season 's UEFA Europa League ( formerly named the UEFA Cup ; until 1998 they entered the Cup Winners ' Cup instead ) . This European place applies even if the team is relegated or is not in the English top flight . In the past , if the FA Cup winning team also qualified for the following season 's Champions League or Europa League through their league position , then the losing FA Cup finalist was given the Europa League place instead . FA Cup winners enter the Europa League at the group stage . Losing finalists , if they entered the Europa League , began earlier , at the play-off or third qualifying round stage . From the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League season , however , UEFA will not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition .
The civilians of London had an enormous role to play in the protection of their city . Many civilians who were unwilling or unable to join the military became members of the Home Guard , the Air Raid Precautions service ( ARP ) , the Auxiliary Fire Service , and many other organisations . The AFS had 138,000 personnel by July 1939 . Only one year earlier , there had only been 6,600 full-time and 13,800 part-time firemen in the entire country . During the Blitz , The Scout Association guided fire engines to where they were most needed , and became known as the " Blitz Scouts " . Many unemployed were drafted into the Royal Army Pay Corps . These personnel , along with others from the Pioneer Corps , were charged with the task of salvage and clean-up .
According to geologist Stefan Schmid , because the Western Alps underwent a metamorphic event in the Cenozoic Era while the Austroalpine peaks underwent an event in the Cretaceous Period , the two areas show distinct differences in nappe formations . Flysch deposits in the Southern Alps of Lombardy probably occurred in the Cretaceous or later .
In the 1920s and 1930s , air power theorists Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell espoused the idea that air forces could win wars by themselves , without a need for land and sea fighting . It was thought there was no defence against air attack , particularly at night . Enemy industry , their seats of government , factories and communications could be destroyed , effectively taking away their means to resist . It was also thought the bombing of residential centres would cause a collapse of civilian will , which might have led to the collapse of production and civil life . Democracies , where the populace was allowed to show overt disapproval of the ruling government , were thought particularly vulnerable . This thinking was prevalent in both the RAF and what was then known as the United States Army Air Corps ( USAAC ) between the two world wars . RAF Bomber Command 's policy in particular would attempt to achieve victory through the destruction of civilian will , communications and industry .
Newtown Creek , a 3.5-mile ( 6-kilometer ) a long estuary that forms part of the border between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens , has been designated a Superfund site for environmental clean-up and remediation of the waterway 's recreational and economic resources for many communities . One of the most heavily used bodies of water in the Port of New York and New Jersey , it had been one of the most contaminated industrial sites in the country , containing years of discarded toxins , an estimated 30 million US gallons ( 110,000 m3 ) of spilled oil , including the Greenpoint oil spill , raw sewage from New York City 's sewer system , and other accumulation .
Corey Clark was disqualified during the finals for having an undisclosed police record ; however , he later alleged that he and Paula Abdul had an affair while on the show and that this contributed to his expulsion . Clark also claimed that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show due to their affair . The allegations were dismissed by Fox after an independent investigation . Two semi-finalists were also disqualified that year – Jaered Andrews for an arrest on an assault charge , and Frenchie Davis for having previously modelled for an adult website .
The fluid in the coelomata contains coelomocyte cells that defend the animals against parasites and infections . In some species coelomocytes may also contain a respiratory pigment – red hemoglobin in some species , green chlorocruorin in others ( dissolved in the plasma ) – and provide oxygen transport within their segments . Respiratory pigment is also dissolved in the blood plasma . Species with well-developed septa generally also have blood vessels running all long their bodies above and below the gut , the upper one carrying blood forwards while the lower one carries it backwards . Networks of capillaries in the body wall and around the gut transfer blood between the main blood vessels and to parts of the segment that need oxygen and nutrients . Both of the major vessels , especially the upper one , can pump blood by contracting . In some annelids the forward end of the upper blood vessel is enlarged with muscles to form a heart , while in the forward ends of many earthworms some of the vessels that connect the upper and lower main vessels function as hearts . Species with poorly developed or no septa generally have no blood vessels and rely on the circulation within the coelom for delivering nutrients and oxygen .
Switzerland 's trade was blockaded by both the Allies and by the Axis . Economic cooperation and extension of credit to the Third Reich varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion and the availability of other trading partners . Concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through Vichy France was severed in 1942 , leaving Switzerland completely surrounded by the Axis . Over the course of the war , Switzerland interned over 300,000 refugees and the International Red Cross , based in Geneva , played an important part during the conflict . Strict immigration and asylum policies as well as the financial relationships with Nazi Germany raised controversy , but not until the end of the 20th century .
In the final decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer . The long military campaigns had forced citizens to leave their farms to fight , while their farms fell into disrepair . The landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices . As commodity prices fell , many farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit . The result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers . Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome , and thus into the ranks of the legislative assemblies . Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most . A new culture of dependency was emerging , in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief .
Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic , geographic and cultural scope . It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics , of which it is highly critical . Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of Anthropology , Bronislaw Malinowski , and his French compatriot , Marcel Mauss , on the nature of gift-giving exchange ( or reciprocity ) as an alternative to market exchange . Economic Anthropology remains , for the most part , focused upon exchange . The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production , in contrast . Economic Anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists , and have now turned to examine corporations , banks , and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective .
The early Islamic literature indicates that the conquest of India was one of the very early ambitions of the Muslims , though it was recognized as a particularly difficult one . After conquering Persia , the Arab Umayyad Caliphate incorporated parts of what are now Afghanistan and Pakistan around 720 . The book Chach Nama chronicles the Chacha Dynasty 's period , following the demise of the Rai Dynasty and the ascent of Chach of Alor to the throne , down to the Arab conquest by Muhammad bin Qasim in the early 8th century AD , by defeating the last Hindu monarch of Sindh , Raja Dahir .
This law is a fundamental principle of physics . As shown rigorously by Noether 's theorem , the conservation of energy is a mathematical consequence of translational symmetry of time , a property of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time coordinate . Put differently , yesterday , today , and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable . This is because energy is the quantity which is canonical conjugate to time . This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval . The uncertainty principle should not be confused with energy conservation - rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be defined and measured .
President Franklin Roosevelt ordered General Douglas MacArthur in the Philippines to formulate a Pacific defence plan with Australia in March 1942 . Curtin agreed to place Australian forces under the command of MacArthur who became Supreme Commander , South West Pacific . MacArthur moved his headquarters to Melbourne in March 1942 and American troops began massing in Australia . Enemy naval activity reached Sydney in late May 1942 , when Japanese midget submarines launched a daring raid on Sydney Harbour . On 8 June 1942 , two Japanese submarines briefly shelled Sydney 's eastern suburbs and the city of Newcastle .
On 30 September 1915 , troops of the Serbian Army observed three enemy aircraft approaching Kragujevac . Soldiers shot at them with shotguns and machine-guns but failed to prevent them from dropping 45 bombs over the city , hitting military installations , the railway station and many other , mostly civilian , targets in the city . During the bombing raid , private Radoje Ljutovac fired his cannon at the enemy aircraft and successfully shot one down . It crashed in the city and both pilots died from their injuries . The cannon Ljutovac used was not designed as an anti-aircraft gun , it was a slightly modified Turkish cannon captured during the First Balkan War in 1912 . This was the first occasion in military history that a military aircraft was shot down with ground-to-air fire .
According to this narrative , shortly after the birth of young prince Gautama , an astrologer named Asita visited the young prince 's father , Suddhodana , and prophesied that Siddhartha would either become a great king or renounce the material world to become a holy man , depending on whether he saw what life was like outside the palace walls .
In 2009 , IGN named the Xbox 360 the sixth-greatest video game console of all time , out of a field of 25 . Although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation , the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential , by emphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live , and by popularizing game achievement awards . PC Magazine considered the Xbox 360 the prototype for online gaming as it " proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space " . Five years after the Xbox 360 's original debut , the well-received Kinect motion capture camera was released , which set the record of being the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history , and extended the life of the console . Edge ranked Xbox 360 the second-best console of the 1993–2013 period , stating " It had its own social network , cross-game chat , new indie games every week , and the best version of just about every multiformat game ... Killzone is no Halo and nowadays Gran Turismo is no Forza , but it 's not about the exclusives—there 's nothing to trump Naughty Dog 's PS3 output , after all . Rather , it 's about the choices Microsoft made back in the original Xbox 's lifetime . The PC-like architecture meant those early EA Sports titles ran at 60fps compared to only 30 on PS3 , Xbox Live meant every dedicated player had an existing friends list , and Halo meant Microsoft had the killer next-generation exclusive . And when developers demo games on PC now they do it with a 360 pad—another industry benchmark , and a critical one . "
The Cork area has seen improvements in road infrastructure in recent years . For example , the Cork South Link dual carriageway was built in the early 1980s , to link the Kinsale Road roundabout with the city centre . Shortly afterwards , the first sections of the South Ring dual carriageway were opened . Work continued through the 1990s on extending the N25 South Ring Road , with the opening of the Jack Lynch Tunnel under the River Lee being a significant addition . The Kinsale Road flyover opened in August 2006 to remove a bottleneck for traffic heading to Cork Airport or Killarney . Other projects completed at this time include the N20 Blackpool bypass and the N20 Cork to Mallow road projects . The N22 Ballincollig dual carriageway bypass , which links to the Western end of the Cork Southern Ring road was opened in September 2004 . City Centre road improvements include the Patrick Street project - which reconstructed the street with a pedestrian focus . The M8 motorway links Cork with Dublin .
Beyoncé 's music is generally R & B , but she also incorporates pop , soul and funk into her songs . 4 demonstrated Beyoncé 's exploration of 90s-style R & B , as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases . While she almost exclusively releases English songs , Beyoncé recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable ( re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience ) , and the re-release of B'Day . To record these , Beyoncé was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez .
Emulation of the SNES is now available on handheld units , such as Android devices , Apple 's iPhone and iPad , Sony 's PlayStation Portable ( PSP ) , the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance , the Gizmondo , the Dingoo and the GP2X by GamePark Holdings , as well as PDAs . While individual games have been included with emulators on some GameCube discs , Nintendo 's Virtual Console service for the Wii marks the introduction of officially sanctioned general SNES emulation , though SNES9x GX , a port of SNES9x , has been made for the Wii .
Scientists associated with BYU have created some notable inventions . Philo T. Farnsworth , inventor of the electronic television , received his education at BYU , and later returned to do fusion research , receiving an honorary degree from the university . Harvey Fletcher , also an alumnus of BYU , inventor of stereophonic sound , went on to carry out the now famous oil-drop experiment with Robert Millikan , and was later Founding Dean of the BYU College of Engineering . H. Tracy Hall , inventor of the man-made diamond , left General Electric in 1955 and became a full professor of chemistry and Director of Research at BYU . While there , he invented a new type of diamond press , the tetrahedral press . In student achievements , BYU Ad Lab teams won both the 2007 and 2008 L'Oréal National Brandstorm Competition , and students developed the Magnetic Lasso algorithm found in Adobe Photoshop . In prestigious scholarships , BYU has produced 10 Rhodes Scholars , four Gates Scholars in the last six years , and in the last decade has claimed 41 Fulbright scholars and 3 Jack Kent Cooke scholars .
In March 2012 , the newspaper El Mundo published a story according to which FGV had instructed employees who were to testify at the crash commission investigation , providing a set of possible questions and guidelines to prepare the answers . In April 2013 , the television program Salvados questioned the official version of the incident as there were indications that the Valencian Government had tried to downplay the accident , which coincided with the visit of the pope to Valencia , or even to hide evidence , as the book of train breakdowns was never found . The day after the broadcast of this report , which received extensive media coverage , several voices called for the reopening of the investigation . The investigation was effectively reopened and the accident is currently under re-examination .
While he searched for enlightenment , Gautama combined the yoga practice of his teacher Kalama with what later became known as " the immeasurables " . [ dubious – discuss ] Gautama thus invented a new kind of human , one without egotism . [ dubious – discuss ] What Thich Nhat Hanh calls the " Four Immeasurable Minds " of love , compassion , joy , and equanimity [ full citation needed ] are also known as brahmaviharas , divine abodes , or simply as four immeasurables . [ web 5 ] Pema Chödrön calls them the " four limitless ones " . Of the four , mettā or loving-kindness meditation is perhaps the best known . [ web 5 ] The Four Immeasurables are taught as a form of meditation that cultivates " wholesome attitudes towards all sentient beings . " [ web 6 ] [ web 7 ]
Beginning roughly in the 14th century in Florence , and later spreading through Europe with the development of the printing press , a Renaissance of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology , with the Arabic texts and thought bringing about rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman knowledge .
As many Japanese had feared , Japan 's supply arrangements could not maintain her forces . Once Mutaguchi 's hopes for an early victory were thwarted , his troops , particularly those at Kohima , starved . During May , while Mutaguchi continued to order attacks , the Allies advanced southwards from Kohima and northwards from Imphal . The two Allied attacks met on 22 June , breaking the Japanese siege of Imphal . The Japanese finally broke off the operation on 3 July . They had lost over 50,000 troops , mainly to starvation and disease . This represented the worst defeat suffered by the Japanese Army to that date . [ citation needed ]
In some team matches , only one entrant from each team may be designated as the " legal " or " active " wrestler at any given moment . Two wrestlers must make physical contact ( typically palm-to-palm ) in order to transfer this legal status . This is known as a " tag " , with the participants " tagging out " and " tagging in " . Typically the wrestler who is tagging out has a 5-second count to leave the ring , whereas the one tagging in can enter the ring at any time , resulting in heels legally double-teaming a face .
Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology . Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them , while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among persons and groups . Cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy , literature and the arts ( how one 's culture affects experience for self and group , contributing to more complete understanding of the people 's knowledge , customs , and institutions ) , while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history . in that it helps develop understanding of social structures , typically of others and other populations ( such as minorities , subgroups , dissidents , etc. ) . There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them , and these categories overlap to a considerable degree .
From the late 18th century to the mid-19th century , large areas of India were annexed by the British East India Company of British Empire . Dissatisfaction with Company rule led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , after which the British provinces of India were directly administered by the British Crown and witnessed a period of both rapid development of infrastructure and economic stagnation . During the first half of the 20th century , a nationwide struggle for independence was launched with the leading party involved being the Indian National Congress which was later joined by other organizations . The subcontinent gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1947 , after the British provinces were partitioned into the dominions of India and Pakistan and the princely states all acceded to one of the new states .
The English name Switzerland is a compound containing Switzer , an obsolete term for the Swiss , which was in use during the 16th to 19th centuries . The English adjective Swiss is a loan from French Suisse , also in use since the 16th century . The name Switzer is from the Alemannic Schwiizer , in origin an inhabitant of Schwyz and its associated territory , one of the Waldstätten cantons which formed the nucleus of the Old Swiss Confederacy . The name originates as an exonym , applied pars pro toto to the troops of the Confederacy . The Swiss began to adopt the name for themselves after the Swabian War of 1499 , used alongside the term for " Confederates " , Eidgenossen ( literally : comrades by oath ) , used since the 14th century .
Unlike previous versions of Windows , Windows 8 was distributed at retail in " Upgrade " licenses only , which require an existing version of Windows to install . The " full version software " SKU , which was more expensive but could be installed on computers without an eligible OS or none at all , was discontinued . In lieu of full version , a specialized " System Builder " SKU was introduced . The " System Builder " SKU replaced the original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) SKU , which was only allowed to be used on PCs meant for resale , but added a " Personal Use License " exemption that officially allowed its purchase and personal use by users on homebuilt computers .
On 27 September , MacArthur received the top secret National Security Council Memorandum 81/1 from Truman reminding him that operations north of the 38th parallel were authorized only if " at the time of such operation there was no entry into North Korea by major Soviet or Chinese Communist forces , no announcements of intended entry , nor a threat to counter our operations militarily ... " On 29 September MacArthur restored the government of the Republic of Korea under Syngman Rhee . On 30 September , Defense Secretary George Marshall sent an eyes-only message to MacArthur : " We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of the 38th parallel . " During October , the ROK police executed people who were suspected to be sympathetic to North Korea , and similar massacres were carried out until early 1951 .
Chapter IV details natural selection under the " infinitely complex and close-fitting ... mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life " . Darwin takes as an example a country where a change in conditions led to extinction of some species , immigration of others and , where suitable variations occurred , descendants of some species became adapted to new conditions . He remarks that the artificial selection practised by animal breeders frequently produced sharp divergence in character between breeds , and suggests that natural selection might do the same , saying :
" By May 1539 , Conquistador Hernando de Soto skirted the coast of Florida , searching for a deep harbor to land . He described seeing a thick wall of red mangroves spread mile after mile , some reaching as high as 70 feet ( 21 m ) , with intertwined and elevated roots making landing difficult . Very soon , 'many smokes ' appeared 'along the whole coast ' , billowing against the sky , when the Native ancestors of the Seminole spotted the newcomers and spread the alarm by signal fires " . The Spanish introduced Christianity , cattle , horses , sheep , the Spanish language , and more to Florida . [ full citation needed ] Both the Spanish and French established settlements in Florida , with varying degrees of success . In 1559 , Don Tristán de Luna y Arellano established a colony at present-day Pensacola , one of the first European settlements in the continental United States , but it was abandoned by 1561 .
Shiraz , with a population of around 1.4 million ( 2011 census ) , is the sixth major city of Iran . It is the capital of Fars Province , and was also a former capital of Iran . The area was greatly influenced by the Babylonian civilization , and after the emergence of the ancient Persians , soon came to be known as Persis . Persians were present in the region since the 9th century BC , and became rulers of a large empire under the reign of the Achaemenid Dynasty in the 6th century BC . The ruins of Persepolis and Pasargadae , two of the four capitals of the Achaemenid Empire , are located around the modern-day city of Shiraz .
The Qur'an relates detailed narrative accounts of Maryam ( Mary ) in two places , Qur'an 3:35–47 and 19:16–34 . These state beliefs in both the Immaculate Conception of Mary and the Virgin birth of Jesus . The account given in Sura 19 is nearly identical with that in the Gospel according to Luke , and both of these ( Luke , Sura 19 ) begin with an account of the visitation of an angel upon Zakariya ( Zecharias ) and Good News of the birth of Yahya ( John ) , followed by the account of the annunciation . It mentions how Mary was informed by an angel that she would become the mother of Jesus through the actions of God alone .
A team led by Enrico Fermi in 1934 observed that bombarding uranium with neutrons produces the emission of beta rays ( electrons or positrons from the elements produced ; see beta particle ) . The fission products were at first mistaken for new elements of atomic numbers 93 and 94 , which the Dean of the Faculty of Rome , Orso Mario Corbino , christened ausonium and hesperium , respectively . The experiments leading to the discovery of uranium 's ability to fission ( break apart ) into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in Hahn 's laboratory in Berlin . Lise Meitner and her nephew , the physicist Otto Robert Frisch , published the physical explanation in February 1939 and named the process " nuclear fission " . Soon after , Fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction . Confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939 , and later work found that on average about 2.5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium-235 . Further work found that the far more common uranium-238 isotope can be transmuted into plutonium , which , like uranium-235 , is also fissile by thermal neutrons . These discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear power .
Hellenistic military equipment was generally characterized by an increase in size . Hellenistic-era warships grew from the trireme to include more banks of oars and larger numbers of rowers and soldiers as in the Quadrireme and Quinquereme . The Ptolemaic Tessarakonteres was the largest ship constructed in Antiquity . New siege engines were developed during this period . An unknown engineer developed the torsion-spring catapult ( ca . 360 ) and Dionysios of Alexandria designed a repeating ballista , the Polybolos . Preserved examples of ball projectiles range from 4.4 kg to 78 kg ( or over 170 lbs ) . Demetrius Poliorcetes was notorious for the large siege engines employed in his campaigns , especially during the 12-month siege of Rhodes when he had Epimachos of Athens build a massive 160 ton siege tower named Helepolis , filled with artillery .
Montana has been a destination for its world-class trout fisheries since the 1930s . Fly fishing for several species of native and introduced trout in rivers and lakes is popular for both residents and tourists throughout the state . Montana is the home of the Federation of Fly Fishers and hosts many of the organizations annual conclaves . The state has robust recreational lake trout and kokanee salmon fisheries in the west , walleye can be found in many parts of the state , while northern pike , smallmouth and largemouth bass fisheries as well as catfish and paddlefish can be found in the waters of eastern Montana . Robert Redford 's 1992 film of Norman Mclean 's novel , A River Runs Through It , was filmed in Montana and brought national attention to fly fishing and the state .
In the United States , federalism originally referred to belief in a stronger central government . When the U.S. Constitution was being drafted , the Federalist Party supported a stronger central government , while " Anti-Federalists " wanted a weaker central government . This is very different from the modern usage of " federalism " in Europe and the United States . The distinction stems from the fact that " federalism " is situated in the middle of the political spectrum between a confederacy and a unitary state . The U.S. Constitution was written as a reaction to the Articles of Confederation , under which the United States was a loose confederation with a weak central government .
Though based upon Mahayana , Tibeto-Mongolian Buddhism is one of the schools that practice Vajrayana or " Diamond Vehicle " ( also referred to as Mantrayāna , Tantrayāna , Tantric Buddhism , or esoteric Buddhism ) . It accepts all the basic concepts of Mahāyāna , but also includes a vast array of spiritual and physical techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice . Tantric Buddhism is largely concerned with ritual and meditative practices . One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy through ritual , visualization , physical exercises , and meditation as a means of developing the mind . Using these techniques , it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime , or even as little as three years . In the Tibetan tradition , these practices can include sexual yoga , though only for some very advanced practitioners .
In several nations , rulers welcomed leaders of the Enlightenment at court and asked them to help design laws and programs to reform the system , typically to build stronger national states . These rulers are called " enlightened despots " by historians . They included Frederick the Great of Prussia , Catherine the Great of Russia , Leopold II of Tuscany , and Joseph II of Austria . Joseph was over-enthusiastic , announcing so many reforms that had so little support that revolts broke out and his regime became a comedy of errors and nearly all his programs were reversed . Senior ministers Pombal in Portugal and Struensee in Denmark also governed according to Enlightenment ideals . In Poland , the model constitution of 1791 expressed Enlightenment ideals , but was in effect for only one year as the nation was partitioned among its neighbors . More enduring were the cultural achievements , which created a nationalist spirit in Poland .
A study from the Mediterranean Migration Observatory maintains that the 2001 census recorded 762,191 persons residing in Greece without Greek citizenship , constituting around 7 % of total population . Of the non-citizen residents , 48,560 were EU or European Free Trade Association nationals and 17,426 were Cypriots with privileged status . The majority come from Eastern European countries : Albania ( 56 % ) , Bulgaria ( 5 % ) and Romania ( 3 % ) , while migrants from the former Soviet Union ( Georgia , Russia , Ukraine , Moldova , etc . ) comprise 10 % of the total . Some of the immigrants from Albania are from the Greek minority in Albania centred on the region of Northern Epirus . In addition the total Albanian national population which includes temporary migrants and undocumented persons is around 600,000 .
A combined UN civilian and peace-keeping force called UNTAG ( United Nations Transition Assistance Group ) under Finnish diplomat Martti Ahtisaari was deployed from April 1989 to March 1990 to monitor the peace process , elections and supervise military withdrawals . As UNTAG began to deploy peacekeepers , military observers , police , and political workers , hostilities were briefly renewed on the day the transition process was supposed to begin . After a new round of negotiations , a second date was set and the elections process began in earnest . After the return of SWAPO exiles ( over 46,000 exiles ) , Namibia 's first one-person one-vote elections for the constitutional assembly took place in November 1989 . The official election slogan was " Free and Fair Elections " . This was won by SWAPO although it did not gain the two-thirds majority it had hoped for ; the South African-backed Democratic Turnhalle Alliance ( DTA ) became the official opposition . The elections were peaceful and declared free and fair .
Tito 's estrangement from the USSR enabled Yugoslavia to obtain US aid via the Economic Cooperation Administration ( ECA ) , the same US aid institution which administered the Marshall Plan . Still , he did not agree to align with the West , which was a common consequence of accepting American aid at the time . After Stalin 's death in 1953 , relations with the USSR were relaxed and he began to receive aid as well from the COMECON . In this way , Tito played East-West antagonism to his advantage . Instead of choosing sides , he was instrumental in kick-starting the Non-Aligned Movement , which would function as a 'third way ' for countries interested in staying outside of the East-West divide .
A party may claim that a treaty should be terminated , even absent an express provision , if there has been a fundamental change in circumstances . Such a change is sufficient if unforeseen , if it undermined the “essential basis” of consent by a party , if it radically transforms the extent of obligations between the parties , and if the obligations are still to be performed . A party can not base this claim on change brought about by its own breach of the treaty . This claim also can not be used to invalidate treaties that established or redrew political boundaries .

Increasing military and cultural contacts with the Muslim world , including the Norman conquest of Islamic Sicily in 1090 , the Crusades , beginning 1096 , and the Islamic presence in Spain , may have influenced Medieval Europe 's adoption of the pointed arch , although this hypothesis remains controversial . Certainly , in those parts of the Western Mediterranean subject to Islamic control or influence , rich regional variants arose , fusing Romanesque and later Gothic traditions with Islamic decorative forms , as seen , for example , in Monreale and Cefalù Cathedrals , the Alcázar of Seville , and Teruel Cathedral .
After back-to-back pennants in 1880 and 1881 , Hulbert died , and Spalding , who had retired to start Spalding sporting goods , assumed ownership of the club . The White Stockings , with Anson acting as player/manager , captured their third consecutive pennant in 1882 , and Anson established himself as the game 's first true superstar . In 1885 and '86 , after winning N.L . pennants , the White Stockings met the short-lived American Association champion in that era 's version of a World Series . Both seasons resulted in match ups with the St. Louis Brown Stockings , with the clubs tying in 1885 and with St. Louis winning in 1886 . This was the genesis of what would eventually become one of the greatest rivalries in sports . In all , the Anson-led Chicago Base Ball Club won six National League pennants between 1876 and 1886 . As a result , Chicago 's club nickname transitioned , and by 1890 they had become known as the Chicago Colts , or sometimes " Anson 's Colts " , referring to Cap 's influence within the club . Anson was the first player in history credited with collecting 3,000 career hits . After a disappointing record of 59-73 and a 9th-place finish in 1897 , Anson was released by the Cubs as both a player and manager . Due to Anson 's absence from the club after 22 years , local newspaper reporters started to refer to the Cubs as the " Orphans " .
Elementary and secondary public schools are overseen by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction . The North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction is the secretary of the North Carolina State Board of Education , but the board , rather than the superintendent , holds most of the legal authority for making public education policy . In 2009 , the board 's chairman also became the " chief executive officer " for the state 's school system . North Carolina has 115 public school systems , each of which is overseen by a local school board . A county may have one or more systems within it . The largest school systems in North Carolina are the Wake County Public School System , Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools , Guilford County Schools , Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools , and Cumberland County Schools . In total there are 2,425 public schools in the state , including 99 charter schools . North Carolina Schools were segregated until the Brown v. Board of Education trial and the release of the Pearsall Plan .
The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s , for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data . If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement , the former must be at least deducible from the latter . But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement . Remember that the translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation . There is , however , no finite set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer . According to phenomenalism , to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer , the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal . But , of course , the doctor himself must be a normal observer . If we are to specify this doctor 's normality in sensory terms , we must make reference to a second doctor who , when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor , would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer . And if we are to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer , we must refer to a third doctor , and so on ( also see the third man ) .
In the controversial elections in 2002 , Sassou won with almost 90 % of the vote cast . His two main rivals , Lissouba and Bernard Kolelas , were prevented from competing and the only remaining credible rival , Andre Milongo , advised his supporters to boycott the elections and then withdrew from the race . A new constitution , agreed upon by referendum in January 2002 , granted the president new powers , extended his term to seven years , and introduced a new bicameral assembly . International observers took issue with the organization of the presidential election and the constitutional referendum , both of which were reminiscent in their organization of Congo 's era of the one-party state . Following the presidential elections , fighting restarted in the Pool region between government forces and rebels led by Pastor Ntumi ; a peace treaty to end the conflict was signed in April 2003 .
DST is generally not observed near the equator , where sunrise times do not vary enough to justify it . Some countries observe it only in some regions ; for example , southern Brazil observes it while equatorial Brazil does not . Only a minority of the world 's population uses DST because Asia and Africa generally do not observe it .
In the aftermath , all power was transferred from the East India Company to the British Crown , which began to administer most of India as a number of provinces . The Crown controlled the Company 's lands directly and had considerable indirect influence over the rest of India , which consisted of the Princely states ruled by local royal families . There were officially 565 princely states in 1947 , but only 21 had actual state governments , and only three were large ( Mysore , Hyderabad and Kashmir ) . They were absorbed into the independent nation in 1947–48 .
Other notable places include Elizabeth Fort , the Cork Opera House , Christ Church on South Main Street ( now the Triskel Arts Centre and original site of early Hiberno-Norse church ) , St Mary 's Dominican Church on Popes Quay and Fitzgerald 's Park to the west of the city , which contains the Cork Public Museum . Other popular tourist attractions include the grounds of University College Cork , through which the River Lee flows , the Women 's Gaol at Sundays Well ( now a heritage centre ) and the English Market . This covered market traces its origins back to 1610 , and the present building dates from 1786 .
Between 1836 and 1842 Victorian Aboriginal groups were largely dispossessed [ by whom ? ] of their land . By January 1844 , there were said to be 675 Aborigines resident in squalid camps in Melbourne . The British Colonial Office appointed five Aboriginal Protectors for the Aborigines of Victoria , in 1839 , however their work was nullified by a land policy that favoured squatters to take possession of Aboriginal lands . By 1845 , fewer than 240 wealthy Europeans held all the pastoral licences then issued in Victoria and became a powerful political and economic force in Victoria for generations to come .
The Jesuit China missions of the 16th and 17th centuries " learned to appreciate the scientific achievements of this ancient culture and made them known in Europe . Through their correspondence European scientists first learned about the Chinese science and culture . " Western academic thought on the history of Chinese technology and science was galvanized by the work of Joseph Needham and the Needham Research Institute . Among the technological accomplishments of China were , according to the British scholar Needham , early seismological detectors ( Zhang Heng in the 2nd century ) , the water-powered celestial globe ( Zhang Heng ) , matches , the independent invention of the decimal system , dry docks , sliding calipers , the double-action piston pump , cast iron , the blast furnace , the iron plough , the multi-tube seed drill , the wheelbarrow , the suspension bridge , the winnowing machine , the rotary fan , the parachute , natural gas as fuel , the raised-relief map , the propeller , the crossbow , and a solid fuel rocket , the multistage rocket , the horse collar , along with contributions in logic , astronomy , medicine , and other fields .
In a course at the LSA summer institute in 1991 , Alan Prince and Paul Smolensky developed optimality theory—an overall architecture for phonology according to which languages choose a pronunciation of a word that best satisfies a list of constraints ordered by importance ; a lower-ranked constraint can be violated when the violation is necessary in order to obey a higher-ranked constraint . The approach was soon extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince , and has become a dominant trend in phonology . The appeal to phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements ( e.g . features ) in various approaches has been criticized by proponents of 'substance-free phonology ' , especially Mark Hale and Charles Reiss .
Human interference has nearly exterminated the trees in many areas , and , except for the beech forests of the Austrian Alps , forests of deciduous trees are rarely found after the extreme deforestation between the 17th and 19th centuries . The vegetation has changed since the second half of the 20th century , as the high alpine meadows cease to be harvested for hay or used for grazing which eventually might result in a regrowth of forest . In some areas the modern practice of building ski runs by mechanical means has destroyed the underlying tundra from which the plant life can not recover during the non-skiing months , whereas areas that still practice a natural piste type of ski slope building preserve the fragile underlayers .
The region 's economy greatly depends on agriculture ; rice and rubber have long been prominent exports . Manufacturing and services are becoming more important . An emerging market , Indonesia is the largest economy in this region . Newly industrialised countries include Indonesia , Malaysia , Thailand , and the Philippines , while Singapore and Brunei are affluent developed economies . The rest of Southeast Asia is still heavily dependent on agriculture , but Vietnam is notably making steady progress in developing its industrial sectors . The region notably manufactures textiles , electronic high-tech goods such as microprocessors and heavy industrial products such as automobiles . Oil reserves in Southeast Asia are plentiful .
In a book called Science Versus Crime , Houck writes that Popper 's falsificationism can be questioned logically : it is not clear how Popper would deal with a statement like " for every metal , there is a temperature at which it will melt . " The hypothesis can not be falsified by any possible observation , for there will always be a higher temperature than tested at which the metal may in fact melt , yet it seems to be a valid scientific hypothesis . These examples were pointed out by Carl Gustav Hempel . Hempel came to acknowledge that Logical Positivism 's verificationism was untenable , but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone . The simplest response to this is that , because Popper describes how theories attain , maintain and lose scientific status , individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge , and both of Hempel 's examples fall under this category . For instance , atomic theory implies that all metals melt at some temperature .
In August 2013 , The Irish Sun ended the practice of featuring topless models on Page 3 . The main newspaper was reported to have followed in 2015 with the edition of 16 January supposedly the last to carry such photographs after a report in The Times made such an assertion . After substantial coverage in the media about an alleged change in editorial policy , Page 3 returned to its usual format on 22 January 2015 . A few hours before the issue was published , the Head of PR at the newspaper said the reputed end of Page 3 had been " speculation " only .
The practice of labelling the infringement of exclusive rights in creative works as " piracy " predates statutory copyright law . Prior to the Statute of Anne in 1710 , the Stationers ' Company of London in 1557 , received a Royal Charter giving the company a monopoly on publication and tasking it with enforcing the charter . Those who violated the charter were labelled pirates as early as 1603 . The term " piracy " has been used to refer to the unauthorized copying , distribution and selling of works in copyright . Article 12 of the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works uses the term " piracy " in relation to copyright infringement , stating " Pirated works may be seized on importation into those countries of the Union where the original work enjoys legal protection . " Article 61 of the 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ( TRIPs ) requires criminal procedures and penalties in cases of " willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale . " Piracy traditionally refers to acts of copyright infringement intentionally committed for financial gain , though more recently , copyright holders have described online copyright infringement , particularly in relation to peer-to-peer file sharing networks , as " piracy . "
Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim described von Neumann as the " fastest mind I ever met " , and Jacob Bronowski wrote " He was the cleverest man I ever knew , without exception . He was a genius . " George Pólya , whose lectures at ETH Zürich von Neumann attended as a student , said " Johnny was the only student I was ever afraid of . If in the course of a lecture I stated an unsolved problem , the chances were he 'd come to me at the end of the lecture with the complete solution scribbled on a slip of paper . " Halmos recounts a story told by Nicholas Metropolis , concerning the speed of von Neumann 's calculations , when somebody asked von Neumann to solve the famous fly puzzle :
The New York Times reported that " government officials in Beijing and Sichuan have said they are investigating the collapses . In an acknowledgment of the weakness of building codes in the countryside , the National Development and Reform Commission said on May 27 that it had drafted an amendment to improve construction standards for primary and middle schools in rural areas . Experts are reviewing the draft , the commission said . " To limit protests , officials pushed parents to sign a document , which forbade them from holding protests , in exchange of money , but some who refused to sign were threatened . The payment amounts varied from school to school but were approximately the same . In Hanwang , parents were offered a package valued at 8,800 USD in cash and a per-parent pension of nearly 5,600 USD . Furthermore , officials used other methods of silencing : riot police officers broke up protests by parents ; the authorities set up cordons around the schools ; and officials ordered the Chinese news media to stop reporting on school collapses .
LeToya Luckett and Roberson became unhappy with Mathew 's managing of the band and eventually were replaced by Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams . Beyoncé experienced depression following the split with Luckett and Roberson after being publicly blamed by the media , critics , and blogs for its cause . Her long-standing boyfriend left her at this time . The depression was so severe it lasted for a couple of years , during which she occasionally kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything . Beyoncé stated that she struggled to speak about her depression because Destiny 's Child had just won their first Grammy Award and she feared no one would take her seriously . Beyoncé would later speak of her mother as the person who helped her fight it . Franklin was dismissed , leaving just Beyoncé , Rowland , and Williams .
All federal agencies are prohibited from authorizing , funding or carrying out actions that " destroy or adversely modify " critical habitats ( Section 7 ( a ) ( 2 ) ) . While the regulatory aspect of critical habitat does not apply directly to private and other non-federal landowners , large-scale development , logging and mining projects on private and state land typically require a federal permit and thus become subject to critical habitat regulations . Outside or in parallel with regulatory processes , critical habitats also focus and encourage voluntary actions such as land purchases , grant making , restoration , and establishment of reserves .
The pro-decolonisation Labour government , elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee , moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire : that of Indian independence . India 's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades , but disagreed as to how it should be implemented . Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state , whereas the League , fearing domination by the Hindu majority , desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions . Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948 . When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent , the newly appointed ( and last ) Viceroy , Lord Mountbatten , hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947 . The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan . Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa , and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives . Burma , which had been administered as part of the British Raj , and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948 . India , Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth , while Burma chose not to join .
Nishimura 's force consisted of two battleships , one cruiser and four destroyers . Because they were observing radio silence , Nishimura was unable to synchronize with Shima and Kurita . Nishimura and Shima had failed to even coordinate their plans before the attacks – they were long-time rivals and neither wished to have anything to do with the other . When he entered the narrow Surigao Strait at about 02:00 , Shima was 22 miles ( 40 km ) behind him , and Kurita was still in the Sibuyan Sea , several hours from the beaches at Leyte . As they passed Panaon Island , Nishimura 's force ran into a trap set for them by the U.S.-Australian 7th Fleet Support Force . R. Adm. Jesse Oldendorf had six battleships , four heavy cruisers , four light cruisers , 29 destroyers and 39 PT boats . To pass the strait and reach the landings , Nishimura had to run the gauntlet . At about 03:00 the Japanese battleship Fusō and three destroyers were hit by torpedoes and Fusō broke in two . At 03:50 the U.S. battleships opened fire . Radar fire control meant they could hit targets from a much greater distance than the Japanese . The battleship Yamashiro , a cruiser and a destroyer were crippled by 16-inch ( 406 mm ) shells ; Yamashiro sank at 04:19 . Only one of Nishimura 's force of seven ships survived the engagement . At 04:25 Shima 's force of two cruisers and eight destroyers reached the battle . Seeing Fusō and believing her to be the wrecks of two battleships , Shima ordered a retreat , ending the last battleship-vs-battleship action in history .
On the other hand , certain financial techniques can reduce the impact of such purchases on the currency . One is sterilisation , in which highly valued assets are sold at the same time that the weaker assets are purchased , which keeps the money supply neutral . Another technique is simply to accept the bad assets as long-term collateral ( as opposed to short-term repo swaps ) to be held until their market value stabilises . This would imply , as a quid pro quo , adjustments in taxation and expenditure in the economies of the weaker states to improve the perceived value of the assets .
The United States took control of the island in the 1898 Spanish–American War , as part of the Treaty of Paris . Guam was transferred to U.S. Navy control on 23 December 1898 by Executive Order 108-A . Guam came to serve as a station for American ships traveling to and from the Philippines , while the Northern Mariana Islands passed to Germany , and then to Japan . A U.S. Navy yard was established at Piti in 1899 , and a marine barracks at Sumay in 1901.:13 Following the Philippine–American War , Emilio Aguinaldo and Apolinario Mabini were exiled on Guam in 1901. : vi
Whitehead describes causal efficacy as " the experience dominating the primitive living organisms , which have a sense for the fate from which they have emerged , and the fate towards which they go . " It is , in other words , the sense of causal relations between entities , a feeling of being influenced and affected by the surrounding environment , unmediated by the senses . Presentational immediacy , on the other hand , is what is usually referred to as " pure sense perception " , unmediated by any causal or symbolic interpretation , even unconscious interpretation . In other words , it is pure appearance , which may or may not be delusive ( e.g . mistaking an image in a mirror for " the real thing " ) .
General Electric switched to use the ASA scale in 1946 . Meters manufactured since February 1946 were equipped with the ASA scale ( labeled " Exposure Index " ) already . For some of the older meters with scales in " Film Speed " or " Film Value " ( e.g . models DW-48 , DW-49 as well as early DW-58 and GW-68 variants ) , replaceable hoods with ASA scales were available from the manufacturer . The company continued to publish recommended film values after that date , however , they were now aligned to the ASA scale .
The most popular available tourist destinations in Myanmar include big cities such as Yangon and Mandalay ; religious sites in Mon State , Pindaya , Bago and Hpa-An ; nature trails in Inle Lake , Kengtung , Putao , Pyin Oo Lwin ; ancient cities such as Bagan and Mrauk-U ; as well as beaches in Nabule , Ngapali , Ngwe-Saung , Mergui . Nevertheless , much of the country is off-limits to tourists , and interactions between foreigners and the people of Myanmar , particularly in the border regions , are subject to police scrutiny . They are not to discuss politics with foreigners , under penalty of imprisonment and , in 2001 , the Myanmar Tourism Promotion Board issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit " unnecessary contact " between foreigners and ordinary Burmese people .
North Carolina has a variety of shopping choices . SouthPark Mall in Charlotte is currently the largest in the Carolinas , with almost 2.0 million square feet . Other major malls in Charlotte include Northlake Mall and Carolina Place Mall in nearby suburb Pineville . Other major malls throughout the state include Hanes Mall in Winston-Salem ; Crabtree Valley Mall , North Hills Mall , and Triangle Town Center in Raleigh ; Friendly Center and Four Seasons Town Centre in Greensboro ; Oak Hollow Mall in High Point ; Concord Mills in Concord ; Valley Hills Mall in Hickory ; and The Streets at Southpoint and Northgate Mall in Durham and Independence Mall in Wilmington , NC , and Tanger Outlets in Charlotte , Nags Head , Blowing Rock , and Mebane , NC .
Many of the instruments used to perform medieval music still exist , but in different forms . Medieval instruments included the wood flute ( which in the 21st century is made of metal ) , the recorder and plucked string instruments like the lute . As well , early versions of the organ , fiddle ( or vielle ) , and trombone ( called the sackbut ) existed . Medieval instruments in Europe had most commonly been used singly , often self accompanied with a drone note , or occasionally in parts . From at least as early as the 13th century through the 15th century there was a division of instruments into haut ( loud , shrill , outdoor instruments ) and bas ( quieter , more intimate instruments ) .
Bonaparte began with an army of 13,000 men ; 1,500 were reported missing , 1,200 died in combat , and thousands perished from disease—mostly bubonic plague . He failed to reduce the fortress of Acre , so he marched his army back to Egypt in May . To speed up the retreat , Bonaparte ordered plague-stricken men to be poisoned with opium ; the number who died remains disputed , ranging from a low of 30 to a high of 580 . He also brought out 1,000 wounded men . Back in Egypt on 25 July , Bonaparte defeated an Ottoman amphibious invasion at Abukir .
The Slovenian countryside displays a variety of disguised groups and individual characters among which the most popular and characteristic is the Kurent ( plural : Kurenti ) , a monstrous and demon-like , but fluffy figure . The most significant festival is held in Ptuj ( see : Kurentovanje ) . Its special feature are the Kurents themselves , magical creatures from another world , who visit major events throughout the country , trying to banish the winter and announce spring 's arrival , fertility , and new life with noise and dancing . The origin of the Kurent is a mystery , and not much is known of the times , beliefs , or purposes connected with its first appearance . The origin of the name itself is obscure .
Initially , officials were unable to contact the Wolong National Nature Reserve , home to around 280 giant pandas . However , the Foreign Ministry later said that a group of 31 British tourists visiting the Wolong Panda Reserve in the quake-hit area returned safe and uninjured to Chengdu . Nonetheless , the well-being of an even greater number of pandas in the neighbouring panda reserves remained unknown . Five security guards at the reserve were killed by the earthquake . Six pandas escaped after their enclosures were damaged . By May 20 , two pandas at the reserve were found to be injured , while the search continued for another two adult pandas that went missing after the quake . By May 28 , 2008 , one panda was still missing . The missing panda was later found dead under the rubble of an enclosure . Nine-year-old Mao Mao , a mother of five at the breeding center , was discovered on Monday , her body crushed by a wall in her enclosure . Panda keepers and other workers placed her remains in a small wooden crate and buried her outside the breeding centre .
Russia had previously obtained recognition from the Ottoman Empire of the Tsar 's role as special guardian of the Orthodox Christians in Moldavia and Wallachia . Now Russia used the Sultan 's failure to resolve the issue of the protection of the Christian sites in the Holy Land as a pretext for Russian occupation of these Danubian provinces . Nicholas believed that the European powers , especially Austria , would not object strongly to the annexation of a few neighbouring Ottoman provinces , especially considering that Russia had assisted Austria 's efforts in suppressing the Hungarian Revolution in 1849 .
There are 29 isotopes of copper . 63Cu and 65Cu are stable , with 63Cu comprising approximately 69 % of naturally occurring copper ; they both have a spin of 3⁄2 . The other isotopes are radioactive , with the most stable being 67Cu with a half-life of 61.83 hours . Seven metastable isotopes have been characterized , with 68mCu the longest-lived with a half-life of 3.8 minutes . Isotopes with a mass number above 64 decay by β− , whereas those with a mass number below 64 decay by β+ . 64Cu , which has a half-life of 12.7 hours , decays both ways .
Quotient groups and subgroups together form a way of describing every group by its presentation : any group is the quotient of the free group over the generators of the group , quotiented by the subgroup of relations . The dihedral group D4 , for example , can be generated by two elements r and f ( for example , r = r1 , the right rotation and f = fv the vertical ( or any other ) reflection ) , which means that every symmetry of the square is a finite composition of these two symmetries or their inverses . Together with the relations
Forbes magazine began reporting on Beyoncé 's earnings in 2008 , calculating that the $ 80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008 , for her music , tour , films and clothing line made her the world 's best-paid music personality at the time , above Madonna and Celine Dion . They placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009 and ninth on the " Most Powerful Women in the World " list in 2010 . The following year , Forbes placed her eighth on the " Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30 " list , having earned $ 35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals . In 2012 , Forbes placed Beyoncé at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list , twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $ 40 million in the past year for her album 4 , clothing line and endorsement deals . In the same year , Beyoncé and Jay Z placed at number one on the " World 's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples " , for collectively earning $ 78 million . The couple made it into the previous year 's Guinness World Records as the " highest-earning power couple " for collectively earning $ 122 million in 2009 . For the years 2009 to 2011 , Beyoncé earned an average of $ 70 million per year , and earned $ 40 million in 2012 . In 2013 , Beyoncé 's endorsements of Pepsi and H & M made her and Jay Z the world 's first billion dollar couple in the music industry . That year , Beyoncé was published as the fourth most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings . MTV estimated that by the end of 2014 , Beyoncé would become the highest-paid black musician in history ; she succeeded to do so in April 2014 . In June 2014 , Beyoncé ranked at # 1 on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list , earning an estimated $ 115 million throughout June 2013 – June 2014 . This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date . As of May 2015 , her net worth is estimated to be $ 250 million .
From 1842 onwards , Chopin showed signs of serious illness . After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842 , he wrote to Grzymała : " I have to lie in bed all day long , my mouth and tonsils are aching so much . " He was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from Alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Erard 's on 1 March 1843 . Late in 1844 , Charles Hallé visited Chopin and found him " hardly able to move , bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain " , although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor . Chopin 's health continued to deteriorate , particularly from this time onwards . Modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses , he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy .
Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon supply chain efficiencies to sell established technologies at low prices , instead of being an innovator . By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector . Dell 's low spending on R & D relative to its revenue ( compared to IBM , Hewlett Packard , and Apple Inc. ) —which worked well in the commoditized PC market—prevented it from making inroads into more lucrative segments , such as MP3 players and later mobile devices . Increasing spending on R & D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized . Dell had done well with a horizontal organization that focused on PCs when the computing industry moved to horizontal mix-and-match layers in the 1980s , but by the mid-2000 the industry shifted to vertically integrated stacks to deliver complete IT solutions and Dell lagged far behind competitors like Hewlett Packard and Oracle .
Within the City of Westminster in London the entertainment district of the West End has its focus around Leicester Square , where London and world film premieres are held , and Piccadilly Circus , with its giant electronic advertisements . London 's theatre district is here , as are many cinemas , bars , clubs and restaurants , including the city 's Chinatown district ( in Soho ) , and just to the east is Covent Garden , an area housing speciality shops . The city is the home of Andrew Lloyd Webber , whose musicals have dominated the West End theatre since the late 20th century . The United Kingdom 's Royal Ballet , English National Ballet , Royal Opera and English National Opera are based in London and perform at the Royal Opera House , the London Coliseum , Sadler 's Wells Theatre and the Royal Albert Hall as well as touring the country .
The Roman Republic ( Latin : Res publica Romana ; Classical Latin : [ ˈreːs ˈpuːb.lɪ.ka roːˈmaː.na ] ) was the period of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom , traditionally dated to 509 BC , and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire . It was during this period that Rome 's control expanded from the city 's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world . During the first two centuries of its existence , the Roman Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance , from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula . By the following century , it included North Africa , Spain , and what is now southern France . Two centuries after that , towards the end of the 1st century BC , it included the rest of modern France , Greece , and much of the eastern Mediterranean . By this time , internal tensions led to a series of civil wars , culminating with the assassination of Julius Caesar , which led to the transition from republic to empire . The exact date of transition can be a matter of interpretation . Historians have variously proposed Julius Caesar 's crossing of the Rubicon River in 49 BC , Caesar 's appointment as dictator for life in 44 BC , and the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . However , most use the same date as did the ancient Romans themselves , the Roman Senate 's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian and his adopting the title Augustus in 27 BC , as the defining event ending the Republic .
Household survey results suggest the percentage of households spending less than £20 per week on a per capita basis fell from 27 % to 8 % between 2000 and 2004 , implying a decline in income poverty . Nevertheless , 22 % of the population claimed social security benefit in 2006/7 , most of them aged over 60 , a sector that represents 20 % of the population .
Orontid Armenia formally passed to empire of Alexander the Great following his conquest of Persia . Alexander appointed an Orontid named Mithranes to govern Armenia . Armenia later became a vassal state of the Seleucid Empire , but it maintained a considerable degree of autonomy , retaining its native rulers . Towards the end 212 BC the country was divided into two kingdoms , Greater Armenia and Armenia Sophene including Commagene or Armenia Minor . The kingdoms became so independent from Seleucid control that Antiochus III the Great waged war on them during his reign and replaced their rulers .
Salts of many oxidation states of uranium are water-soluble and may be studied in aqueous solutions . The most common ionic forms are U3+ ( brown-red ) , U4+ ( green ) , UO+ 2 ( unstable ) , and UO2+ 2 ( yellow ) , for U ( III ) , U ( IV ) , U ( V ) , and U ( VI ) , respectively . A few solid and semi-metallic compounds such as UO and US exist for the formal oxidation state uranium ( II ) , but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state . Ions of U3+ liberate hydrogen from water and are therefore considered to be highly unstable . The UO2+ 2 ion represents the uranium ( VI ) state and is known to form compounds such as uranyl carbonate , uranyl chloride and uranyl sulfate . UO2+ 2 also forms complexes with various organic chelating agents , the most commonly encountered of which is uranyl acetate .
With Lieutenant-General Matthew Ridgway assuming the command of the U.S. Eighth Army on 26 December , the PVA and the KPA launched their Third Phase Offensive ( also known as the " Chinese New Year 's Offensive " ) on New Year 's Eve of 1950 . Utilizing night attacks in which UN Command fighting positions were encircled and then assaulted by numerically superior troops who had the element of surprise , the attacks were accompanied by loud trumpets and gongs , which fulfilled the double purpose of facilitating tactical communication and mentally disorienting the enemy . UN forces initially had no familiarity with this tactic , and as a result some soldiers panicked , abandoning their weapons and retreating to the south . The Chinese New Year 's Offensive overwhelmed UN forces , allowing the PVA and KPA to conquer Seoul for the second time on 4 January 1951 .
In times past , until the 15th century , in Korea , Literary Chinese was the dominant form of written communication , prior to the creation of hangul , the Korean alphabet . Much of the vocabulary , especially in the realms of science and sociology , comes directly from Chinese , comparable to Latin or Greek root words in European languages . However , due to the lack of tones in Korean , [ citation needed ] as the words were imported from Chinese , many dissimilar characters took on identical sounds , and subsequently identical spelling in hangul . [ citation needed ] Chinese characters are sometimes used to this day for either clarification in a practical manner , or to give a distinguished appearance , as knowledge of Chinese characters is considered a high class attribute and an indispensable part of a classical education . [ citation needed ] It is also observed that the preference for Chinese characters is treated as being conservative and Confucian .
Sichuan came under the firm control of a Chinese central government during the Sui dynasty , but it was during the subsequent Tang dynasty where Sichuan regained its previous political and cultural prominence for which it was known during the Han . Chengdu became nationally known as a supplier of armies and the home of Du Fu , who is sometimes called China 's greatest poet . During the An Lushan Rebellion ( 755-763 ) , Emperor Xuanzong of Tang fled from Chang'an to Sichuan . The region was torn by constant warfare and economic distress as it was besieged by the Tibetan Empire .
The U.S. War Department created the first antecedent of the U.S. Air Force in 1907 , which through a succession of changes of organization , titles , and missions advanced toward eventual separation 40 years later . In World War II , almost 68,000 U.S airmen died helping to win the war ; only the infantry suffered more enlisted casualties . In practice , the U.S. Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) was virtually independent of the Army during World War II , but officials wanted formal independence . The National Security Act of 1947 was signed on on 26 July 1947 by President Harry S Truman , which established the Department of the Air Force , but it was not not until 18 September 1947 , when the first secretary of the Air Force , W. Stuart Symington was sworn into office that the Air Force was officially formed .
In contrast to the Fed , the ECB normally does not buy bonds outright . The normal procedure used by the ECB for manipulating the money supply has been via the so-called refinancing facilities . In these facilities , bonds are not purchased but used in reverse transactions : repurchase agreements , or collateralised loans . These two transactions are similar , i.e . bonds are used as collaterals for loans , the difference being of legal nature . In the repos the ownership of the collateral changes to the ECB until the loan is repaid .
In 1981 , the new US President Ronald Reagan pursued a hard line approach to Libya , erroneously considering it a puppet regime of the Soviet Union . In turn , Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets , visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985 , and threatening to join the Warsaw Pact . The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi , seeing him as an unpredictable extremist . Beginning military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte – an area of sea that Libya claimed as a part of its territorial waters – in August 1981 the U.S. shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes monitoring them . Closing down Libya 's embassy in Washington , D.C. , Reagan advised U.S. companies operating in the country to reduce the number of American personnel stationed there . In March 1982 , the U.S. implemented an embargo of Libyan oil , and in January 1986 ordered all U.S. companies to cease operating in the country , although several hundred workers remained . Diplomatic relations also broke down with the U.K. , after Libyan diplomats were accused in the shooting death of Yvonne Fletcher , a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy , in April 1984 . In Spring 1986 , the U.S. Navy again began performing exercises in the Gulf of Sirte ; the Libyan military retaliated , but failed as the U.S. sank several Libyan ships .
In Knoxville , the Tennessee Volunteers college team has played in the Southeastern Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association since 1932 . The football team has won 13 SEC championships and 25 bowls , including four Sugar Bowls , three Cotton Bowls , an Orange Bowl and a Fiesta Bowl . Meanwhile , the men 's basketball team has won four SEC championships and reached the NCAA Elite Eight in 2010 . In addition , the women 's basketball team has won a host of SEC regular-season and tournament titles along with 8 national titles .
The Gregorian calendar is a solar calendar . A regular Gregorian year consists of 365 days , but as in the Julian calendar , in a leap year , a leap day is added to February . In the Julian calendar a leap year occurs every 4 years , but the Gregorian calendar omits 3 leap days every 400 years . In the Julian calendar , this leap day was inserted by doubling 24 February , and the Gregorian reform did not change the date of the leap day . In the modern period , it has become customary to number the days from the beginning of the month , and February 29th is often considered as the leap day . Some churches , notably the Roman Catholic Church , delay February festivals after the 23rd by one day in leap years .
It also includes the alternative 1440×1152 HDMAC scan format . ( According to some reports , a mooted 750-line ( 720p ) format ( 720 progressively scanned lines ) was viewed by some at the ITU as an enhanced television format rather than a true HDTV format , and so was not included , although 1920×1080i and 1280×720p systems for a range of frame and field rates were defined by several US SMPTE standards . )
Her debut single , " Crazy in Love " was named VH1 's " Greatest Song of the 2000s " , NME 's " Best Track of the 00s " and " Pop Song of the Century " , considered by Rolling Stone to be one of the 500 greatest songs of all time , earned two Grammy Awards and is one of the best-selling singles of all time at around 8 million copies . The music video for " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) " , which achieved fame for its intricate choreography and its deployment of jazz hands , was credited by the Toronto Star as having started the " first major dance craze of both the new millennium and the Internet " , triggering a number of parodies of the dance choreography and a legion of amateur imitators on YouTube . In 2013 , Drake released a single titled " Girls Love Beyoncé " , which featured an interpolation from Destiny Child 's " Say My Name " and discussed his relationship with women . In January 2012 , research scientist Bryan Lessard named Scaptia beyonceae , a species of horse fly found in Northern Queensland , Australia after Beyoncé due to the fly 's unique golden hairs on its abdomen . In July 2014 , a Beyoncé exhibit was introduced into the " Legends of Rock " section of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . The black leotard from the " Single Ladies " video and her outfit from the Super Bowl half time performance are among several pieces housed at the museum .
Since the democratic transition began in 2011 , there has been continuous violence as 280 people have been killed and 140,000 forced to flee from their homes in the Rakhine state . A UN envoy reported in March 2013 that unrest had re-emerged between Myanmar 's Buddhist and Muslim communities , with violence spreading to towns that are located closer to Yangon . The BBC News media outlet obtained video footage of a man with severe burns who received no assistance from passers-by or police officers even though he was lying on the ground in a public area . The footage was filmed by members of the Burmese police force in the town of Meiktila and was used as evidence that Buddhists continued to kill Muslims after the European Union sanctions were lifted on 23 April 2013 .
In March 1875 , Bell and Pollok visited the famous scientist Joseph Henry , who was then director of the Smithsonian Institution , and asked Henry 's advice on the electrical multi-reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph . Henry replied that Bell had " the germ of a great invention " . When Bell said that he did not have the necessary knowledge , Henry replied , " Get it ! " That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying , even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments , nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas . However , a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and Thomas A. Watson , an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of Charles Williams , changed all that .
The variance in prevalence rates is reflected in people 's inconsistent responses to the different components of sexual orientation within a study and the instability of their responses over time . Laumann et al. , ( 1994 ) found that among U.S. adults 20 % of those who would be considered homosexual on one component of orientation were homosexual on the other two dimensions and 70 % responded in a way that was consistent with homosexuality on only one of the three dimensions . Furthermore , sexuality is fluid such that one 's sexual orientation is not necessarily stable or consistent over time but is subject to change throughout life . Diamond ( 2003 ) found that over 7 years 2/3 of the women changed their sexual identity at least once , with many reporting that the label was not adequate in capturing the diversity of their sexual or romantic feelings . Furthermore , women who relinquished bisexual and lesbian identification did not relinquish same sex sexuality and acknowledged the possibility for future same sex attractions and/or behaviour . One woman stated " I 'm mainly straight but I 'm one of those people who , if the right circumstance came along , would change my viewpoint " . Therefore , individuals classified as homosexual in one study might not be identified the same way in another depending on which components are assessed and when the assessment is made making it difficult to pin point who is homosexual and who is not and what the overall prevalence within a population may be .
The Soviet Union challenged the legitimacy of the war for several reasons . The ROK Army intelligence upon which Resolution 83 was based came from U.S. Intelligence ; North Korea was not invited as a sitting temporary member of the UN , which violated UN Charter Article 32 ; and the Korean conflict was beyond the UN Charter 's scope , because the initial north–south border fighting was classed as a civil war . Because the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council at the time , legal scholars posited that deciding upon an action of this type required the unanimous vote of the five permanent members .
A new Digimon series was announced 30 months after the end of Digimon Fusion at a 15th anniversary concert and theater event for the franchise in August 2014 . The series announced the return of the protagonists from the original Digimon Adventure series , most of them now as high school students . A countdown clicking game was posted on the show 's official website , offering news when specific clicks were met . On December 13 , 2014 the series title and a key visual featuring character designs by Atsuya Uki were revealed with Keitaro Motonaga announced as director with a tentative premiere date of Spring , 2015 . However , on May 6 , 2015 , it was announced that tri . would not be a television series , but rather a 6-part theatrical film series . The films are being streamed in episodic format outside Japan by Crunchyroll and Hulu from the same day they premiere on Japanese theaters .
Cuisine aroused a cultural pride in the accumulated richness of a long and varied past . The gentleman gourmet , such as Yuan Mei , applied aesthetic standards to the art of cooking , eating , and appreciation of tea at a time when New World crops and products entered everyday life . The Suiyuan Shidan written by him , detailed the culinary esthetics and theory , along with a wide range of recipes from the ruling period of Qianlong during Qing Dynasty . The Manchu Han Imperial Feast originated at the court . Although this banquet was probably never common , it reflected an appreciation by Han Chinese for Manchu culinary customs . Nevertheless , culinary traditionalists such as Yuan Mei lambasted the opulent culinary rituals of the Manchu Han Imperial Feast , saying that it is cause in part by " ... the vulgar habits of bad chefs " and that " Display this trite are useful only for welcoming new relations through one’s gates or when the boss comes to visit . " ( 皆惡廚陋習。只可用之於新親上門，上司入境 )
Lester Brown states that the market " does not incorporate the indirect costs of providing goods or services into prices , it does not value nature 's services adequately , and it does not respect the sustainable-yield thresholds of natural systems " . It also favors the near term over the long term , thereby showing limited concern for future generations . Tax and subsidy shifting can help overcome these problems , though is also problematic to combine different international normative regimes regulating this issue .
It is a fully developed legal system , with all the necessary elements : courts , lawyers , judges , a fully articulated legal code principles of legal interpretation , and coercive penalties , though it lacks civilly-binding force in most secular jurisdictions . The academic degrees in canon law are the J.C.B . ( Juris Canonici Baccalaureatus , Bachelor of Canon Law , normally taken as a graduate degree ) , J.C.L . ( Juris Canonici Licentiatus , Licentiate of Canon Law ) and the J.C.D . ( Juris Canonici Doctor , Doctor of Canon Law ) . Because of its specialized nature , advanced degrees in civil law or theology are normal prerequisites for the study of canon law .
Above the sessions exist presbyteries , which have area responsibilities . These are composed of teaching elders and ruling elders from each of the constituent congregations . The presbytery sends representatives to a broader regional or national assembly , generally known as the General Assembly , although an intermediate level of a synod sometimes exists . This congregation / presbytery / synod / general assembly schema is based on the historical structure of the larger Presbyterian churches , such as the Church of Scotland or the Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) ; some bodies , such as the Presbyterian Church in America and the Presbyterian Church in Ireland , skip one of the steps between congregation and General Assembly , and usually the step skipped is the Synod . The Church of Scotland has now abolished the Synod . [ citation needed ]
The great angiosperm radiation , when a great diversity of angiosperms appears in the fossil record , occurred in the mid-Cretaceous ( approximately 100 million years ago ) . However , a study in 2007 estimated that the division of the five most recent ( the genus Ceratophyllum , the family Chloranthaceae , the eudicots , the magnoliids , and the monocots ) of the eight main groups occurred around 140 million years ago . By the late Cretaceous , angiosperms appear to have dominated environments formerly occupied by ferns and cycadophytes , but large canopy-forming trees replaced conifers as the dominant trees only close to the end of the Cretaceous 66 million years ago or even later , at the beginning of the Tertiary . The radiation of herbaceous angiosperms occurred much later . Yet , many fossil plants recognizable as belonging to modern families ( including beech , oak , maple , and magnolia ) had already appeared by the late Cretaceous .
In more recent years , however , many country pubs have either closed down , or have been converted to establishments intent on providing seating facilities for the consumption of food , rather than a venue for members of the local community meeting and convivially drinking .
Writing to a friend in May 1795 , Burke surveyed the causes of discontent : " I think I can hardly overrate the malignity of the principles of Protestant ascendency , as they affect Ireland ; or of Indianism [ i.e . corporate tyranny , as practiced by the British East Indies Company ] , as they affect these countries , and as they affect Asia ; or of Jacobinism , as they affect all Europe , and the state of human society itself . The last is the greatest evil " . By March 1796 , however Burke had changed his mind : " Our Government and our Laws are beset by two different Enemies , which are sapping its foundations , Indianism , and Jacobinism . In some Cases they act separately , in some they act in conjunction : But of this I am sure ; that the first is the worst by far , and the hardest to deal with ; and for this amongst other reasons , that it weakens discredits , and ruins that force , which ought to be employed with the greatest Credit and Energy against the other ; and that it furnishes Jacobinism with its strongest arms against all formal Government " .
Easter was the Sunday after the 15th day of this moon , whose 14th day was allowed to precede the equinox . Where the two systems produced different dates there was generally a compromise so that both churches were able to celebrate on the same day . By the 10th century all churches ( except some on the eastern border of the Byzantine Empire ) had adopted the Alexandrian Easter , which still placed the vernal equinox on 21 March , although Bede had already noted its drift in 725—it had drifted even further by the 16th century .
The first written account of a game played was on October 15 , 1862 , on the Montreal Cricket Grounds . It was between the First Battalion Grenadier Guards and the Second Battalion Scots Fusilier Guards resulting in a win by the Grenadier Guards 3 goals , 2 rouges to nothing . [ citation needed ] In 1864 , at Trinity College , Toronto , F. Barlow Cumberland , Frederick A. Bethune , and Christopher Gwynn , one of the founders of Milton , Massachusetts , devised rules based on rugby football . The game gradually gained a following , with the Hamilton Football Club formed on November 3 , 1869 , ( the oldest football club in Canada ) . Montreal formed a team April 8 , 1872 , Toronto was formed on October 4 , 1873 , and the Ottawa FBC on September 20 , 1876 .
The A38 dual-carriageway runs from east to west across the north of the city . Within the city it is designated as 'The Parkway ' and represents the boundary between the urban parts of the city and the generally more recent suburban areas . Heading east , it connects Plymouth to the M5 motorway about 40 miles ( 65 km ) away near Exeter ; and heading west it connects Cornwall and Devon via the Tamar Bridge . Regular bus services are provided by Plymouth Citybus , First South West and Target Travel . There are three Park and ride services located at Milehouse , Coypool ( Plympton ) and George Junction ( Plymouth City Airport ) , which are operated by First South West .
The King presides over a period of misrule in which conventional social rules may be broken and reckless behavior is encouraged . Festivities are held in the open air , beginning with a cercavila , a ritual procession throughout the town to call everyone to attend . Rues of masked revelers dance alongside . On Thursday Dijous Gras ( Fat Thursday ) is celebrated , also called 'omelette day ' ( el dia de la truita ) , coques ( de llardons , butifarra d'ou , butifarra ) and omelettes are eaten . The festivities end on Ash Wednesday with elaborate funeral rituals marking the death of King Carnival , who is typically burned on a pyre in what is called the burial of the sardine ( enterrament de la sardina ) , or , in Vilanova , as l'enterro .
A dispute during the Lausanne Congress of Supreme Councils of 1875 prompted the Grand Orient de France to commission a report by a Protestant pastor which concluded that , as Freemasonry was not a religion , it should not require a religious belief . The new constitutions read , " Its principles are absolute liberty of conscience and human solidarity " , the existence of God and the immortality of the soul being struck out . It is possible that the immediate objections of the United Grand Lodge of England were at least partly motivated by the political tension between France and Britain at the time . The result was the withdrawal of recognition of the Grand Orient of France by the United Grand Lodge of England , a situation that continues today .
New York City is supplied with drinking water by the protected Catskill Mountains watershed . As a result of the watershed 's integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration system , New York is one of only four major cities in the United States the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants . The Croton Watershed north of the city is undergoing construction of a US $ 3.2 billion water purification plant to augment New York City 's water supply by an estimated 290 million gallons daily , representing a greater than 20 % addition to the city 's current availability of water . The ongoing expansion of New York City Water Tunnel No . 3 , an integral part of the New York City water supply system , is the largest capital construction project in the city 's history .
There are eleven Renaissance allegorical statues on public fountains in the Old Town . Nearly all the 16th century fountains , except the Zähringer fountain which was created by Hans Hiltbrand , are the work of the Fribourg master Hans Gieng . One of the more interesting fountains is the Kindlifresserbrunnen ( Bernese German : Child Eater Fountain but often translated Ogre Fountain ) which is claimed to represent a Jew , the Greek god Chronos or a Fastnacht figure that scares disobedient children .
A particular criticism of the Buddha was Vedic animal sacrifice . [ web 18 ] He also mocked the Vedic " hymn of the cosmic man " . However , the Buddha was not anti-Vedic , and declared that the Veda in its true form was declared by " Kashyapa " to certain rishis , who by severe penances had acquired the power to see by divine eyes . He names the Vedic rishis , and declared that the original Veda of the rishis [ note 25 ] was altered by a few Brahmins who introduced animal sacrifices . The Buddha says that it was on this alteration of the true Veda that he refused to pay respect to the Vedas of his time . However , he did not denounce the union with Brahman , [ note 26 ] or the idea of the self uniting with the Self . At the same time , the traditional Hindu itself gradually underwent profound changes , transforming it into what is recognized as early Hinduism .
After years of demanding greater political autonomy , residents were given the right to directly elect a Head of Government and the representatives of the unicameral Legislative Assembly by popular vote in 1997 . Ever since , the left-wing Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) has controlled both of them . In recent years , the local government has passed a wave of liberal policies , such as abortion on request , a limited form of euthanasia , no-fault divorce , and same-sex marriage . On January 29 , 2016 , it ceased to be called the Federal District ( Spanish : Distrito Federal or D.F . ) and is now in transition to become the country 's 32nd federal entity , giving it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state . Because of a clause in the Mexican Constitution , however , as the seat of the powers of the Union , it can never become a state , lest the capital of the country be relocated elsewhere .
The front page caused outrage in Liverpool , where the paper lost more than three-quarters of its estimated 55,000 daily sales and still sells poorly in the city more than 25 years later ( around 12,000 ) . It is unavailable in many parts of the city , as many newsagents refuse to stock it . It was revealed in a documentary called Alexei Sayle 's Liverpool , aired in September 2008 , that many Liverpudlians will not even take the newspaper for free , and those who do may simply burn or tear it up . Liverpudlians refer to the paper as 'The Scum ' with campaigners believing it handicapped their fight for justice .
Located in Yangtze River Delta area and the center of East China , Nanjing is home to one of the world 's largest inland ports . Nanjing is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the People 's Republic of China 's administrative structure , enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province . Nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of " Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength " issued by the National Statistics Bureau , and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta . It has also been awarded the title of 2008 Habitat Scroll of Honour of China , Special UN Habitat Scroll of Honour Award and National Civilized City . Nanjing boasts many high-quality universities and research institutes , with the number of universities listed in 100 National Key Universities ranking third , including Nanjing University . The ratio of college students to total population ranks No.1 among large cities nationwide . Nanjing is one of the three Chinese top research centres according to Nature Index .
The early 1990s marked the softening of urban R & B at the same time alternative rock emerged and traditional pop saw a significant resurgence . This in part led to a widening of the market , not only allowing to cater to more niche markets , but it also became customary for artists to make AC-friendly singles .
Global agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity , give " sovereign national rights over biological resources " ( not property ) . The agreements commit countries to " conserve biodiversity " , " develop resources for sustainability " and " share the benefits " resulting from their use . Biodiverse countries that allow bioprospecting or collection of natural products , expect a share of the benefits rather than allowing the individual or institution that discovers/exploits the resource to capture them privately . Bioprospecting can become a type of biopiracy when such principles are not respected . [ citation needed ]
LED lamps have been advocated as the newest and best environmental lighting method . According to the Energy Saving Trust , LED lamps use only 10 % power compared to a standard incandescent bulb , where compact fluorescent lamps use 20 % and energy saving halogen lamps 70 % . The lifetime is also much longer — up to 50,000 hours . A downside is still the initial cost , which is higher than that of compact fluorescent lamps .
The troops were reembarked and moved to the Bay of St. Lunaire in Brittany where , on 3 September , they were landed to operate against St. Malo ; however , this action proved impractical . Worsening weather forced the two armies to separate : the ships sailed for the safer anchorage of St . Cast , while the army proceeded overland . The tardiness of Bligh in moving his forces allowed a French force of 10,000 from Brest to catch up with him and open fire on the reembarkation troops . A rear-guard of 1,400 under General Dury held off the French while the rest of the army embarked . They could not be saved ; 750 , including Dury , were killed and the rest captured .
Yale 's central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres ( 1.1 km2 ) and comprises its main , historic campus and a medical campus adjacent to the Yale-New Haven Hospital . In western New Haven , the university holds 500 acres ( 2.0 km2 ) of athletic facilities , including the Yale Golf Course . In 2008 , Yale purchased the 136-acre ( 0.55 km2 ) former Bayer Pharmaceutical campus in West Haven , Connecticut , the buildings of which are now used as laboratory and research space . Yale also owns seven forests in Connecticut , Vermont , and New Hampshire—the largest of which is the 7,840-acre ( 31.7 km2 ) Yale-Myers Forest in Connecticut 's Quiet Corner—and nature preserves including Horse Island .
In league competitions , games may end in a draw . In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock , some competitions may invoke replays . A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time , which consists of two further 15-minute periods . If the score is still tied after extra time , some competitions allow the use of penalty shootouts ( known officially in the Laws of the Game as " kicks from the penalty mark " ) to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament . Goals scored during extra time periods count toward the final score of the game , but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament ( with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score ) .
High-power LEDs ( HP-LEDs ) or high-output LEDs ( HO-LEDs ) can be driven at currents from hundreds of mA to more than an ampere , compared with the tens of mA for other LEDs . Some can emit over a thousand lumens . LED power densities up to 300 W/cm2 have been achieved . Since overheating is destructive , the HP-LEDs must be mounted on a heat sink to allow for heat dissipation . If the heat from a HP-LED is not removed , the device will fail in seconds . One HP-LED can often replace an incandescent bulb in a flashlight , or be set in an array to form a powerful LED lamp .
Two Polish friends in Paris were also to play important roles in Chopin 's life there . His fellow student at the Warsaw Conservatory , Julian Fontana , had originally tried unsuccessfully to establish himself in England ; Albert Grzymała , who in Paris became a wealthy financier and society figure , often acted as Chopin 's adviser and " gradually began to fill the role of elder brother in [ his ] life . " Fontana was to become , in the words of Michałowski and Samson , Chopin 's " general factotum and copyist " .
Zhu Yousong , however , fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier . Beset by factional conflicts , his regime could not offer effective resistance to Qing forces , when the Qing army , led by the Manchu prince Dodo approached Jiangnan the next spring . Days after Yangzhou fell to the Manchus in late May 1645 , the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing , and the imperial Ming Palace was looted by local residents . On June 6 , Dodo 's troops approached Nanjing , and the commander of the city 's garrison , Zhao the Earl of Xincheng , promptly surrendered the city to them . The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the Manchu queue way . They requisitioned a large section of the city for the bannermen 's cantonment , and destroyed the former imperial Ming Palace , but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that befell Yangzhou .
Tajikistan ( i/tɑːˈdʒiːkᵻstɑːn/ , /təˈdʒiːkᵻstæn/ , or /tæˈdʒiːkiːstæn/ ; Persian : تاجيكستان‎‎ Тоҷикистон [ tɔd͡ʒikɪsˈtɔn ] ) , officially the Republic of Tajikistan ( Persian : جمهورى تاجيكستان‎‎ Tajik : Ҷумҳурии Тоҷикистон , Çumhuriji Toçikiston/Jumhuriyi Tojikiston ; Russian : Респу́блика Таджикистан , Respublika Tadzhikistan ) , is a mountainous , landlocked country in Central Asia with an estimated 8 million people in 2013 , and an area of 143,100 km2 ( 55,300 sq mi ) . It is bordered by Afghanistan to the south , Uzbekistan to the west , Kyrgyzstan to the north , and China to the east . Pakistan lies to the south , separated by the narrow Wakhan Corridor . Traditional homelands of Tajik people included present-day Tajikistan , Afghanistan and Uzbekistan .
Hume and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed a 'science of man ' , which was expressed historically in works by authors including James Burnett , Adam Ferguson , John Millar , and William Robertson , all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behaved in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of modernity . Modern sociology largely originated from this movement , and Hume 's philosophical concepts that directly influenced James Madison ( and thus the U.S. Constitution ) and as popularised by Dugald Stewart , would be the basis of classical liberalism .
Copper is an essential trace element in plants and animals , but not some microorganisms . The human body contains copper at a level of about 1.4 to 2.1 mg per kg of body mass . Stated differently , the RDA for copper in normal healthy adults is quoted as 0.97 mg/day and as 3.0 mg/day . Copper is absorbed in the gut , then transported to the liver bound to albumin . After processing in the liver , copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase . Copper transport here involves the protein ceruloplasmin , which carries the majority of copper in blood . Ceruloplasmin also carries copper that is excreted in milk , and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source . Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation ( about 5 mg a day , vs. about 1 mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body ) , and the body is able to excrete some excess copper , if needed , via bile , which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine .
Only insects which live in nests or colonies demonstrate any true capacity for fine-scale spatial orientation or homing . This can allow an insect to return unerringly to a single hole a few millimeters in diameter among thousands of apparently identical holes clustered together , after a trip of up to several kilometers ' distance . In a phenomenon known as philopatry , insects that hibernate have shown the ability to recall a specific location up to a year after last viewing the area of interest . A few insects seasonally migrate large distances between different geographic regions ( e.g. , the overwintering areas of the Monarch butterfly ) . :14
Tobacco was one of the first major industries to develop after the Civil War . Many farmers grew some tobacco , and the invention of the cigarette made the product especially popular . Winston-Salem is the birthplace of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company ( RJR ) , founded by R. J. Reynolds in 1874 as one of 16 tobacco companies in the town . By 1914 it was selling 425 million packs of Camels a year . Today it is the second-largest tobacco company in the U.S. ( behind Altria Group ) . RJR is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Reynolds American Inc. , which in turn is 42 % owned by British American Tobacco .
Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses ( actions or inactions ) of the domestic dog ( individuals or groups ) to internal and/or external stimuli . As the oldest domesticated species , with estimates ranging from 9,000–30,000 years BCE , the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans . As a result of this physical and social evolution , dogs , more than any other species , have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and they are uniquely attuned to our behaviors . Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the otherwise humble domestic dog . These abilities are not possessed by the dog 's closest canine relatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes . Rather , these skills parallel some of the social-cognitive skills of human children .
The term heresy is also used as an ideological pigeonhole for contemporary writers because , by definition , heresy depends on contrasts with an established orthodoxy . For example , the tongue-in-cheek contemporary usage of heresy , such as to categorize a " Wall Street heresy " a " Democratic heresy " or a " Republican heresy , " are metaphors that invariably retain a subtext that links orthodoxies in geology or biology or any other field to religion . These expanded metaphoric senses allude to both the difference between the person 's views and the mainstream and the boldness of such a person in propounding these views .
The morphology of Catalan personal pronouns is complex , specially in unstressed forms , which are numerous ( 13 distinct forms , compared to 11 in Spanish or 9 in Italian ) . Features include the gender-neutral ho and the great degree of freedom when combining different unstressed pronouns ( 65 combinations ) .
Beyoncé has been described as a having a wide-ranging sex appeal , with music journalist Touré writing that since the release of Dangerously in Love , she has " become a crossover sex symbol " . Offstage Beyoncé says that while she likes to dress sexily , her onstage dress " is absolutely for the stage . " Due to her curves and the term 's catchiness , in the 2000s , the media often used the term " Bootylicious " ( a portmanteau of the words booty and delicious ) to describe Beyoncé , the term popularized by Destiny 's Child 's single of the same name . In 2006 , it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary .
As with bacterial classification , identification of bacteria is increasingly using molecular methods . Diagnostics using DNA-based tools , such as polymerase chain reaction , are increasingly popular due to their specificity and speed , compared to culture-based methods . These methods also allow the detection and identification of " viable but nonculturable " cells that are metabolically active but non-dividing . However , even using these improved methods , the total number of bacterial species is not known and can not even be estimated with any certainty . Following present classification , there are a little less than 9,300 known species of prokaryotes , which includes bacteria and archaea ; but attempts to estimate the true number of bacterial diversity have ranged from 107 to 109 total species – and even these diverse estimates may be off by many orders of magnitude .
Alternatively , or in addition to this practice , the members of an upper house may be indirectly elected by the government or legislature of the component states , as occurred in the United States prior to 1913 , or be actual members or delegates of the state governments , as , for example , is the case in the German Bundesrat and in the Council of the European Union . The lower house of a federal legislature is usually directly elected , with apportionment in proportion to population , although states may sometimes still be guaranteed a certain minimum number of seats .
Several Germanic tribes celebrated the returning of the daylight . A predominant deity was during this jubilee driven around in a noisy procession on a ship on wheels . The winter would be driven out , to make sure that fertility could return in spring . A central figure was possibly the fertility goddess Nerthus . Also there are some indications that the effigy of Nerthus or Freyr was placed on a ship with wheels and accompanied by a procession of people in animal disguise and men in women 's clothes . Aboard the ship would the marriage of a man and woman be consummated as a fertility ritual .
Asphalt/bitumen can sometimes be confused with " coal tar " , which is a visually similar black , thermoplastic material produced by the destructive distillation of coal . During the early and mid-20th century when town gas was produced , coal tar was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates . The addition of tar to macadam roads led to the word tarmac , which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials . However , since the 1970s , when natural gas succeeded town gas , asphalt/bitumen has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications . Other examples of this confusion include the La Brea Tar Pits and the Canadian oil sands , both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar . Pitch is another term sometimes used at times to refer to asphalt/bitumen , as in Pitch Lake .
It is the third language of South Africa in terms of native speakers ( ~13.5 % ) , of whom 53 percent are Coloureds and 42.4 percent Whites . In 1996 , 40 percent of South Africans reported to know Afrikaans at least at a very basic level of communication . It is the lingua franca in Namibia , where it is spoken natively in 11 percent of households . In total , Afrikaans is the first language in South Africa alone of about 6.8 million people and is estimated to be a second language for at least 10 million people worldwide , compared to over 23 million and 5 million respectively , for Dutch .
Within the past ten years , the amount of social networking sites available to the public has greatly increased as well as the number of adolescents using them . Several sources report a high proportion of adolescents who use social media : 73 % of 12–17 year olds reported having at least one social networking profile ; two-thirds ( 68 % ) of teens text every day , half ( 51 % ) visit social networking sites daily , and 11 % send or receive tweets at least once every day . In fact , more than a third ( 34 % ) of teens visit their main social networking site several times a day . One in four ( 23 % ) teens are " heavy " social media users , meaning they use at least two different types of social media each and every day .
Uranium is a chemical element with symbol U and atomic number 92 . It is a silvery-white metal in the actinide series of the periodic table . A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons , of which 6 are valence electrons . Uranium is weakly radioactive because all its isotopes are unstable ( with half-lives of the six naturally known isotopes , uranium-233 to uranium-238 , varying between 69 years and 4.5 billion years ) . The most common isotopes of uranium are uranium-238 ( which has 146 neutrons and accounts for almost 99.3 % of the uranium found in nature ) and uranium-235 ( which has 143 neutrons , accounting for 0.7 % of the element found naturally ) . Uranium has the second highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements , lighter only than plutonium . Its density is about 70 % higher than that of lead , but slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten . It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil , rock and water , and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite .
The Siddi are an ethnic group inhabiting India and Pakistan whose members are descended from Bantu peoples from Southeast Africa that were brought to the Indian subcontinent as slaves by Arab and Portuguese merchants . Although it is commonly believed locally that " Siddi " derives from a word meaning " black " , the term is actually derived from " Sayyid " , the title borne by the captains of the Arab vessels that first brought Siddi settlers to the area . In the Makran strip of the Sindh and Balochistan provinces in southwestern Pakistan , these Bantu descendants are known as the Makrani . There was a brief " Black Power " movement in Sindh in the 1960s and many Siddi are proud of and celebrate their African ancestry .
Approximately 96.4 % of Ecuador 's Indigenous population are Highland Quichuas living in the valleys of the Sierra region . Primarily consisting of the descendents of Incans , they are Kichwa speakers and include the Caranqui , the Otavalos , the Cayambi , the Quitu-Caras , the Panzaleo , the Chimbuelo , the Salasacan , the Tugua , the Puruhá , the Cañari , and the Saraguro . Linguistic evidence suggests that the Salascan and the Saraguro may have been the descendants of Bolivian ethnic groups transplanted to Ecuador as mitimaes .
An FBI special agent is issued a Glock Model 22 pistol or a Glock 23 in .40 S & W caliber . If they fail their first qualification , they are issued either a Glock 17 or Glock 19 , to aid in their next qualification . In May 1997 , the FBI officially adopted the Glock .40 S & W pistol for general agent use and first issued it to New Agent Class 98-1 in October 1997 . At present , the Model 23 " FG & R " ( finger groove and rail ) is the issue sidearm . New agents are issued firearms , on which they must qualify , on successful completion of their training at the FBI Academy . The Glock 26 in 9×19mm Parabellum , and Glock Models 23 and 27 in .40 S & W caliber are authorized as secondary weapons . Special agents are authorized to purchase and qualify with the Glock Model 21 in .45 ACP . Special agents of the FBI HRT ( Hostage Rescue Team ) , and regional SWAT teams are issued the Springfield Professional Model 1911A1 .45 ACP pistol ( see FBI Special Weapons and Tactics Teams ) .
The First Intermediate Period ushered in a time of political upheaval for about 150 years . Stronger Nile floods and stabilisation of government , however , brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the Middle Kingdom c. 2040 BC , reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III . A second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt , that of the Semitic Hyksos . The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC and founded a new capital at Avaris . They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by Ahmose I , who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty and relocated the capital from Memphis to Thebes .
The Tanana Valley is another notable agricultural locus , especially the Delta Junction area , about 100 miles ( 160 km ) southeast of Fairbanks , with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops ; these farms mostly lie north and east of Fort Greely . This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor . Delta-area crops consist predominately of barley and hay . West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants , the hotel and tourist industry , and community-supported agriculture .
The first Jewish congregation in Richmond was Kahal Kadosh Beth Shalom . Kahal Kadosh Beth Shalom was the sixth congregation in the United States . By 1822 K.K . Beth Shalom members worshipped in the first synagogue building in Virginia . They eventually merged with Congregation Beth Ahabah , an offshoot of Beth Shalom . There are two Orthodox Synagogues , Keneseth Beth Israel and Chabad of Virginia . There is an Orthodox Yeshivah K–12 school system known as Rudlin Torah academy , which also includes a post high-school program . There are two Conservative synagogues , Beth El and Or Atid . There are three Reform synagogues , Bonay Kodesh , Beth Ahabah and Or Ami . Along with such religious congregations , there are a variety of other Jewish charitable , educational and social service institutions , each serving the Jewish and general communities . These include the Weinstein Jewish Community Center , Jewish Family Services , Jewish Community Federation of Richmond and Richmond Jewish Foundation .
The German Empire conquered Ukraine during World War I and was planning on either annexing it or installing a puppet king , but was defeated by the Entente , with major involvement by the Ukrainian Bolsheviks . After conquering the rest of Ukraine from the Whites , Ukraine joined the USSR and was enlarged ( gaining Crimea and then Eastern Galicia ) , whence a process of Ukrainization was begun , with encouragement from Moscow .
In terms of school casualties , thousands of school children died due to shoddy construction . In Mianyang City , seven schools collapsed , burying at least 1,700 people . At least 7,000 school buildings throughout the province collapsed . Another 700 students were buried in a school in Hanwang . At least 600 students and staff died at Juyuan Elementary School . Up to 1,300 children and teachers died at Beichuan Middle School .
The climate of the Cretaceous is less certain and more widely disputed . Higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are thought to have caused the world temperature gradient from north to south to become almost flat : temperatures were about the same across the planet . Average temperatures were also higher than today by about 10°C . In fact , by the middle Cretaceous , equatorial ocean waters ( perhaps as warm as 20 °C in the deep ocean ) may have been too warm for sea life , [ dubious – discuss ] [ citation needed ] and land areas near the equator may have been deserts despite their proximity to water . The circulation of oxygen to the deep ocean may also have been disrupted . [ dubious – discuss ] For this reason , large volumes of organic matter that was unable to decompose accumulated , eventually being deposited as " black shale " .
Nick Fradiani won the season , defeating Clark Beckham . By winning , Fradiani became the first winner from the Northeast region . Fradiani released " Beautiful Life " as his coronation single while Beckham released " Champion " . Jax , the third place finalist , also released a single called " Forcefield " .
In 1992 , Yitzhak Rabin became Prime Minister following an election in which his party called for compromise with Israel 's neighbors . The following year , Shimon Peres on behalf of Israel , and Mahmoud Abbas for the PLO , signed the Oslo Accords , which gave the Palestinian National Authority the right to govern parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . The PLO also recognized Israel 's right to exist and pledged an end to terrorism . In 1994 , the Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace was signed , making Jordan the second Arab country to normalize relations with Israel . Arab public support for the Accords was damaged by the continuation of Israeli settlements and checkpoints , and the deterioration of economic conditions . Israeli public support for the Accords waned as Israel was struck by Palestinian suicide attacks . Finally , while leaving a peace rally in November 1995 , Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a far-right-wing Jew who opposed the Accords .
In its 2014 Press Freedom Index , Reporters Without Borders ranked the media environment in Eritrea at the very bottom of a list of 178 countries , just below totalitarian North Korea . According to the BBC , " Eritrea is the only African country to have no privately owned news media " , and Reporters Without Borders said of the public media , " [ they ] do nothing but relay the regime 's belligerent and ultra-nationalist discourse . ... Not a single [ foreign correspondent ] now lives in Asmara . " The state-owned news agency censors news about external events . Independent media have been banned since 2001 . In 2015 , The Guardian published an opinion piece claiming ,
Dutch belongs to its own West Germanic sub-group , West Low Franconian , paired with its sister language Limburgish , or East Low Franconian . Closest relative is the mutual intelligible daughter language Afrikaans . Other West Germanic languages related to Dutch are German , English and the Frisian languages , and the non standardised languages Low German and Yiddish . Dutch stands out in combining a small degree of Ingvaeonic characteristics ( occurring consistently in English and Frisian and reduced in intensity from 'west to east ' over the continental West Germanic plane ) with mostly Istvaeonic characteristics , of which some of them are also incorporated in German . Unlike German , Dutch ( apart from Limburgish ) has not been influenced at all by the 'south to north ' movement of the High German sound shift , and had some changes of its own . The cumulation of these changes resulted over time in separate , but related standard languages with various degrees of similarities and differences between them . For a comparison between the West Germanic languages , see the sections Morphology , Grammar and Vocabulary .
In late December , Barcelona 's appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport was unsuccessful and the original transfer ban was reinstated , leaving the club unable to utilise the 2015 winter and summer transfer windows . On 5 January 2015 , Zubizareta was sacked by the board after 4 years as director of football . The next month , Barcelona announced the formation of a new Football Area Technical Commission , made up of vice-president Jordi Mestre , board member Javier Bordas , Carles Rexach and Ariedo Braida .
The 5th Dalai Lama is known for unifying the Tibetan heartland under the control of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism , after defeating the rival Kagyu and Jonang sects and the secular ruler , the Tsangpa prince , in a prolonged civil war . His efforts were successful in part because of aid from Güshi Khan , the Oirat leader of the Khoshut Khanate . With Güshi Khan as a largely uninvolved overlord , the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates established a civil administration which is referred to by historians as the Lhasa state . This Tibetan regime or government is also referred to as the Ganden Phodrang .
Victoria later described her childhood as " rather melancholy " . Her mother was extremely protective , and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called " Kensington System " , an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller , Sir John Conroy , who was rumoured to be the Duchess 's lover . The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable ( including most of her father 's family ) , and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them . The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William 's bastard children , and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety . Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night , studied with private tutors to a regular timetable , and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel , Dash . Her lessons included French , German , Italian , and Latin , but she spoke only English at home .
A test given to new students by Stanford University Music Professor Jonathan Berger showed that student preference for MP3-quality music has risen each year . Berger said the students seem to prefer the 'sizzle ' sounds that MP3s bring to music .
The Feynman Lectures on Physics is perhaps his most accessible work for anyone with an interest in physics , compiled from lectures to Caltech undergraduates in 1961–64 . As news of the lectures ' lucidity grew , professional physicists and graduate students began to drop in to listen . Co-authors Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands , colleagues of Feynman , edited and illustrated them into book form . The work has endured and is useful to this day . They were edited and supplemented in 2005 with " Feynman 's Tips on Physics : A Problem-Solving Supplement to the Feynman Lectures on Physics " by Michael Gottlieb and Ralph Leighton ( Robert Leighton 's son ) , with support from Kip Thorne and other physicists .
Roofs are traditionally constructed from Alpine rocks such as pieces of schist , gneiss or slate . Such chalets are typically found in the higher parts of the valleys , as in the Maurienne valley in Savoy , where the amount of snow during the cold months is important . The inclination of the roof can not exceed 40 % , allowing the snow to stay on top , thereby functioning as insulation from the cold . In the lower areas where the forests are widespread , wooden tiles are traditionally used . Commonly made of Norway spruce , they are called " tavaillon " . The Alpine regions are multicultural and linguistically diverse . Dialects are common , and vary from valley to valley and region to region . In the Slavic Alps alone 19 dialects have been identified . Some of the French dialects spoken in the French , Swiss and Italian alps of Aosta Valley derive from Arpitan , while the southern part of the western range is related to Old Provençal ; the German dialects derive from Germanic tribal languages . Romansh , spoken by two percent of the population in southeast Switzerland , is an ancient Rhaeto-Romanic language derived from Latin , remnants of ancient Celtic languages and perhaps Etruscan .
On December 15 , 2012 , several news outlets reported that President Barack Obama would nominate Kerry to succeed Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State , after Susan Rice , widely seen as Obama 's preferred choice , withdrew her name from consideration citing a politicized confirmation process following criticism of her response to the 2012 Benghazi attack . On December 21 , Obama proposed the nomination which received positive commentary . His confirmation hearing took place on January 24 , 2013 , before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , the same panel where he first testified in 1971 . The committee unanimously voted to approve him on January 29 , 2013 , and the same day the full Senate confirmed him on a vote of 94–3 . In a letter to Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick , Kerry announced his resignation from the Senate effective February 1 .
Cork is home to one of Ireland 's main national newspapers , the Irish Examiner ( formerly the Cork Examiner ) . It also prints the Evening Echo , which for decades has been connected to the Echo Boys , who were poor and often homeless children who sold the newspaper . Today , the shouts of the vendors selling the Echo can still be heard in various parts of the city centre . One of the biggest free newspapers in the city is the Cork Independent . The city 's University publishes the UCC Express and Motley magazine .
The Mīmāṃsā school has several subschools defined by epistemology . The Prābhākara subschool of Mīmāṃsā considered five epistemically reliable means to gaining knowledge : pratyakṣa ( perception ) , anumāṇa ( inference ) , upamāṇa ( comparison and analogy ) , arthāpatti ( postulation , derivation from circumstances ) , and śabda ( word , testimony of past or present reliable experts ) . The Kumārila Bhaṭṭa sub-school of Mīmāṃsā added sixth to its canon of reliable epistemology - anupalabdi ( non-perception , negative/cognitive proof ) .
When the act is assented to by the sovereign in person , or by empowered Royal Commissioners , royal assent is considered given at the moment when the assent is declared in the presence of both houses jointly assembled . When the procedure created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 is followed , assent is considered granted when the presiding officers of both houses , having received the letters patent from the king or queen signifying the assent , have notified their respective house of the grant of royal assent . Thus , if each presiding officer makes the announcement at a different time ( for instance because one house is not sitting on a certain date ) , assent is regarded as effective when the second announcement is made . This is important because , under British Law , unless there is any provision to the contrary , an act takes effect on the date on which it receives royal assent and that date is not regarded as being the date when the letters patent are signed , or when they are delivered to the presiding officers of each house , but the date on which both houses have been formally acquainted of the assent .
From November 17 , 1947 to December 23 , 1947 , John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at AT & T 's Bell Labs in the United States performed experiments and observed that when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium , a signal was produced with the output power greater than the input . Solid State Physics Group leader William Shockley saw the potential in this , and over the next few months worked to greatly expand the knowledge of semiconductors . The term transistor was coined by John R. Pierce as a contraction of the term transresistance . According to Lillian Hoddeson and Vicki Daitch , authors of a biography of John Bardeen , Shockley had proposed that Bell Labs ' first patent for a transistor should be based on the field-effect and that he be named as the inventor . Having unearthed Lilienfeld’s patents that went into obscurity years earlier , lawyers at Bell Labs advised against Shockley 's proposal because the idea of a field-effect transistor that used an electric field as a " grid " was not new . Instead , what Bardeen , Brattain , and Shockley invented in 1947 was the first point-contact transistor . In acknowledgement of this accomplishment , Shockley , Bardeen , and Brattain were jointly awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics " for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect . "
In 1978 , Sewall Wright suggested that human populations that have long inhabited separated parts of the world should , in general , be considered different subspecies by the usual criterion that most individuals of such populations can be allocated correctly by inspection . Wright argued that it does not require a trained anthropologist to classify an array of Englishmen , West Africans , and Chinese with 100 % accuracy by features , skin color , and type of hair despite so much variability within each of these groups that every individual can easily be distinguished from every other . However , it is customary to use the term race rather than subspecies for the major subdivisions of the human species as well as for minor ones .
Canada also permits a variety of charities ( including public and private foundations ) . Charitable status is granted by the Canada Revenue Agency ( CRA ) upon application by a nonprofit ; charities are allowed to issue income tax receipts to donors , must spend a certain percentage of their assets ( including cash , investments and fixed assets ) and file annual reports in order to maintain their charitable status . In determining whether an organization can become a charity , CRA applies a common law test to its stated objects and activities . These must be :
Insect ecology is the scientific study of how insects , individually or as a community , interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem . :3 Insects play one of the most important roles in their ecosystems , which includes many roles , such as soil turning and aeration , dung burial , pest control , pollination and wildlife nutrition . An example is the beetles , which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms . These insects , and others , are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created . :3 , 218–228
The Blue Ridge Mountains , rising in southern Pennsylvania and there known as South Mountain , attain elevations of about 2,000 ft ( 600 m ) in that state . South Mountain achieves its highest point just below the Mason-Dixon line in Maryland at Quirauk Mountain 2,145 ft ( 654 m ) and then diminishes in height southward to the Potomac River . Once in Virginia the Blue Ridge again reaches 2,000 ft ( 600 m ) and higher . In the Virginia Blue Ridge , the following are some of the highest peaks north of the Roanoke River : Stony Man 4,031 ft ( 1,229 m ) , Hawksbill Mountain 4,066 ft ( 1,239 m ) , Apple Orchard Mountain 4,225 ft ( 1,288 m ) and Peaks of Otter 4,001 and 3,875 ft ( 1,220 and 1,181 m ) . South of the Roanoke River , along the Blue Ridge , are Virginia 's highest peaks including Whitetop Mountain 5,520 ft ( 1,680 m ) and Mount Rogers 5,729 ft ( 1,746 m ) , the highest point in the Commonwealth .
Josip Broz was born on 7 May 1892 in Kumrovec , in the northern Croatian region of Hrvatsko Zagorje in Austria-Hungary . [ nb 1 ] He was the seventh child of Franjo and Marija Broz . His father , Franjo Broz ( 26 November 1860 – 16 December 1936 ) , was a Croat , while his mother Marija ( 25 March 1864 – 14 January 1918 ) , was a Slovene . His parents were married on 21 January 1891 . After spending part of his childhood years with his maternal grandfather Martin Javeršek in the Slovenian village of Podsreda , he entered primary school in 1900 at Kumrovec , he failed the 2nd grade and graduated in 1905 . In 1907 he moved out of the rural environment and started working as a machinist 's apprentice in Sisak . There , he became aware of the labour movement and celebrated 1 May – Labour Day for the first time . In 1910 , he joined the union of metallurgy workers and at the same time the Social-Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia . Between 1911 and 1913 , Broz worked for shorter periods in Kamnik ( 1911–1912 , factory " Titan " ) , Cenkov , Munich and Mannheim , where he worked for the Benz car factory ; then he went to Wiener Neustadt , Austria , and worked as a test driver for Daimler .
Besides the city wall , other famous Ming-era structures in the city included the famous Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and Porcelain Tower , although the latter was destroyed by the Taipings in the 19th century either in order to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its geomantic properties .
DST has mixed effects on health . In societies with fixed work schedules it provides more afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise . It alters sunlight exposure ; whether this is beneficial depends on one 's location and daily schedule , as sunlight triggers vitamin D synthesis in the skin , but overexposure can lead to skin cancer . DST may help in depression by causing individuals to rise earlier , but some argue the reverse . The Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness , chaired by blind sports magnate Gordon Gund , successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for US DST extensions .
Central Catalan is considered the standard pronunciation of the language . The descriptions below are mostly for this variety . For the differences in pronunciation of the different dialects , see the section pronunciation of dialects in this article .
Since 1875 , with the strengthening of self-rule , the urban and rural districts ( Kreise ) within each province ( sometimes within each governorate ) formed a corporation with common tasks and assets ( schools , traffic installations , hospitals , cultural institutions , jails etc . ) called the Provinzialverband ( provincial association ) . Initially the assemblies of the urban and rural districts elected representatives for the provincial diets ( Provinziallandtage ) , which were thus indirectly elected . As of 1919 the provincial diets ( or as to governorate diets , the so-called Kommunallandtage ) were directly elected by the citizens of the provinces ( or governorates , respectively ) . These parliaments legislated within the competences transferred to the provincial associations . The provincial diet of East Prussia elected a provincial executive body ( government ) , the provincial committee ( Provinzialausschuss ) , and a head of province , the Landeshauptmann ( " Land Captain " ; till the 1880s titled Landdirektor , land director ) .
Chanakya , 4th Century BC Indian political philosopher . The Arthashastra provides an account of the science of politics for a wise ruler , policies for foreign affairs and wars , the system of a spy state and surveillance and economic stability of the state . Chanakya quotes several authorities including Bruhaspati , Ushanas , Prachetasa Manu , Parasara , and Ambi , and described himself as a descendant of a lineage of political philosophers , with his father Chanaka being his immediate predecessor . Another influential extant Indian treatise on political philosophy is the Sukra Neeti . An example of a code of law in ancient India is the Manusmṛti or Laws of Manu .
Avicenna 's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being ; namely impossibility , contingency , and necessity . Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which can not exist , while the contingent in itself ( mumkin bi-dhatihi ) has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction . When actualized , the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself ' ( wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi ) . Thus , contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself . The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different . Necessary being due to itself ( wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi ) is true in itself , while the contingent being is 'false in itself ' and 'true due to something else other than itself ' . The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence . It is what always exists .

The current mayor of Houston is Sylvester Turner , a Democrat elected on a nonpartisan ballot . Houston 's mayor serves as the city 's chief administrator , executive officer , and official representative , and is responsible for the general management of the city and for seeing that all laws and ordinances are enforced .
Dog intelligence is the ability of the dog to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems . Dogs have been shown to learn by inference . A study with Rico showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items . He inferred the names of novel items by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those novel items immediately and also 4 weeks after the initial exposure . Dogs have advanced memory skills . A study documented the learning and memory capabilities of a border collie , " Chaser " , who had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words . Dogs are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing , and to understand human voice commands . Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception . A study showed compelling evidence that Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving experiment , indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans . Another study indicated that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task , dogs that are faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human , while socialized wolves do not . Modern domestic dogs use humans to solve their problems for them .
In Latin America in the 1970s , leftists acquired a significant political influence which prompted the right-wing , ecclesiastical authorities and a large portion of the individual country 's upper class to support coup d'états to avoid what they perceived as a communist threat . This was further fueled by Cuban and United States intervention which led to a political polarization . Most South American countries were in some periods ruled by military dictatorships that were supported by the United States of America . In the 1970s , the regimes of the Southern Cone collaborated in Operation Condor killing many leftist dissidents , including some urban guerrillas . However , by the early 1990s all countries had restored their democracies .
However , since the end of the Cold War , as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) has moved much of its defence focus " out of area " , the Canadian military has also become more deeply engaged in international security operations in various other parts of the world – most notably in Afghanistan since 2002 .
Assuming the player 's optical pickup is in proper working order , crosstalk distortion normally does not occur during playback of CAV format LaserDiscs , as the rotational speed never varies . However , if the player calibration is out of order or if the CAV disc is faulty or damaged , other problems affecting tracking accuracy can occur . One such problem is " laser lock " , where the player reads the same two fields for a given frame over and over again , causing the picture to look frozen as if the movie were paused .
During the Minor Occultation ( Ghaybat al-Sughrá ) , it is believed that al-Mahdi maintained contact with his followers via deputies ( Arab . an-nuwāb al-arbaʻa or " the Four Leaders " ) . They represented him and acted as agents between him and his followers . Whenever the believers faced a problem , they would write their concerns and send them to his deputy . The deputy would ascertain his verdict , endorse it with his seal and signature and return it to the relevant parties . The deputies also collected zakat and khums on his behalf .
The earliest disc records ( 1889–1894 ) were made of various materials including hard rubber . Around 1895 , a shellac-based compound was introduced and became standard . Exact formulas for this compound varied by manufacturer and over the course of time , but it was typically composed of about one-third shellac and about two-thirds mineral filler , which meant finely pulverized rock , usually slate and limestone , with an admixture of cotton fibers to add tensile strength , carbon black for color ( without this , it tended to be a " dirty " gray or brown color that most record companies considered unattractive ) , and a very small amount of a lubricant to facilitate mold release during manufacture . Some makers , notably Columbia Records , used a laminated construction with a core disc of coarser material or fiber . The production of shellac records continued until the end of the 78 rpm format ( i.e. , the late 1950s in most developed countries , but well into the 1960s in some other places ) , but increasingly less abrasive formulations were used during its declining years and very late examples in truly like-new condition can have as low noise levels as vinyl .
Downtown Miami is home to the largest concentration of international banks in the United States , and many large national and international companies . The Civic Center is a major center for hospitals , research institutes , medical centers , and biotechnology industries . For more than two decades , the Port of Miami , known as the " Cruise Capital of the World " , has been the number one cruise passenger port in the world . It accommodates some of the world 's largest cruise ships and operations , and is the busiest port in both passenger traffic and cruise lines .
The Suez Canal , built in partnership with the French , was completed in 1869 . Its construction led to enormous debt to European banks , and caused popular discontent because of the onerous taxation it required . In 1875 Ismail was forced to sell Egypt 's share in the canal to the British Government . Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French controllers who sat in the Egyptian cabinet , and , " with the financial power of the bondholders behind them , were the real power in the Government . "
They invented and developed arithmetic by using several different number systems including a mixed radix system with an alternating base 10 and base 6 . This sexagesimal system became the standard number system in Sumer and Babylonia . They may have invented military formations and introduced the basic divisions between infantry , cavalry , and archers . They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems , complete with courts , jails , and government records . The first true city-states arose in Sumer , roughly contemporaneously with similar entities in what are now Syria and Lebanon . Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform , the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for the first time , about 2600 BC , to messages and mail delivery , history , legend , mathematics , astronomical records , and other pursuits . Conjointly with the spread of writing , the first formal schools were established , usually under the auspices of a city-state 's primary temple .
Czech continued to evolve and gain in regional importance for hundreds of years , and has been a literary language in the Slovak lands since the early fifteenth century . A biblical translation , the Kralice Bible , was published during the late sixteenth century ( around the time of the King James and Luther versions ) which was more linguistically conservative than either . The publication of the Kralice Bible spawned widespread nationalism , and in 1615 the government of Bohemia ruled that only Czech-speaking residents would be allowed to become full citizens or inherit goods or land . This , and the conversion of the Czech upper classes from the Habsburg Empire 's Catholicism to Protestantism , angered the Habsburgs and helped trigger the Thirty Years ' War ( where the Czechs were defeated at the Battle of White Mountain ) . The Czechs became serfs ; Bohemia 's printing industry ( and its linguistic and political rights ) were dismembered , removing official regulation and support from its language . German quickly became the dominant language in Bohemia .
Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30 . It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table . In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium : its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2 . Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth 's crust and has five stable isotopes . The most common zinc ore is sphalerite ( zinc blende ) , a zinc sulfide mineral . The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia , Asia , and the United States . Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore , roasting , and final extraction using electricity ( electrowinning ) .
Viking invasions began in the 9th century , followed by more permanent settlements , particularly along the east coast of Ireland , the west coast of modern-day Scotland and the Isle of Man . Though the Vikings were eventually neutralised in Ireland , their influence remained in the cities of Dublin , Cork , Limerick , Waterford and Wexford . England however was slowly conquered around the turn of the first millennium AD , and eventually became a feudal possession of Denmark . The relations between the descendants of Vikings in England and counterparts in Normandy , in northern France , lay at the heart of a series of events that led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066 . The remnants of the Duchy of Normandy , which conquered England , remain associated to the English Crown as the Channel Islands to this day . A century later the marriage of the future Henry II of England to Eleanor of Aquitaine created the Angevin Empire , partially under the French Crown . At the invitation of a provincial king and under the authority of Pope Adrian IV ( the only Englishman to be elected pope ) , the Angevins invaded Ireland in 1169 . Though initially intended to be kept as an independent kingdom , the failure of the Irish High King to ensure the terms of the Treaty of Windsor led Henry II , as King of England , to rule as effective monarch under the title of Lord of Ireland . This title was granted to his younger son but when Henry 's heir unexpectedly died the title of King of England and Lord of Ireland became entwined in one person .
According to the U.S. Census Bureau , as of 2015 , Tennessee had an estimated population of 6,600,299 , which is an increase of 50,947 , from the prior year and an increase of 254,194 , or 4.01 % , since the year 2010 . This includes a natural increase since the last census of 142,266 people ( that is 493,881 births minus 351,615 deaths ) , and an increase from net migration of 219,551 people into the state . Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 59,385 people , and migration within the country produced a net increase of 160,166 people . Twenty percent of Tennesseans were born outside the South in 2008 , compared to a figure of 13.5 % in 1990 .
Guinea-Bissau is a member of the United Nations , African Union , Economic Community of West African States , Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , the Latin Union , Community of Portuguese Language Countries , La Francophonie and the South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone .
Family history is a risk factor for asthma , with many different genes being implicated . If one identical twin is affected , the probability of the other having the disease is approximately 25 % . By the end of 2005 , 25 genes had been associated with asthma in six or more separate populations , including GSTM1 , IL10 , CTLA-4 , SPINK5 , LTC4S , IL4R and ADAM33 , among others . Many of these genes are related to the immune system or modulating inflammation . Even among this list of genes supported by highly replicated studies , results have not been consistent among all populations tested . In 2006 over 100 genes were associated with asthma in one genetic association study alone ; more continue to be found .
In London Chopin took lodgings at Dover Street , where the firm of Broadwood provided him with a grand piano . At his first engagement , on 15 May at Stafford House , the audience included Queen Victoria and Prince Albert . The Prince , who was himself a talented musician , moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin 's technique . Broadwood also arranged concerts for him ; among those attending were Thackeray and the singer Jenny Lind . Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons , for which he charged the high fee of one guinea ( £1.05 in present British currency ) per hour , and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas . At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot , who sang arrangements of some of his mazurkas to Spanish texts .
On April 22 , 1971 , Kerry appeared before a U.S. Senate committee hearing on proposals relating to ending the war . The day after this testimony , Kerry participated in a demonstration with thousands of other veterans in which he and other Vietnam War veterans threw their medals and service ribbons over a fence erected at the front steps of the United States Capitol building to dramatize their opposition to the war . Jack Smith , a Marine , read a statement explaining why the veterans were returning their military awards to the government . For more than two hours , almost 1000 angry veterans tossed their medals , ribbons , hats , jackets , and military papers over the fence . Each veteran gave his or her name , hometown , branch of service and a statement . Kerry threw some of his own decorations and awards as well as some given to him by other veterans to throw . As Kerry threw his decorations over the fence , his statement was : " I 'm not doing this for any violent reasons , but for peace and justice , and to try and make this country wake up once and for all . "
On Sentinel Peak ( also known as " 'A ' Mountain " ) , just west of downtown , there is a giant " A " in honor of the University of Arizona . Starting in about 1916 , a yearly tradition developed for freshmen to whitewash the " A " , which was visible for miles . However , at the beginning of the Iraq War , anti-war activists painted it black . This was followed by a paint scuffle where the " A " was painted various colors until the city council intervened . It is now red , white and blue except when it is white or another color decided by a biennial election . Because of the three-color paint scheme often used , the shape of the A can be vague and indistinguishable from the rest of the peak . The top of Sentinel Peak , which is accessible by road , offers an outstanding scenic view of the city looking eastward . A parking lot located near the summit of Sentinel Peak was formerly a popular place to watch sunsets or view the city lights at night .
Under the Capetian dynasty France slowly began to expand its authority over the nobility , growing out of the Île-de-France to exert control over more of the country in the 11th and 12th centuries . They faced a powerful rival in the Dukes of Normandy , who in 1066 under William the Conqueror ( duke 1035–1087 ) , conquered England ( r. 1066–87 ) and created a cross-channel empire that lasted , in various forms , throughout the rest of the Middle Ages . Normans also settled in Sicily and southern Italy , when Robert Guiscard ( d. 1085 ) landed there in 1059 and established a duchy that later became the Kingdom of Sicily . Under the Angevin dynasty of Henry II ( r. 1154–89 ) and his son Richard I ( r. 1189–99 ) , the kings of England ruled over England and large areas of France , [ W ] brought to the family by Henry II 's marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine ( d. 1204 ) , heiress to much of southern France . [ X ] Richard 's younger brother John ( r. 1199–1216 ) lost Normandy and the rest of the northern French possessions in 1204 to the French King Philip II Augustus ( r. 1180–1223 ) . This led to dissension among the English nobility , while John 's financial exactions to pay for his unsuccessful attempts to regain Normandy led in 1215 to Magna Carta , a charter that confirmed the rights and privileges of free men in England . Under Henry III ( r. 1216–72 ) , John 's son , further concessions were made to the nobility , and royal power was diminished . The French monarchy continued to make gains against the nobility during the late 12th and 13th centuries , bringing more territories within the kingdom under their personal rule and centralising the royal administration . Under Louis IX ( r. 1226–70 ) , royal prestige rose to new heights as Louis served as a mediator for most of Europe . [ Y ]
Much of the current knowledge of memory has come from studying memory disorders , particularly amnesia . Loss of memory is known as amnesia . Amnesia can result from extensive damage to : ( a ) the regions of the medial temporal lobe , such as the hippocampus , dentate gyrus , subiculum , amygdala , the parahippocampal , entorhinal , and perirhinal cortices or the ( b ) midline diencephalic region , specifically the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus . There are many sorts of amnesia , and by studying their different forms , it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub-systems of the brain 's memory systems , and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain . Other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer 's disease and Parkinson 's disease can also affect memory and cognition . Hyperthymesia , or hyperthymesic syndrome , is a disorder that affects an individual 's autobiographical memory , essentially meaning that they can not forget small details that otherwise would not be stored . Korsakoff 's syndrome , also known as Korsakoff 's psychosis , amnesic-confabulatory syndrome , is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex .
Typical of Slavic languages , Czech marks its verbs for one of two grammatical aspects : perfective and imperfective . Most verbs are part of inflected aspect pairs—for example , koupit ( perfective ) and kupovat ( imperfective ) . Although the verbs ' meaning is similar , in perfective verbs the action is completed and in imperfective verbs it is ongoing . This is distinct from past and present tense , and any Czech verb of either aspect can be conjugated into any of its three tenses . Aspect describes the state of the action at the time specified by the tense .
Cesare Beccaria , a jurist and one of the great Enlightenment writers , became famous for his masterpiece Of Crimes and Punishments ( 1764 ) , which was later translated into 22 languages . Another prominent intellectual was Francesco Mario Pagano , who wrote important studies such as Saggi Politici ( Political Essays , 1783 ) , one of the major works of the Enlightenment in Naples , and Considerazioni sul processo criminale ( Considerations on the criminal trial , 1787 ) , which established him as an international authority on criminal law .
Efforts have been made to improve nutrition , and reduce associated health problems , by encouraging women to make nutritious versions of local recipes . For example , the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics ( ICRISAT ) and the Aga Khan Foundation , trained women 's groups to make equinut , a healthy and nutritional version of the traditional recipe di-dèguè ( comprising peanut paste , honey and millet or rice flour ) . The aim was to boost nutrition and livelihoods by producing a product that women could make and sell , and which would be accepted by the local community because of its local heritage .
Treaties are not necessarily permanently binding upon the signatory parties . As obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states , many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification . For example , the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs provides that the treaty will terminate if , as a result of denunciations , the number of parties falls below 40 . Many treaties expressly forbid withdrawal . Article 56 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that where a treaty is silent over whether or not it can be denounced there is a rebuttable presumption that it can not be unilaterally denounced unless :
In England , the 16th-century European Reformation resulted in a number of executions on charges of heresy . During the thirty-eight years of Henry VIII 's reign , about sixty heretics , mainly Protestants , were executed and a rather greater number of Catholics lost their lives on grounds of political offences such as treason , notably Sir Thomas More and Cardinal John Fisher , for refusing to accept the king 's supremacy over the Church in England . Under Edward VI , the heresy laws were repealed in 1547 only to be reintroduced in 1554 by Mary I ; even so two radicals were executed in Edward 's reign ( one for denying the reality of the incarnation , the other for denying Christ 's divinity ) . Under Mary , around two hundred and ninety people were burned at the stake between 1555 and 1558 after the restoration of papal jurisdiction . When Elizabeth I came to the throne , the concept of heresy was retained in theory but severely restricted by the 1559 Act of Supremacy and the one hundred and eighty or so Catholics who were executed in the forty-five years of her reign were put to death because they were considered members of " ... a subversive fifth column . " The last execution of a " heretic " in England occurred under James VI and I in 1612 . Although the charge was technically one of " blasphemy " there was one later execution in Scotland ( still at that date an entirely independent kingdom ) when in 1697 Thomas Aikenhead was accused , among other things , of denying the doctrine of the Trinity .
The United Nations formulates multiple regional divisions as is convenient for its various operations . But few of them include a Near East , and that poorly defined . UNICEF recognizes the " Middle East and North Africa " region , where the Middle East is bounded by the Red Sea on the west and includes Iran on the east . UNESCO recognizes neither a Near East nor a Middle East , dividing the countries instead among three regions : Arab States , Asia and the Pacific , and Africa . Its division " does not forcibly reflect geography " but " refers to the execution of regional activities . " The United Nations Statistics Division defines Western Asia to contain the countries included elsewhere in the Middle East . The Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) describes its entire theatre of operations as the Near East , but then assigns many of its members to other regions as well ; for example , Cyprus , Malta and Turkey are in both the European and the Near Eastern regions . Its total area extends further into Central Asia than that of most agencies .
Differences in pain perception and tolerance thresholds are associated with , among other factors , ethnicity , genetics , and sex . People of Mediterranean origin report as painful some radiant heat intensities that northern Europeans describe as nonpainful . And Italian women tolerate less intense electric shock than Jewish or Native American women . Some individuals in all cultures have significantly higher than normal pain perception and tolerance thresholds . For instance , patients who experience painless heart attacks have higher pain thresholds for electric shock , muscle cramp and heat .
Public notice is given through legal notices in newspapers , and communicated to state and county agencies within the species ' area . Foreign nations may also receive notice of a listing . A public hearing is mandatory if any person has requested one within 45 days of the published notice . " The purpose of the notice and comment requirement is to provide for meaningful public participation in the rulemaking process . " summarized the Ninth Circuit court in the case of Idaho Farm Bureau Federation v. Babbitt .
Horizontal gene transfer is invoked to explain how there is often extreme similarity between small portions of the genomes of two organisms that are otherwise very distantly related . Horizontal gene transfer seems to be common among many microbes . Also , eukaryotic cells seem to have experienced a transfer of some genetic material from their chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes to their nuclear chromosomes .
Muslim rule started in parts of north India in the 13th century when the Delhi Sultanate was founded in 1206 CE by the Central Asian Turks . The Delhi Sultanate ruled the major part of northern India in the early 14th century , but declined in the late 14th century when several powerful Hindu states such as the Vijayanagara Empire , Gajapati Kingdom , Ahom Kingdom , as well as Rajput dynasties and states , such as Mewar dynasty , emerged . The 15th century saw the emergence of Sikhism . In the 16th century , Mughals came from Central Asia and gradually covered most of India . The Mughal Empire suffered a gradual decline in the early 18th century , which provided opportunities for the Maratha Empire , Sikh Empire and Mysore Kingdom to exercise control over large areas of the subcontinent .
Sultan Quli , a governor of Golkonda , revolted against the Bahmani Sultanate and established the Qutb Shahi dynasty in 1518 ; he rebuilt the mud-fort of Golconda and named the city " Muhammad nagar " . The fifth sultan , Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah , established Hyderabad on the banks of the Musi River in 1591 , to avoid the water shortages experienced at Golkonda . During his rule , he had the Charminar and Mecca Masjid built in the city . On 21 September 1687 , the Golkonda Sultanate came under the rule of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb after a year-long siege of the Golkonda fort . The annexed area was renamed Deccan Suba ( Deccan province ) and the capital was moved from Golkonda to Aurangabad , about 550 km ( 342 mi ) northwest of Hyderabad .
In 1930 , Paul Dirac proposed a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles possessing negative energy , called the Dirac sea . This theory helped refine the predictions of his earlier formulated Dirac equation , and successfully predicted the existence of the positron , confirmed two years later . Werner Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle formulated in 1927 , predict a fundamental limit within which instantaneous position and momentum , or energy and time can be measured . This has far reaching consequences on the " emptiness " of space between particles . In the late 20th century , so-called virtual particles that arise spontaneously from empty space were confirmed .
In the Mexico City airport , the government engaged in an extensive restructuring program that includes the addition of a new second terminal , which began operations in 2007 , and the enlargement of four other airports ( at the nearby cities of Toluca , Querétaro , Puebla and Cuernavaca ) that , along with Mexico City 's airport , comprise the Grupo Aeroportuario del Valle de México , distributing traffic to different regions in Mexico . The city of Pachuca will also provide additional expansion to central Mexico 's airport network . Mexico City 's airport is the main hub for 11 of the 21 national airline companies .
Given the potential consequences , engaging in sexual behavior is somewhat risky , particularly for adolescents . Having unprotected sex , using poor birth control methods ( e.g . withdrawal ) , having multiple sexual partners , and poor communication are some aspects of sexual behavior that increase individual and/or social risk . Some qualities of adolescents ' lives that are often correlated with risky sexual behavior include higher rates of experienced abuse , lower rates of parental support and monitoring . Adolescence is also commonly a time of questioning sexuality and gender . This may involve intimate experimentation with people identifying as the same gender as well as with people of differing genders . Such exploratory sexual behavior can be seen as similar to other aspects of identity , including the exploration of vocational , social , and leisure identity , all of which involve some risk .
Idol Gives Back is a special charity event started in season six featuring performances by celebrities and various fund-raising initiatives . This event was also held in seasons seven and nine and has raised nearly $ 185 million in total .
During the American occupation of the state , the number of Indian attacks was drastically reduced , but in 1848 the attacks resumed to such a degree that the Mexican officials had no choice but to resume military projects to protect Mexican settlements in the state . Through the next three decades the state faced constant attacks from indigenous on Mexican settlements . After the occupation the people of the state were worried about the potential attack from the hostile indigenous tribes north of the Rio Grande ; as a result a decree on July 19 , 1848 , the state established 18 military colonies along the Rio Grande . The new military colonies were to replace the presidios as population centers to prevent future invasions by indigenous tribes ; these policies remained prominent in the state until 1883 . Eventually the state replaced the old state security with a state policy to form militias organized with every Mexican in the state capable to serve between the ages of 18 and 55 to fulfill the mandate of having six men defending for every 1000 residents .
The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general , and not solely from having dogs as pets . For example , when in the presence of a pet dog , people show reductions in cardiovascular , behavioral , and psychological indicators of anxiety . Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms , which , according to the hygiene hypothesis , can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases . The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support , as dogs are able to not only provide companionship and social support themselves , but also to act as facilitators of social interactions between humans . One study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when they are accompanied by a dog than when they are not . In 2015 , a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet owners .
By 1820 , Charleston 's population had grown to 23,000 , maintaining its black ( and mostly slave ) majority . When a massive slave revolt planned by Denmark Vesey , a free black , was revealed in May 1822 , whites reacted with intense fear , as they were well aware of the violent retribution of slaves against whites during the Haitian Revolution . Soon after , Vesey was tried and executed , hanged in early July with five slaves . Another 28 slaves were later hanged . Later , the state legislature passed laws requiring individual legislative approval for manumission ( the freeing of a slave ) and regulating activities of free blacks and slaves .
The Scottish traveler James Bruce reported in 1770 that Medri Bahri was a distinct political entity from Abyssinia , noting that the two territories were frequently in conflict . The Bahre-Nagassi ( " Kings of the Sea " ) alternately fought with or against the Abyssinians and the neighbouring Muslim Adal Sultanate depending on the geopolitical circumstances . Medri Bahri was thus part of the Christian resistance against Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi of Adal 's forces , but later joined the Adalite states and the Ottoman Empire front against Abyssinia in 1572 . That 16th century also marked the arrival of the Ottomans , who began making inroads in the Red Sea area .
The majority of studies indicate antibiotics do interfere with contraceptive pills , such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low ( about 1 % ) . In cases where antibacterials have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills , such as for the broad-spectrum antibacterial rifampicin , these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes ' causing increased breakdown of the pill 's active ingredients . Effects on the intestinal flora , which might result in reduced absorption of estrogens in the colon , have also been suggested , but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial . Clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures be applied during therapies using antibacterials that are suspected to interact with oral contraceptives .
One of the few city states who managed to maintain full independence from the control of any Hellenistic kingdom was Rhodes . With a skilled navy to protect its trade fleets from pirates and an ideal strategic position covering the routes from the east into the Aegean , Rhodes prospered during the Hellenistic period . It became a center of culture and commerce , its coins were widely circulated and its philosophical schools became one of the best in the mediterranean . After holding out for one year under siege by Demetrius Poliorcetes ( 304-305 BCE ) , the Rhodians built the Colossus of Rhodes to commemorate their victory . They retained their independence by the maintenance of a powerful navy , by maintaining a carefully neutral posture and acting to preserve the balance of power between the major Hellenistic kingdoms .
Oklahoma 's largest commercial airport is Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City , averaging a yearly passenger count of more than 3.5 million ( 1.7 million boardings ) in 2010 . Tulsa International Airport , the state 's second largest commercial airport , served more than 1.3 million boardings in 2010 . Between the two , six airlines operate in Oklahoma . In terms of traffic , R. L. Jones Jr. ( Riverside ) Airport in Tulsa is the state 's busiest airport , with 335,826 takeoffs and landings in 2008 . In total , Oklahoma has over 150 public-use airports .
With its myriad islands , Alaska has nearly 34,000 miles ( 54,720 km ) of tidal shoreline . The Aleutian Islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula . Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions . Unimak Island , for example , is home to Mount Shishaldin , which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to 10,000 feet ( 3,048 m ) above the North Pacific . It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth , even more symmetrical than Japan 's Mount Fuji . The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr , west of Anchorage on the mainland . Geologists have identified Alaska as part of Wrangellia , a large region consisting of multiple states and Canadian provinces in the Pacific Northwest , which is actively undergoing continent building .
One crucial innovation in reconceptualizing genotypic and phenotypic variation was the anthropologist C. Loring Brace 's observation that such variations , insofar as it is affected by natural selection , slow migration , or genetic drift , are distributed along geographic gradations or clines . In part this is due to isolation by distance . This point called attention to a problem common to phenotype-based descriptions of races ( for example , those based on hair texture and skin color ) : they ignore a host of other similarities and differences ( for example , blood type ) that do not correlate highly with the markers for race . Thus , anthropologist Frank Livingstone 's conclusion , that since clines cross racial boundaries , " there are no races , only clines " .
The first lighting used on an airport was during the latter part of the 1920s ; in the 1930s approach lighting came into use . These indicated the proper direction and angle of descent . The colours and flash intervals of these lights became standardized under the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) . In the 1940s , the slope-line approach system was introduced . This consisted of two rows of lights that formed a funnel indicating an aircraft 's position on the glideslope . Additional lights indicated incorrect altitude and direction .
This time they succeeded , and on 31 December 1600 , the Queen granted a Royal Charter to " George , Earl of Cumberland , and 215 Knights , Aldermen , and Burgesses " under the name , Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading with the East Indies . For a period of fifteen years the charter awarded the newly formed company a monopoly on trade with all countries east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan . Sir James Lancaster commanded the first East India Company voyage in 1601 and returned in 1603. and in March 1604 Sir Henry Middleton commanded the second voyage . General William Keeling , a captain during the second voyage , led the third voyage from 1607 to 1610 .
Compact Disc ( CD ) is a digital optical disc data storage format . The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data ( CD-ROM ) . Several other formats were further derived from these , including write-once audio and data storage ( CD-R ) , rewritable media ( CD-RW ) , Video Compact Disc ( VCD ) , Super Video Compact Disc ( SVCD ) , Photo CD , PictureCD , CD-i , and Enhanced Music CD . Audio CDs and audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982 .
Medieval writers divided history into periods such as the " Six Ages " or the " Four Empires " , and considered their time to be the last before the end of the world . When referring to their own times , they spoke of them as being " modern " . In the 1330s , the humanist and poet Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua ( or " ancient " ) and to the Christian period as nova ( or " new " ) . Leonardo Bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodisation in his History of the Florentine People ( 1442 ) . Bruni and later historians argued that Italy had recovered since Petrarch 's time , and therefore added a third period to Petrarch 's two . The " Middle Ages " first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas or " middle season " . In early usage , there were many variants , including medium aevum , or " middle age " , first recorded in 1604 , and media saecula , or " middle ages " , first recorded in 1625 . The alternative term " medieval " ( or occasionally " mediaeval " ) derives from medium aevum . Tripartite periodisation became standard after the German 17th century historian Christoph Cellarius divided history into three periods : Ancient , Medieval , and Modern .
The name Shell is linked to The " Shell " Transport and Trading Company . In 1833 , the founder 's father , Marcus Samuel , founded an import business to sell seashells to London collectors . When collecting seashell specimens in the Caspian Sea area in 1892 , the younger Samuel realised there was potential in exporting lamp oil from the region and commissioned the world 's first purpose-built oil tanker , the Murex ( Latin for a type of snail shell ) , to enter this market ; by 1907 the company had a fleet . Although for several decades the company had a refinery at Shell Haven on the Thames , there is no evidence of this having provided the name .
Before World War II , Guam and three other territories – American Samoa , Hawaii , and the Philippines – were the only American jurisdictions in the Pacific Ocean . On December 7 , 1941 , hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor , Guam was captured by the Japanese , and was occupied for thirty months . During the occupation , Guamanians were subjected to culture alignment , forced labor , beheadings , rape , and torture . Guam endured hostilities when American forces recaptured the island on July 21 , 1944 ; Liberation Day commemorates the victory . Since the 1960s , the economy is supported by two industries : tourism and the United States Armed Forces .
The Clerk of the Parliaments , an official of the House of Lords , traditionally states a formula in Anglo-Norman Law French , indicating the sovereign 's decision . The granting of royal assent to a supply bill is indicated with the words " La Reyne remercie ses bons sujets , accepte leur benevolence , et ainsi le veult " , translated as " The Queen thanks her good subjects , accepts their bounty , and wills it so . " For other public or private bills , the formula is simply " La Reyne le veult " ( " the Queen wills it " ) . For personal bills , the phrase is " Soit fait comme il est désiré " ( " let it be as it is desired " ) . The appropriate formula for withholding assent is the euphemistic " La Reyne s'avisera " ( " the Queen will consider it " ) . When the sovereign is male , Le Roy is substituted for La Reyne .
Changes in secondary sex characteristics include every change that is not directly related to sexual reproduction . In males , these changes involve appearance of pubic , facial , and body hair , deepening of the voice , roughening of the skin around the upper arms and thighs , and increased development of the sweat glands . In females , secondary sex changes involve elevation of the breasts , widening of the hips , development of pubic and underarm hair , widening of the areolae , and elevation of the nipples . The changes in secondary sex characteristics that take place during puberty are often referred to in terms of five Tanner stages , named after the British pediatrician who devised the categorization system .
Israel has embraced solar energy ; its engineers are on the cutting edge of solar energy technology and its solar companies work on projects around the world . Over 90 % of Israeli homes use solar energy for hot water , the highest per capita in the world . According to government figures , the country saves 8 % of its electricity consumption per year because of its solar energy use in heating . The high annual incident solar irradiance at its geographic latitude creates ideal conditions for what is an internationally renowned solar research and development industry in the Negev Desert . Israel had a modern electric car infrastructure involving a countrywide network of recharging stations to facilitate the charging and exchange of car batteries . It was thought that this would have lowered Israel 's oil dependency and lowered the fuel costs of hundreds of Israel 's motorists that use cars powered only by electric batteries . The Israeli model was being studied by several countries and being implemented in Denmark and Australia . However , Israel 's trailblazing electric car company Better Place shut down in 2013 .
In contrast to Catholic allegations of rationalism and naturalism , Protestant objections are more likely to be based on allegations of mysticism , occultism , and even Satanism . Masonic scholar Albert Pike is often quoted ( in some cases misquoted ) by Protestant anti-Masons as an authority for the position of Masonry on these issues . However , Pike , although undoubtedly learned , was not a spokesman for Freemasonry and was also controversial among Freemasons in general . His writings represented his personal opinion only , and furthermore an opinion grounded in the attitudes and understandings of late 19th century Southern Freemasonry of the USA . Notably , his book carries in the preface a form of disclaimer from his own Grand Lodge . No one voice has ever spoken for the whole of Freemasonry .
Japanese land forces continued to advance in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea . From July 1942 , a few Australian reserve battalions , many of them very young and untrained , fought a stubborn rearguard action in New Guinea , against a Japanese advance along the Kokoda Track , towards Port Moresby , over the rugged Owen Stanley Ranges . The militia , worn out and severely depleted by casualties , were relieved in late August by regular troops from the Second Australian Imperial Force , returning from action in the Mediterranean theater . In early September 1942 Japanese marines attacked a strategic Royal Australian Air Force base at Milne Bay , near the eastern tip of New Guinea . They were beaten back by Allied ( primarily Australian Army ) forces .
U.S. President Barack Obama has rarely used the term , but in his inaugural address on 20 January 2009 , he stated " Our nation is at war , against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred . " In March 2009 the Defense Department officially changed the name of operations from " Global War on Terror " to " Overseas Contingency Operation " ( OCO ) . In March 2009 , the Obama administration requested that Pentagon staff members avoid use of the term , instead using " Overseas Contingency Operation " . Basic objectives of the Bush administration " war on terror " , such as targeting al Qaeda and building international counterterrorism alliances , remain in place . In December 2012 , Jeh Johnson , the General Counsel of the Department of Defense , stated that the military fight will be replaced by a law enforcement operation when speaking at Oxford University , predicting that al Qaeda will be so weakened to be ineffective , and has been " effectively destroyed " , and thus the conflict will not be an armed conflict under international law . In May 2013 , Obama stated that the goal is " to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America " ; which coincided with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget having changed the wording from " Overseas Contingency Operations " to " Countering Violent Extremism " in 2010 .
On 22 July 2010 , the British government agreed to help pay for the new airport using taxpayer money . In November 2011 a new deal between the British government and South African civil engineering company Basil Read was signed and the airport was scheduled to open in February 2016 , with flights to and from South Africa and the UK . In March 2015 South African airline Comair became the preferred bidder to provide weekly air service between the island and Johannesburg , starting from 2016 .
To begin with , England had no permanent home stadium . They joined FIFA in 1906 and played their first ever games against countries other than the Home Nations on a tour of Central Europe in 1908 . Wembley Stadium was opened in 1923 and became their home ground . The relationship between England and FIFA became strained , and this resulted in their departure from FIFA in 1928 , before they rejoined in 1946 . As a result , they did not compete in a World Cup until 1950 , in which they were beaten in a 1–0 defeat by the United States , failing to get past the first round in one of the most embarrassing defeats in the team 's history .
Lancashire had a lively culture of choral and classical music , with very large numbers of local church choirs from the 17th century , leading to the foundation of local choral societies from the mid-18th century , often particularly focused on performances of the music of Handel and his contemporaries . It also played a major part in the development of brass bands which emerged in the county , particularly in the textile and coalfield areas , in the 19th century . The first open competition for brass bands was held at Manchester in 1853 , and continued annually until the 1980s . The vibrant brass band culture of the area made an important contribution to the foundation and staffing of the Hallé Orchestra from 1857 , the oldest extant professional orchestra in the United Kingdom . The same local musical tradition produced eminent figures such as Sir William Walton ( 1902–88 ) , son of an Oldham choirmaster and music teacher , Sir Thomas Beecham ( 1879–1961 ) , born in St. Helens , who began his career by conducting local orchestras and Alan Rawsthorne ( 1905–71 ) born in Haslingden . The conductor David Atherton , co-founder of the London Sinfonietta , was born in Blackpool in 1944 . Lancashire also produced more populist figures , such as early musical theatre composer Leslie Stuart ( 1863–1928 ) , born in Southport , who began his musical career as organist of Salford Cathedral .
Arnold , Constable was the first American department store . It was founded in 1825 by Aaron Arnold ( 1794 ? -1876 ) , an emigrant from Great Britain , as a small dry goods store on Pine Street in New York City . In 1857 the store moved into a five-story white marble dry goods palace known as the Marble House . During the Civil War Arnold , Constable was one of the first stores to issue charge bills of credit to its customers each month instead of on a bi-annual basis . Recognized as an emporium for high-quality fashions , the store soon outgrew the Marble House and erected a cast-iron building on Broadway and Nineteenth Street in 1869 ; this “Palace of Trade” expanded over the years until it was necessary to move into a larger space in 1914 . In 1925 , Arnold , Constable merged with Stewart & Company and expanded into the suburbs , first with a 1937 store in New Rochelle , New York and later in Hempstead and Manhasset on Long Island , and in New Jersey . Financial problems led to bankruptcy in 1975 .
Adolescence is also a time for rapid cognitive development . Piaget describes adolescence as the stage of life in which the individual 's thoughts start taking more of an abstract form and the egocentric thoughts decrease . This allows the individual to think and reason in a wider perspective . A combination of behavioural and fMRI studies have demonstrated development of executive functions , that is , cognitive skills that enable the control and coordination of thoughts and behaviour , which are generally associated with the prefrontal cortex . The thoughts , ideas and concepts developed at this period of life greatly influence one 's future life , playing a major role in character and personality formation .
Major League Baseball is especially well known for red teams . The Cincinnati Red Stockings are the oldest professional baseball team , dating back to 1869 . The franchise soon relocated to Boston and is now the Atlanta Braves , but its name survives as the origin for both the Cincinnati Reds and Boston Red Sox . During the 1950s when red was strongly associated with communism , the modern Cincinnati team was known as the " Redlegs " and the term was used on baseball cards . After the red scare faded , the team was known as the " Reds " again . The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are also known for their color red , as are the St. Louis Cardinals , Arizona Diamondbacks , and the Philadelphia Phillies .
On 29 May 1842 , Victoria was riding in a carriage along The Mall , London , when John Francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire ; he escaped . The following day , Victoria drove the same route , though faster and with a greater escort , in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act . As expected , Francis shot at her , but he was seized by plain-clothes policemen , and convicted of high treason . On 3 July , two days after Francis 's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life , John William Bean also tried to fire a pistol at the Queen , but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge . Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840 . Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail . In a similar attack in 1849 , unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria 's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill , London . In 1850 , the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer , Robert Pate . As Victoria was riding in a carriage , Pate struck her with his cane , crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead . Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years ' transportation .
Portuguese is the official language of Portugal . Portuguese is a Romance language that originated in what is now Galicia and Northern Portugal , originating from Galician-Portuguese , which was the common language of the Galician and Portuguese people until the independence of Portugal . Particularly in the North of Portugal , there are still many similarities between the Galician culture and the Portuguese culture . Galicia is a consultative observer of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries . According to the Ethnologue of Languages , Portuguese and Spanish have a lexical similarity of 89 % - educated speakers of each language can communicate easily with one another .
Notably , a statute does not disappear automatically merely because it has been found unconstitutional ; it must be deleted by a subsequent statute . Many federal and state statutes have remained on the books for decades after they were ruled to be unconstitutional . However , under the principle of stare decisis , no sensible lower court will enforce an unconstitutional statute , and any court that does so will be reversed by the Supreme Court . Conversely , any court that refuses to enforce a constitutional statute ( where such constitutionality has been expressly established in prior cases ) will risk reversal by the Supreme Court .
The 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies . Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan . Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the US ( SERI , now NREL ) , Japan ( NEDO ) , and Germany ( Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE ) .
Within a population , it is common for different ages and/or sexes to have different patterns of timing and distance . Female chaffinches Fringilla coelebs in Eastern Fennoscandia migrate earlier in the autumn than males do .
German air supremacy at night was also now under threat . British night-fighter operations out over the Channel were proving highly successful . This was not immediately apparent . The Bristol Blenheim F.1 was undergunned , with just four .303 in ( 7.7 mm ) machine guns which struggled to down the Do 17 , Ju 88 , or Heinkel He 111 . Moreover , the Blenheim struggled to reach the speed of the German bombers . Added to the fact an interception relied on visual sighting , a kill was most elusive even in the conditions of a moonlit sky .
Indigenous peoples of Brazil make up 0.4 % of Brazil 's population , or about 700,000 people , even though millions of Brazilians have some indigenous ancestry . Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil , although the majority of them live in Indian reservations in the North and Center-Western part of the country . On January 18 , 2007 , FUNAI reported that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in Brazil , up from 40 in 2005 . With this addition Brazil has now overtaken the island of New Guinea as the country having the largest number of uncontacted tribes .
Pope Paul VI knew the Roman Curia well , having worked there for a generation from 1922 to 1954 . He implemented his reforms in stages , rather than in one fell swoop . On 1 March 1968 , he issued a regulation , a process that had been initiated by Pius XII and continued by John XXIII . On 28 March , with Pontificalis Domus , and in several additional Apostolic Constitutions in the following years , he revamped the entire Curia , which included reduction of bureaucracy , streamlining of existing congregations and a broader representation of non-Italians in the curial positions .
Anthropologists such as C. Loring Brace , the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther , and the geneticist Joseph Graves , [ page needed ] have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as " continental races " , this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations . The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled . When one samples continental groups , the clusters become continental ; if one had chosen other sampling patterns , the clustering would be different . Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders , Mayans and Maoris , three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori , Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials . Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that , seen in this way , both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments . They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies , this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species , because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions . Moreover , the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions ( i.e. , splitters ) or a continuum ( i.e. , lumpers ) . Under Kaplan and Winther 's view , racial groupings are objective social constructions ( see Mills 1998 ) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons . In earlier work , Winther had identified " diversity partitioning " and " clustering analysis " as two separate methodologies , with distinct questions , assumptions , and protocols . Each is also associated with opposing ontological consequences vis-a-vis the metaphysics of race .
Patent infringement typically is caused by using or selling a patented invention without permission from the patent holder . The scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection is defined in the claims of the granted patent . There is safe harbor in many jurisdictions to use a patented invention for research . This safe harbor does not exist in the US unless the research is done for purely philosophical purposes , or in order to gather data in order to prepare an application for regulatory approval of a drug . In general , patent infringement cases are handled under civil law ( e.g. , in the United States ) but several jurisdictions incorporate infringement in criminal law also ( for example , Argentina , China , France , Japan , Russia , South Korea ) .
Buddhism is practiced by an estimated 488 million , [ web 1 ] 495 million , or 535 million people as of the 2010s , representing 7 % to 8 % of the world 's total population .
An upscale lifestyle publication called Slice Magazine is circulated throughout the metropolitan area . In addition , there is a magazine published by Back40 Design Group called The Edmond Outlook . It contains local commentary and human interest pieces direct-mailed to over 50,000 Edmond residents .
While medieval pageants and festivals such as Corpus Christi were church-sanctioned , Carnival was also a manifestation of medieval folk culture . Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals , such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian–Alemannic Fastnacht . However , evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals . No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive and the shared features of feasting , role reversals , temporary social equality , masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals . These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions . For example , Easter begins with the resurrection of Jesus , followed by a liminal period and ends with rebirth . Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life , a liminal period follows before his death . Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar . Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures who make a gift to the people with their deaths . In the case of Jesus , the gift is eternal life in heaven and in the case of King Carnival , the acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life . Besides Christian anti-Judaism , the commonalities between church and Carnival rituals and imagery suggest a common root . Christ 's passion is itself grotesque : Since early Christianity Christ is figured as the victim of summary judgement , is tortured and executed by Romans before a Jewish mob ( " His blood is on us and on our children ! " Matthew 27:24–25 ) . Holy Week processions in Spain include crowds who vociferously insult the figure of Jesus . Irreverence , parody , degradation and laughter at a tragicomic effigy God can be seen as intensifications of the sacred order . In 1466 , the Catholic Church under Pope Paul II revieved customs of the Saturnalia carnival : Jews were forced to race naked through the streets of the city of Rome . “Before they were to run , the Jews were richly fed , so as to make the race more difficult for them and at the same time more amusing for spectators . They ran… amid Rome’s taunting shrieks and peals of laughter , while the Holy Father stood upon a richly ornamented balcony and laughed heartily” , an eyewitness reports .

The Daily Star had been launched in 1978 by Express Newspaper , and by 1981 had begun to affect sales of The Sun . Bingo was introduced as a marketing tool and a 2p drop in cover price removed the Daily Star 's competitive advantage opening a new circulation battle which resulted in The Sun neutralising the threat of the new paper . The new editor of The Sun , Kelvin MacKenzie , took up his post in 1981 just after these developments , and " changed the British tabloid concept more profoundly than [ Larry ] Lamb did " , according to Bruce Page , MacKenzie The paper became " more outrageous , opinionated and irreverent than anything ever produced in Britain " .
A " country pub " by tradition is a rural public house . However , the distinctive culture surrounding country pubs , that of functioning as a social centre for a village and rural community , has been changing over the last thirty or so years . In the past , many rural pubs provided opportunities for country folk to meet and exchange ( often local ) news , while others—especially those away from village centres—existed for the general purpose , before the advent of motor transport , of serving travellers as coaching inns .
The city is also in the process of implementing a 5-year and 20 year Bike Action Plan with a goal of attaining 14 to 35 % bicycle transportation mode share by 2030 through the installation of enhanced bicycle infrastructure throughout the city . Other environmentally focused initiatives include curbside recycling , curbside composting bins ( in addition to trash , yard-waste , and recycle bins ) , farmers ' markets , community gardens , garden-share , an urban forest initiative , a hazardous materials home-collection service , green business certification , and a municipal bus system which is currently being revamped to integrate with the soon-to-open Expo Line .
Rebetiko , initially a music associated with the lower classes , later ( and especially after the population exchange between Greece and Turkey ) reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished , sometimes to the point of unrecognizability . It was the base of the later laïkó ( song of the people ) . The leading performers of the genre include Apostolos Kaldaras , Grigoris Bithikotsis , Stelios Kazantzidis , George Dalaras , Haris Alexiou and Glykeria .
Her fourth studio album 4 was released on June 28 , 2011 in the US . 4 sold 310,000 copies in its first week and debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart , giving Beyoncé her fourth consecutive number-one album in the US . The album was preceded by two of its singles " Run the World ( Girls ) " and " Best Thing I Never Had " , which both attained moderate success . The fourth single " Love on Top " was a commercial success in the US . 4 also produced four other singles ; " Party " , " Countdown " , " I Care " and " End of Time " . " Eat , Play , Love " , a cover story written by Beyoncé for Essence that detailed her 2010 career break , won her a writing award from the New York Association of Black Journalists . In late 2011 , she took the stage at New York 's Roseland Ballroom for four nights of special performances : the 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé concerts saw the performance of her 4 album to a standing room only .
Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration ( jhāna , Sanskrit ध्यान dhyāna ) , his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight ( vipassanā ) into the ultimate nature of reality , eventually obtaining release from all suffering . The cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration , which is needed to achieve insight .
Heat is energy in transit that flows due to temperature difference . Unlike heat transmitted by thermal conduction or thermal convection , thermal radiation can propagate through a vacuum . Thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that is associated with emission from an object , due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature . Thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength , and at very high temperatures such radiations are associated with spectra far above the infrared , extending into visible , ultraviolet , and even X-ray regions ( i.e. , the solar corona ) . Thus , the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical ( comparatively low ) temperatures often found near the surface of planet Earth .
Popular representations of John first began to emerge during the Tudor period , mirroring the revisionist histories of the time . The anonymous play The Troublesome Reign of King John portrayed the king as a " proto-Protestant martyr " , similar to that shown in John Bale 's morality play Kynge Johan , in which John attempts to save England from the " evil agents of the Roman Church " . By contrast , Shakespeare 's King John , a relatively anti-Catholic play that draws on The Troublesome Reign for its source material , offers a more " balanced , dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto-Protestant victim of Rome 's machinations and as a weak , selfishly motivated ruler " . Anthony Munday 's play The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington portrays many of John 's negative traits , but adopts a positive interpretation of the king 's stand against the Roman Catholic Church , in line with the contemporary views of the Tudor monarchs . By the middle of the 17th century , plays such as Robert Davenport 's King John and Matilda , although based largely on the earlier Elizabethan works , were transferring the role of Protestant champion to the barons and focusing more on the tyrannical aspects of John 's behaviour .
Gamal Abdel Nasser was born on 15 January 1918 in Bakos , Alexandria , the first son of Fahima and Abdel Nasser Hussein . Nasser 's father was a postal worker born in Beni Mur in Upper Egypt and raised in Alexandria , and his mother 's family came from Mallawi , el-Minya . His parents married in 1917 , and later had two more boys , Izz al-Arab and al-Leithi . Nasser 's biographers Robert Stephens and Said Aburish wrote that Nasser 's family believed strongly in the " Arab notion of glory " , since the name of Nasser 's brother , Izz al-Arab , translates to " Glory of the Arabs " —a rare name in Egypt .
The mascot of Northwestern Athletics is Willie the Wildcat . The first mascot , however , was a live , caged bear cub from the Lincoln Park Zoo named Furpaw who was brought to the playing field on the day of a game to greet the fans . But after a losing season , the team , deciding that Furpaw was to blame for its misfortune , banished him from campus forever . Willie the Wildcat made his debut in 1933 first as a logo , and then in three dimensions in 1947 , when members of the Alpha Delta fraternity dressed as wildcats during a Homecoming Parade . The Northwestern University Marching Band ( NUMB ) performs at all home football games and leads cheers in the student section and performs the Alma Mater at the end of the game .
In 1994 , over a hundred intrusions were made by unidentified crackers into the Rome Laboratory , the US Air Force 's main command and research facility . Using trojan horses , hackers were able to obtain unrestricted access to Rome 's networking systems and remove traces of their activities . The intruders were able to obtain classified files , such as air tasking order systems data and furthermore able to penetrate connected networks of National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Wright-Patterson Air Force Base , some Defense contractors , and other private sector organizations , by posing as a trusted Rome center user .
In Western culture , the study of politics is first found in Ancient Greece . The antecedents of European politics trace their roots back even earlier than Plato and Aristotle , particularly in the works of Homer , Hesiod , Thucydides , Xenophon , and Euripides . Later , Plato analyzed political systems , abstracted their analysis from more literary- and history- oriented studies and applied an approach we would understand as closer to philosophy . Similarly , Aristotle built upon Plato 's analysis to include historical empirical evidence in his analysis .
Victoria married her first cousin , Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha , in 1840 . Their nine children married into royal and noble families across the continent , tying them together and earning her the sobriquet " the grandmother of Europe " . After Albert 's death in 1861 , Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances . As a result of her seclusion , republicanism temporarily gained strength , but in the latter half of her reign her popularity recovered . Her Golden and Diamond Jubilees were times of public celebration .
Israel is a leading country in the development of solar energy . Israel is a global leader in water conservation and geothermal energy , and its development of cutting-edge technologies in software , communications and the life sciences have evoked comparisons with Silicon Valley . According to the OECD , Israel is also ranked 1st in the world in expenditure on Research and Development ( R & D ) as a percentage of GDP . Intel and Microsoft built their first overseas research and development centers in Israel , and other high-tech multi-national corporations , such as IBM , Google , Apple , HP , Cisco Systems , and Motorola , have opened R & D facilities in the country .
In the United States , non-Caucasian LGBT individuals may find themselves in a double minority , where they are neither fully accepted or understood by mainly Caucasian LGBT communities , nor are they accepted by their own ethnic group . Many people experience racism in the dominant LGBT community where racial stereotypes merge with gender stereotypes , such that Asian-American LGBTs are viewed as more passive and feminine , while African-American LGBTs are viewed as more masculine and aggressive . There are a number of culturally specific support networks for LGBT individuals active in the United States . For example , " Ô-Môi " for Vietnamese American queer females .
Victoria visited mainland Europe regularly for holidays . In 1889 , during a stay in Biarritz , she became the first reigning monarch from Britain to set foot in Spain when she crossed the border for a brief visit . By April 1900 , the Boer War was so unpopular in mainland Europe that her annual trip to France seemed inadvisable . Instead , the Queen went to Ireland for the first time since 1861 , in part to acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war . In July , her second son Alfred ( " Affie " ) died ; " Oh , God ! My poor darling Affie gone too " , she wrote in her journal . " It is a horrible year , nothing but sadness & horrors of one kind & another . "
For African Americans , the one-drop rule was a significant factor in ethnic solidarity . African Americans generally shared a common cause in society regardless of their multiracial admixture , or social/economic stratification . Additionally , African Americans found it , near , impossible to learn about their Indigenous American heritage as many family elders withheld pertinent genealogical information . Tracing the genealogy of African Americans can be a very difficult process , especially for descendants of Indigenous Americans , because African Americans who were slaves were forbidden to learn to read and write , and a majority of Indigenous Americans neither spoke English , nor read or wrote it .
Although the LaserDisc format was supplanted by DVD by the late 1990s , many LD titles are still highly coveted by movie enthusiasts ( for example , Disney 's Song of the South which is unavailable in the US in any format , but was issued in Japan on LD ) . This is largely because there are many films that are still only available on LD and many other LD releases contain supplemental material not available on subsequent DVD versions of those films . Until the end of 2001 , many titles were released on VHS , LD , and DVD in Japan .
The Charaka Samhita , thought to have been written between 300 and 500 AD , mentions a metal which , when oxidized , produces pushpanjan , thought to be zinc oxide . Zinc mines at Zawar , near Udaipur in India , have been active since the Mauryan period . The smelting of metallic zinc here , however , appears to have begun around the 12th century AD . One estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries . Another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period . The Rasaratna Samuccaya , written in approximately the 13th century AD , mentions two types of zinc-containing ores : one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes .
This is held to be the first explanation of the modern concept of totalitarian state . Burke regarded the war with France as ideological , against an " armed doctrine " . He wished that France would not be partitioned due to the effect this would have on the balance of power in Europe , and that the war was not against France , but against the revolutionaries governing her . Burke said : " It is not France extending a foreign empire over other nations : it is a sect aiming at universal empire , and beginning with the conquest of France " .
The first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder , also known as Adalard of Corbie , though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century . Before the thirteenth century , and until the sixteenth century , during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring , beer was flavoured with other plants ; for instance , grains of paradise or alehoof . Combinations of various aromatic herbs , berries , and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used . Some beers today , such as Fraoch ' by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company , use plants other than hops for flavouring .
Of the third Dalai Lama , China Daily states that the " Ming dynasty showed him special favor by allowing him to pay tribute . " China Daily then says that Sonam Gyatso was granted the title Dorjichang or Vajradhara Dalai Lama in 1587 [ sic ! ] , but China Daily does not mention who granted him the title . Without mentioning the role of the Mongols , China Daily states that it was the successive Qing dynasty which established the title of Dalai Lama and his power in Tibet : " In 1653 , the Qing emperor granted an honorific title to the fifth Dalai Lama and then did the same for the fifth Panchen Lama in 1713 , officially establishing the titles of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni , and their political and religious status in Tibet . "
Carnival in Haiti started in 1804 in the capital Port-au-Prince after the declaration of independence . The Port-au-Prince Carnival is one of the largest in North America . It is known as Kanaval in the Creole language . It starts in January , known as " Pre-Kanaval " , while the main carnival activities begin in February . In July 2012 , Haiti had another carnival called Kanaval de Fleur . Beautiful costumes , floats , Rara parades , masks , foods , and popular rasin music ( like Boukman Eksperyans , Foula Vodoule , Tokay , Boukan Ginen , Eritaj , etc . ) and kompa bands ( such as T-Vice , Djakout No . 1 , Sweet Micky , Kreyòl La , D.P . Express , Mizik Mizik , Ram , T-Micky , Carimi , Djakout Mizik , and Scorpio Fever ) play for dancers in the streets of the plaza of Champ-de-Mars . An annual song competition takes place .
In most US and Canadian jurisdictions , passenger elevators are required to conform to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers ' Standard A17.1 , Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators . As of 2006 , all states except Kansas , Mississippi , North Dakota , and South Dakota have adopted some version of ASME codes , though not necessarily the most recent . In Canada the document is the CAN/CSA B44 Safety Standard , which was harmonized with the US version in the 2000 edition . [ citation needed ] In addition , passenger elevators may be required to conform to the requirements of A17.3 for existing elevators where referenced by the local jurisdiction . Passenger elevators are tested using the ASME A17.2 Standard . The frequency of these tests is mandated by the local jurisdiction , which may be a town , city , state or provincial standard .
Social insects , such as termites , ants and many bees and wasps , are the most familiar species of eusocial animal . They live together in large well-organized colonies that may be so tightly integrated and genetically similar that the colonies of some species are sometimes considered superorganisms . It is sometimes argued that the various species of honey bee are the only invertebrates ( and indeed one of the few non-human groups ) to have evolved a system of abstract symbolic communication where a behavior is used to represent and convey specific information about something in the environment . In this communication system , called dance language , the angle at which a bee dances represents a direction relative to the sun , and the length of the dance represents the distance to be flown . :309–311 Though perhaps not as advanced as honey bees , bumblebees also potentially have some social communication behaviors . Bombus terrestris , for example , exhibit a faster learning curve for visiting unfamiliar , yet rewarding flowers , when they can see a conspecific foraging on the same species .
The territory that now constitutes Tajikistan was previously home to several ancient cultures , including the city of Sarazm of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age , and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures , including the Oxus civilization , Andronovo culture , Buddhism , Nestorian Christianity , Zoroastrianism , and Manichaeism . The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties , including the Achaemenid Empire , Sassanian Empire , Hephthalite Empire , Samanid Empire , Mongol Empire , Timurid dynasty , and the Russian Empire . As a result of the breakup of the Soviet Union , Tajikistan became an independent nation in 1991 . A civil war was fought almost immediately after independence , lasting from 1992 to 1997 . Since the end of the war , newly established political stability and foreign aid have allowed the country 's economy to grow .
She has received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded with Destiny 's Child and her solo efforts . Her early songs were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like " Independent Women " and " Survivor " , but after the start of her relationship with Jay Z she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as " Cater 2 U " . Beyoncé has also received co-producing credits for most of the records in which she has been involved , especially during her solo efforts . However , she does not formulate beats herself , but typically comes up with melodies and ideas during production , sharing them with producers .
Pope Paul VI became the first reigning pontiff ever to visit the Americas when he flew to New York in October 1965 to address the United Nations . As a gesture of goodwill , the pope gave to the UN two pieces of papal jewelry , a diamond cross and ring , with the hopes that the proceeds from their sale at auction would contribute to the UN 's efforts to end human suffering . During the pope 's visit , as the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War escalated under President Johnson , Paul VI pleaded for peace before the UN :
With too low a bit rate , compression artifacts ( i.e. , sounds that were not present in the original recording ) may be audible in the reproduction . Some audio is hard to compress because of its randomness and sharp attacks . When this type of audio is compressed , artifacts such as ringing or pre-echo are usually heard . A sample of applause compressed with a relatively low bit rate provides a good example of compression artifacts .
Phytochemistry is a branch of plant biochemistry primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism . Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock . Others , such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma , as flavourings and spices ( e.g. , capsaicin ) , and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies . Many medicinal and recreational drugs , such as tetrahydrocannabinol ( active ingredient in cannabis ) , caffeine , morphine and nicotine come directly from plants . Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products . For example , the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid , originally isolated from the bark of willow trees , and a wide range of opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy . Popular stimulants come from plants , such as caffeine from coffee , tea and chocolate , and nicotine from tobacco . Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley ( beer ) , rice ( sake ) and grapes ( wine ) .
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had a mother who was a dark-skinned Nubian Sudanese woman and a father who was a lighter-skinned Egyptian . In response to an advertisement for an acting position , as a young man he said , " I am not white but I am not exactly black either . My blackness is tending to reddish " .
Season eight premiered on January 13 , 2009 . Mike Darnell , the president of alternative programming for Fox , stated that the season would focus more on the contestants ' personal life . Much early attention on the show was therefore focused on the widowhood of Danny Gokey . [ citation needed ]
Season 11 premiered on January 18 , 2012 . On February 23 , it was announced that one more finalist would join the Top 24 making it the Top 25 , and that was Jermaine Jones . However , on March 14 , Jones was disqualified in 12th place for concealing arrests and outstanding warrants . Jones denied the accusation that he concealed his arrests .
Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related . Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area . Conversion to " trivial " standardized ecosystems ( e.g. , monoculture following deforestation ) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion . In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss ( degradation costs having to be supported by the community ) . [ citation needed ]
Cork is home to one of Ireland 's main national newspapers , the Irish Examiner ( formerly the Cork Examiner ) . It also prints the Evening Echo , which for decades has been connected to the Echo Boys , who were poor and often homeless children who sold the newspaper . Today , the shouts of the vendors selling the Echo can still be heard in various parts of the city centre . One of the biggest free newspapers in the city is the Cork Independent . The city 's University publishes the UCC Express and Motley magazine .
What industries children work in depends on if they grew up in a rural area or an urban area . Children who were born in urban areas often found themselves working for street vendors , washing cars , helping in construction sites , weaving clothing , and sometimes even working as exotic dancers . While children who grew up in rural areas would work on farms doing physical labour , working with animals , and selling crops . Of all the child workers , the most serious cases involved street children and trafficked children due to the physical and emotional abuse they endured by their employers . To address the issue of child labour , the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child Act was implemented in 1959 . Yet due to poverty , lack of education and ignorance , the legal actions were not/are not wholly enforced or accepted in Africa .
Although the 1945–1949 expulsion of Germans from the northern part of former East Prussia was often conducted in a violent and aggressive way by Soviet officials , the present Russian inhabitants of the Kaliningrad Oblast have much less animosity towards Germans . German names have been revived in commercial Russian trade and there is sometimes talk of reverting Kaliningrad 's name to its historic name of Königsberg . The city centre of Kaliningrad was completely rebuilt , as British bombs in 1944 and the Soviet siege in 1945 had left it in nothing but ruins .
The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica ( areas situated south of the Antarctic Convergence ) were British and American sealers who used to spend a year or more on South Georgia , from 1786 onward . During the whaling era , which lasted until 1966 , the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer ( over 2,000 in some years ) to some 200 in the winter . Most of the whalers were Norwegian , with an increasing proportion of Britons . The settlements included Grytviken , Leith Harbour , King Edward Point , Stromness , Husvik , Prince Olav Harbour , Ocean Harbour and Godthul . Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families . Among them was the founder of Grytviken , Captain Carl Anton Larsen , a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who , along with his family , adopted British citizenship in 1910 .
Meanwhile , the Chinese Ming dynasty fell to the rebellion of Li Zicheng ( 1606–1645 ) in 1644 , yet his short-lived Shun dynasty was crushed by the Manchu invasion and the Han Chinese general Wu Sangui ( 1612–1678 ) . China Daily states that when the following Qing dynasty replaced the Ming dynasty , it merely " strengthened administration of Tibet . " However , Kolmaš states that the Dalai Lama was very observant of what was going on in China and accepted a Manchu invitation in 1640 to send envoys to their capital at Mukden in 1642 , before the Ming collapsed . Dawa Norbu , William Rockhill , and George N. Patterson write that when the Shunzhi Emperor ( r. 1644–1661 ) of the subsequent Qing dynasty invited the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso to Beijing in 1652 , Shunzhi treated the Dalai Lama as an independent sovereign of Tibet . Patterson writes that this was an effort of Shunzhi to secure an alliance with Tibet that would ultimately lead to the establishment of Manchu rule over Mongolia . In this meeting with the Qing emperor , Goldstein asserts that the Dalai Lama was not someone to be trifled with due to his alliance with Mongol tribes , some of which were declared enemies of the Qing . Van Praag states that Tibet and the Dalai Lama 's power was recognized by the " Manchu Emperor , the Mongolian Khans and Princes , and the rulers of Ladakh , Nepal , India , Bhutan , and Sikkim . "
While worship in the Temple in Jerusalem included musical instruments ( 2 Chronicles 29:25–27 ) , traditional Jewish religious services in the Synagogue , both before and after the last destruction of the Temple , did not include musical instruments given the practice of scriptural cantillation . The use of musical instruments is traditionally forbidden on the Sabbath out of concern that players would be tempted to repair ( or tune ) their instruments , which is forbidden on those days . ( This prohibition has been relaxed in many Reform and some Conservative congregations . ) Similarly , when Jewish families and larger groups sing traditional Sabbath songs known as zemirot outside the context of formal religious services , they usually do so a cappella , and Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations on the Sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles . During the Three Weeks musical instruments are prohibited . Many Jews consider a portion of the 49-day period of the counting of the omer between Passover and Shavuot to be a time of semi-mourning and instrumental music is not allowed during that time . This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as sefirah music .
LE : Life expectancy at birth MYS : Mean years of schooling ( Years that a person 25 years-of-age or older has spent in schools ) EYS : Expected years of schooling ( Years that a 5-year-old child will spend in schools throughout his life ) GNIpc : Gross national income at purchasing power parity per capita
Hydrogen is the only element that has different names for its isotopes in common use today . During the early study of radioactivity , various heavy radioactive isotopes were given their own names , but such names are no longer used , except for deuterium and tritium . The symbols D and T ( instead of 2H and 3H ) are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium , but the corresponding symbol for protium , P , is already in use for phosphorus and thus is not available for protium . In its nomenclatural guidelines , the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry allows any of D , T , 2H , and 3H to be used , although 2H and 3H are preferred .
Architecture ( Latin architectura , from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων arkhitekton " architect " , from ἀρχι- " chief " and τέκτων " builder " ) is both the process and the product of planning , designing , and constructing buildings and other physical structures . Architectural works , in the material form of buildings , are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art . Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements .
Meanwhile , U.S. garrisons in Japan continually dispatched soldiers and matériel to reinforce defenders in the Pusan Perimeter . Tank battalions deployed to Korea directly from the U.S. mainland from the port of San Francisco to the port of Pusan , the largest Korean port . By late August , the Pusan Perimeter had some 500 medium tanks battle-ready . In early September 1950 , ROK Army and UN Command forces outnumbered the KPA 180,000 to 100,000 soldiers . The UN forces , once prepared , counterattacked and broke out of the Pusan Perimeter .
West is among the most critically acclaimed artists of the twenty-first century , receiving praise from music critics , fans , fellow musicians , artists , and wider cultural figures for his work . AllMusic editor Jason Birchmeier writes of his impact , " As his career progressed throughout the early 21st century , West shattered certain stereotypes about rappers , becoming a superstar on his own terms without adapting his appearance , his rhetoric , or his music to fit any one musical mold . " Jon Caramanic of The New York Times said that West has been " a frequent lightning rod for controversy , a bombastic figure who can count rankling two presidents among his achievements , along with being a reliably dyspeptic presence at award shows ( when he attends them ) . " Village Voice Media senior editor Ben Westhoff dubbed him the greatest hip hop artist of all time , writing that " he 's made the best albums and changed the game the most , and his music is the most likely to endure , " while Complex called him the 21st century 's " most important artist of any art form , of any genre . " The Guardian has compared West to David Bowie , arguing that " there is nobody else who can sell as many records as West does ( 30m-odd album sales and counting ) while remaining so resolutely experimental and capable of stirring things up culturally and politically . "
Despite occasional theoretical diversity , the actual practice of translation has hardly changed since antiquity . Except for some extreme metaphrasers in the early Christian period and the Middle Ages , and adapters in various periods ( especially pre-Classical Rome , and the 18th century ) , translators have generally shown prudent flexibility in seeking equivalents — " literal " where possible , paraphrastic where necessary — for the original meaning and other crucial " values " ( e.g. , style , verse form , concordance with musical accompaniment or , in films , with speech articulatory movements ) as determined from context .
Comandante general Simón Elías González , was nominated governor and military command was given to Colonel J.J. Calvo , whose firmness had earned well-merited praise . The state was in the midst of a war with the Apaches , which became the focus of all their energy and resources . After a review of the situation , Simón Elías González declared that the interests of the territory would be best served by uniting the civil and military power , at least while the campaign lasted . He resigned under opposition , but was renominated in 1837 .
Pesticides safety education and pesticide applicator regulation are designed to protect the public from pesticide misuse , but do not eliminate all misuse . Reducing the use of pesticides and choosing less toxic pesticides may reduce risks placed on society and the environment from pesticide use . Integrated pest management , the use of multiple approaches to control pests , is becoming widespread and has been used with success in countries such as Indonesia , China , Bangladesh , the U.S. , Australia , and Mexico . IPM attempts to recognize the more widespread impacts of an action on an ecosystem , so that natural balances are not upset . New pesticides are being developed , including biological and botanical derivatives and alternatives that are thought to reduce health and environmental risks . In addition , applicators are being encouraged to consider alternative controls and adopt methods that reduce the use of chemical pesticides .
Chopin 's life and his relations with George Sand have been fictionalized in numerous films . The 1945 biographical film A Song to Remember earned Cornel Wilde an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor for his portrayal of the composer . Other film treatments have included : La valse de l'adieu ( France , 1928 ) by Henry Roussel , with Pierre Blanchar as Chopin ; Impromptu ( 1991 ) , starring Hugh Grant as Chopin ; La note bleue ( 1991 ) ; and Chopin : Desire for Love ( 2002 ) .
The annelids are bilaterally symmetrical , triploblastic , coelomate , invertebrate organisms . They also have parapodia for locomotion . Most textbooks still use the traditional division into polychaetes ( almost all marine ) , oligochaetes ( which include earthworms ) and leech-like species . Cladistic research since 1997 has radically changed this scheme , viewing leeches as a sub-group of oligochaetes and oligochaetes as a sub-group of polychaetes . In addition , the Pogonophora , Echiura and Sipuncula , previously regarded as separate phyla , are now regarded as sub-groups of polychaetes . Annelids are considered members of the Lophotrochozoa , a " super-phylum " of protostomes that also includes molluscs , brachiopods , flatworms and nemerteans .
Like most other regions of central and southern Germany , Thuringia has a significant industrial sector reaching back to the mid-19th-century industrialisation . The economic transition after the German reunification in 1990 led to the closure of most large-scale factories and companies , leaving small and medium-sized ones to dominate the manufacturing sector . Well-known industrial centres are Jena ( a world centre for optical instruments with companies like Carl Zeiss , Schott and Jenoptik ) and Eisenach , where BMW started its car production in the 1920s and an Opel factory is based today . The most important industrial branches today are engineering and metalworking , vehicle production and food industries . Especially the small and mid-sized towns in central and southwestern Thuringia ( e.g . Arnstadt , Schmalkalden and Ohrdruf ) are highly industrialised , whereas there are fewer industrial companies in the northern and eastern parts of the Land . Traditional industries like production of glass , porcelain and toys collapsed during the economic crises between 1930 and 1990 .
Aspiration has varying significance in different languages . It is either allophonic or phonemic , and may be analyzed as an underlying consonant cluster .
Dell traces its origins to 1984 , when Michael Dell created Dell Computer Corporation , which at the time did business as PC 's Limited , while a student of the University of Texas at Austin . The dorm-room headquartered company sold IBM PC-compatible computers built from stock components . Dell dropped out of school to focus full-time on his fledgling business , after getting $ 1,000 in expansion-capital from his family . In 1985 , the company produced the first computer of its own design , the Turbo PC , which sold for $ 795 . PC 's Limited advertised its systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers and custom assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options . The company grossed more than $ 73 million in its first year of operation .
Archaeologists excavating near the city have unearthed Iron Age sites that may date from 500 BCE . The region comprising modern Hyderabad and its surroundings was known as Golkonda ( Golla Konda- " shepherd 's hill " ) , and was ruled by the Chalukya dynasty from 624 CE to 1075 CE . Following the dissolution of the Chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century , Golkonda came under the control of the Kakatiya dynasty from 1158 , whose seat of power was at Warangal , 148 km ( 92 mi ) northeast of modern Hyderabad .
On 7 August 1998 , al-Qaeda struck the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , killing 224 people , including 12 Americans . In retaliation , U.S. President Bill Clinton launched Operation Infinite Reach , a bombing campaign in Sudan and Afghanistan against targets the U.S. asserted were associated with WIFJAJC , although others have questioned whether a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan was used as a chemical warfare plant . The plant produced much of the region 's antimalarial drugs and around 50 % of Sudan 's pharmaceutical needs . The strikes failed to kill any leaders of WIFJAJC or the Taliban .
In single phase squirrel cage motors , the primary winding within the motor housing is not capable of starting a rotational motion on the rotor , but is capable of sustaining one . To start the motor , a secondary " start " winding has a series non-polarized starting capacitor to introduce a lead in the sinusoidal current . When the secondary ( start ) winding is placed at an angle with respect to the primary ( run ) winding , a rotating electric field is created . The force of the rotational field is not constant , but is sufficient to start the rotor spinning . When the rotor comes close to operating speed , a centrifugal switch ( or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding ) disconnects the capacitor . The start capacitor is typically mounted to the side of the motor housing . These are called capacitor-start motors , that have relatively high starting torque . Typically they can have up-to four times as much starting torque than a split-phase motor and are used on applications such as compressors , pressure washers and any small device requiring high starting torques .
In contemporary society , adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform . While some of these , such as emotional distress ( fear of abuse or exploitation ) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases ( STIs/STDs ) , including HIV/AIDS , are not necessarily inherent to adolescence , others such as teenage pregnancy ( through non-use or failure of contraceptives ) are seen as social problems in most western societies . One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI . Adolescents in the United States often chose " anything but intercourse " for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs . Across the country , clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , which can cause genital warts , and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population . Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group . One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21 . Multrine also states in her article that according to a March survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation , eighty-one percent of parents want schools to discuss the use of condoms and contraception with their children . They also believe students should be able to be tested for STIs . Furthermore , teachers want to address such topics with their students . But , although 9 in 10 sex education instructors across the country believe that students should be taught about contraceptives in school , over one quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators not to do so . According to anthropologist Margaret Mead , the turmoil found in adolescence in Western society has a cultural rather than a physical cause ; they reported that societies where young women engaged in free sexual activity had no such adolescent turmoil .
The 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index ( IHDI ) . While the simple HDI remains useful , it stated that " the IHDI is the actual level of human development ( accounting for inequality ) , " and " the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential ' human development ( or the maximum IHDI that could be achieved if there were no inequality ) . "
In 2013 , Houston was identified as the # 1 U.S. city for job creation by the U.S. Bureau of Statistics after it was not only the first major city to regain all the jobs lost in the preceding economic downturn , but after the crash , more than two jobs were added for every one lost . Economist and vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership Patrick Jankowski attributed Houston 's success to the ability of the region 's real estate and energy industries to learn from historical mistakes . Furthermore , Jankowski stated that " more than 100 foreign-owned companies relocated , expanded or started new businesses in Houston " between 2008 and 2010 , and this openness to external business boosted job creation during a period when domestic demand was problematically low . Also in 2013 , Houston again appeared on Forbes ' list of Best Places for Business and Careers .
The first electric elevator was built by Werner von Siemens in 1880 in Germany . The inventor Anton Freissler developed the ideas of von Siemens and built up a successful enterprise in Austria-Hungary . The safety and speed of electric elevators were significantly enhanced by Frank Sprague who added floor control , automatic elevators , acceleration control of cars , and safeties . His elevator ran faster and with larger loads than hydraulic or steam elevators , and 584 electric elevators were installed before Sprague sold his company to the Otis Elevator Company in 1895 . Sprague also developed the idea and technology for multiple elevators in a single shaft .
Following a series of arcade game successes in the early 1980s , Nintendo made plans to create a cartridge-based console called the Famicom . Masayuki Uemura designed the system . Original plans called for an advanced 16-bit system which would function as a full-fledged computer with a keyboard and floppy disk drive , but Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi rejected this and instead decided to go for a cheaper , more conventional cartridge-based game console as he felt that features such as keyboards and disks were intimidating to non-technophiles . A test model was constructed in October 1982 to verify the functionality of the hardware , after which work began on programming tools . Because 65xx CPUs had not been manufactured or sold in Japan up to that time , no cross-development software was available and it had to be produced from scratch . Early Famicom games were written on a system that ran on an NEC PC-8001 computer and LEDs on a grid were used with a digitizer to design graphics as no software design tools for this purpose existed at that time .

In 2004 , the two institutions created the Architecture Gallery ( Room 128 ) at the V & A showing artefacts from the collections of both institutions , this was the first permanent gallery devoted to architecture in the UK . The adjacent Architecture Exhibition Space ( Room 128a ) is used for temporary displays related to architecture . Both spaces were designed by Gareth Hoskins Architects . At the same time the RIBA Library Drawing and Archives Collections moved from 21 Portman Place to new facilities in the Henry Cole Wing at the V & A . Under the Partnership new study rooms were opened where members of the public could view items from the RIBA and V & A architectural collections under the supervision of curatorial staff . These and the nearby education room were designed by Wright & Wright Architects .
The reaction to the encyclical 's continued prohibitions of artificial birth control was very mixed . In Italy , Spain , Portugal and Poland , the encyclical was welcomed . In Latin America , much support developed for the Pope and his encyclical . As World Bank President Robert McNamara declared at the 1968 Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group that countries permitting birth control practices would get preferential access to resources , doctors in La Paz , Bolivia called it insulting that money should be exchanged for the conscience of a Catholic nation . In Colombia , Cardinal archbishop Aníbal Muñoz Duque declared , if American conditionality undermines Papal teachings , we prefer not to receive one cent . The Senate of Bolivia passed a resolution stating that Humanae vitae could be discussed in its implications for individual consciences , but was of greatest significance because the papal document defended the rights of developing nations to determine their own population policies . The Jesuit Journal Sic dedicated one edition to the encyclical with supportive contributions .
The distinctive characteristic of French cathedrals , and those in Germany and Belgium that were strongly influenced by them , is their height and their impression of verticality . Each French cathedral tends to be stylistically unified in appearance when compared with an English cathedral where there is great diversity in almost every building . They are compact , with slight or no projection of the transepts and subsidiary chapels . The west fronts are highly consistent , having three portals surmounted by a rose window , and two large towers . Sometimes there are additional towers on the transept ends . The east end is polygonal with ambulatory and sometimes a chevette of radiating chapels . In the south of France , many of the major churches are without transepts and some are without aisles .
In contrast to the speed of compression , which is proportional to the number of operations required by the algorithm , here latency refers to the number of samples that must be analysed before a block of audio is processed . In the minimum case , latency is zero samples ( e.g. , if the coder/decoder simply reduces the number of bits used to quantize the signal ) . Time domain algorithms such as LPC also often have low latencies , hence their popularity in speech coding for telephony . In algorithms such as MP3 , however , a large number of samples have to be analyzed to implement a psychoacoustic model in the frequency domain , and latency is on the order of 23 ms ( 46 ms for two-way communication ) ) .
Unpopulated boards are usually bare-board tested for " shorts " and " opens " . A short is a connection between two points that should not be connected . An open is a missing connection between points that should be connected . For high-volume production a fixture or a rigid needle adapter is used to make contact with copper lands on the board . Building the adapter is a significant fixed cost and is only economical for high-volume or high-value production . For small or medium volume production flying probe testers are used where test probes are moved over the board by an XY drive to make contact with the copper lands . The CAM system instructs the electrical tester to apply a voltage to each contact point as required and to check that this voltage appears on the appropriate contact points and only on these .
Popular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of Mary 's conception . In 1439 , the Council of Basel , which is not reckoned an ecumenical council , stated that belief in the immaculate conception of Mary is in accord with the Catholic faith . By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties , but such was the influence of the Dominicans , and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas ( who had been canonised in 1323 and declared " Doctor Angelicus " of the Church in 1567 ) that the Council of Trent ( 1545–63 ) —which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine—instead declined to take a position .
In May 1970 , the Revolutionary Intellectuals Seminar was held to bring intellectuals in line with the revolution , while that year 's Legislative Review and Amendment united secular and religious law codes , introducing sharia into the legal system . Ruling by decree , the RCC maintained the monarchy 's ban on political parties , in May 1970 banned trade unions , and in 1972 outlawed workers ' strikes and suspended newspapers . In September 1971 , Gaddafi resigned , claiming to be dissatisfied with the pace of reform , but returned to his position within a month . In February 1973 , he resigned again , once more returning the following month .
Russell 's ministry , though Whig , was not favoured by the Queen . She found particularly offensive the Foreign Secretary , Lord Palmerston , who often acted without consulting the Cabinet , the Prime Minister , or the Queen . Victoria complained to Russell that Palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without her knowledge , but Palmerston was retained in office and continued to act on his own initiative , despite her repeated remonstrances . It was only in 1851 that Palmerston was removed after he announced the British government 's approval of President Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte 's coup in France without consulting the Prime Minister . The following year , President Bonaparte was declared Emperor Napoleon III , by which time Russell 's administration had been replaced by a short-lived minority government led by Lord Derby .
The coup completed , the RCC proceeded with their intentions of consolidating the revolutionary government and modernizing the country . They purged monarchists and members of Idris ' Senussi clan from Libya 's political world and armed forces ; Gaddafi believed this elite were opposed to the will of the Libyan people and had to be expunged . " People 's Courts " were founded to try various monarchist politicians and journalists , and though many were imprisoned , none were executed . Idris was sentenced to execution in absentia .
Melbourne is an international cultural centre , with cultural endeavours spanning major events and festivals , drama , musicals , comedy , music , art , architecture , literature , film and television . The climate , waterfront location and nightlife make it one of the most vibrant destinations in Australia . For five years in a row ( as of 2015 ) it has held the top position in a survey by The Economist Intelligence Unit of the world 's most liveable cities on the basis of a number of attributes which include its broad cultural offerings . The city celebrates a wide variety of annual cultural events and festivals of all types , including Australia 's largest free community festival—Moomba , the Melbourne International Arts Festival , Melbourne International Film Festival , Melbourne International Comedy Festival and the Melbourne Fringe Festival . The culture of the city is an important drawcard for tourists , of which just under two million international overnight visitors and 57.7 million domestic overnight visited during the year ending March 2014 .
By 1763 , the war in Central Europe was essentially a stalemate . Frederick had retaken most of Silesia and Saxony but not the latter 's capital , Dresden . His financial situation was not dire , but his kingdom was devastated and his army severely weakened . His manpower had dramatically decreased , and he had lost so many effective officers and generals that a new offensive was perhaps impossible . British subsidies had been stopped by the new Prime Minister Lord Bute , and the Russian Emperor had been overthrown by his wife , Catherine , who ended Russia 's alliance with Prussia and withdrew from the war . Austria , however , like most participants , was facing a severe financial crisis and had to decrease the size of its army , something which greatly affected its offensive power . Indeed , after having effectively sustained a long war , its administration was in disarray . By that time , it still held Dresden , the southeastern parts of Saxony , the county of Glatz , and southern Silesia , but the prospect of victory was dim without Russian support . In 1763 a peace settlement was reached at the Treaty of Hubertusburg , ending the war in central Europe .
The former ten-year moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants was the result of a citizens ' initiative voted on in 1990 which had passed with 54.5 % Yes vs. 45.5 % No votes . Plans for a new nuclear plant in the Canton of Bern have been put on hold after the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 2011 . The Swiss Federal Office of Energy ( SFOE ) is the office responsible for all questions relating to energy supply and energy use within the Federal Department of Environment , Transport , Energy and Communications ( DETEC ) . The agency is supporting the 2000-watt society initiative to cut the nation 's energy use by more than half by the year 2050 .
Possibly as early as the second century AD , Virgil 's works were seen as having magical properties and were used for divination . In what became known as the Sortes Vergilianae ( Virgilian Lots ) , passages would be selected at random and interpreted to answer questions . In the 12th century , starting around Naples but eventually spreading widely throughout Europe , a tradition developed in which Virgil was regarded as a great magician . Legends about Virgil and his magical powers remained popular for over two hundred years , arguably becoming as prominent as his writings themselves . Virgil 's legacy in medieval Wales was such that the Welsh version of his name , Fferyllt or Pheryllt , became a generic term for magic-worker , and survives in the modern Welsh word for pharmacist , fferyllydd .
The country bounced between socialism and adherence to the neoliberal model . Land reform and nationalizations were enforced ; the Portuguese Constitution ( approved in 1976 ) was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principles . Until the constitutional revisions of 1982 and 1989 , the constitution was a highly charged ideological document with numerous references to socialism , the rights of workers , and the desirability of a socialist economy . Portugal 's economic situation after its transition to democracy , obliged the government to pursue International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) -monitored stabilization programs in 1977–78 and 1983–85 .
Theories of coregulation describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process , rather than a discrete exchange of information . Canadian media scholar Harold Innis had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society ( Wark , McKenzie 1997 ) . His famous example of this is using ancient Egypt and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus . Papyrus is what he called 'Space Binding ' . it made possible the transmission of written orders across space , empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration . The other is stone and 'Time Binding ' , through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation , through this media they can change and shape communication in their society ( Wark , McKenzie 1997 ) .
The community was established by several shiploads of settlers from Bermuda ( which lies due east of South Carolina , although at 1,030 km or 640 mi , it is closest to Cape Hatteras , North Carolina ) , under the leadership of governor William Sayle , on the west bank of the Ashley River , a few miles northwest of the present-day city center . It was soon predicted by the Earl of Shaftesbury , one of the Lords Proprietors , to become a " great port towne " , a destiny the city quickly fulfilled . In 1680 , the settlement was moved east of the Ashley River to the peninsula between the Ashley and Cooper Rivers . Not only was this location more defensible , but it also offered access to a fine natural harbor .
The indigenous peoples of the Americas are the descendants of the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Americas . Pueblos indígenas ( indigenous peoples ) is a common term in Spanish-speaking countries . Aborigen ( aboriginal/native ) is used in Argentina , whereas " Amerindian " is used in Quebec , The Guianas , and the English-speaking Caribbean . Indigenous peoples are commonly known in Canada as Aboriginal peoples , which include First Nations , Inuit , and Métis peoples . Indigenous peoples of the United States are commonly known as Native Americans or American Indians , and Alaska Natives .
In some cases a wrestler may possess admirable physical traits but perceived mediocre public speaking abilities ( such as Brock Lesnar ) , or their gimmick may be that of a " wild savage " needing a handler ( such as Kamala ) . Such performers have historically employed a manager , who speaks on their behalf and adds to the performance . Managers have sometimes become major personalities , including Bobby Heenan , Paul Heyman , Ernie Roth , and Paul Bearer . A manager role may also be filled by a " valet " , typically an appealing female who may participate in love triangle storylines , " damsel in distress " situations , and scripted fights with female wrestlers . Some of these have also gone on to become recognized stars , such as Tammy Lynn Sytch , Stacy Keibler , and Miss Elizabeth .
Polish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as Moritz Moszkowski , but , in the opinion of J. Barrie Jones , his " one worthy successor " among his compatriots was Karol Szymanowski ( 1882–1937 ) . Edvard Grieg , Antonín Dvořák , Isaac Albéniz , Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Sergei Rachmaninoff , among others , are regarded by critics as having been influenced by Chopin 's use of national modes and idioms . Alexander Scriabin was devoted to the music of Chopin , and his early published works include nineteen mazurkas , as well as numerous études and preludes ; his teacher Nikolai Zverev drilled him in Chopin 's works to improve his virtuosity as a performer . In the 20th century , composers who paid homage to ( or in some cases parodied ) the music of Chopin included George Crumb , Bohuslav Martinů , Darius Milhaud , Igor Stravinsky and Heitor Villa-Lobos .
Labour improved its performance in 1987 , gaining 20 seats and so reducing the Conservative majority from 143 to 102 . They were now firmly re-established as the second political party in Britain as the Alliance had once again failed to make a breakthrough with seats . A merger of the SDP and Liberals formed the Liberal Democrats . Following the 1987 election , the National Executive Committee resumed disciplinary action against members of Militant , who remained in the party , leading to further expulsions of their activists and the two MPs who supported the group .
The earliest recorded history of the region dates back to about 500 BCE when much , if not all , of modern Tajikistan was part of the Achaemenid Empire . Some authors have also suggested that in the 7th and 6th century BCE parts of modern Tajikistan , including territories in the Zeravshan valley , formed part of Kambojas before it became part of the Achaemenid Empire . After the region 's conquest by Alexander the Great it became part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom , a successor state of Alexander 's empire . Northern Tajikistan ( the cities of Khujand and Panjakent ) was part of Sogdia , a collection of city-states which was overrun by Scythians and Yuezhi nomadic tribes around 150 BCE . The Silk Road passed through the region and following the expedition of Chinese explorer Zhang Qian during the reign of Wudi ( 141–87 BCE ) commercial relations between Han China and Sogdiana flourished . Sogdians played a major role in facilitating trade and also worked in other capacities , as farmers , carpetweavers , glassmakers , and woodcarvers .
3 kV DC is used in Belgium , Italy , Spain , Poland , the northern Czech Republic , Slovakia , Slovenia , South Africa , Chile , and former Soviet Union countries ( also using 25 kV 50 Hz AC ) . It was formerly used by the Milwaukee Road from Harlowton , Montana to Seattle-Tacoma , across the Continental Divide and including extensive branch and loop lines in Montana , and by the Delaware , Lackawanna & Western Railroad ( now New Jersey Transit , converted to 25 kV AC ) in the United States , and the Kolkata suburban railway ( Bardhaman Main Line ) in India , before it was converted to 25 kV 50 Hz AC .
In 1983 , the Antarctic Treaty Parties began negotiations on a convention to regulate mining in Antarctica . A coalition of international organizations launched a public pressure campaign to prevent any minerals development in the region , led largely by Greenpeace International , which established its own scientific station—World Park Base—in the Ross Sea region and conducted annual expeditions to document environmental effects of humans on Antarctica . In 1988 , the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources ( CRAMRA ) was adopted . The following year , however , Australia and France announced that they would not ratify the convention , rendering it dead for all intents and purposes . They proposed instead that a comprehensive regime to protect the Antarctic environment be negotiated in its place . The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty ( the " Madrid Protocol " ) was negotiated as other countries followed suit and on 14 January 1998 it entered into force . The Madrid Protocol bans all mining in Antarctica , designating Antarctica a " natural reserve devoted to peace and science " .
The consensus of modern scholarship is that the New Testament accounts represent a crucifixion occurring on a Friday , but a Thursday or Wednesday crucifixion have also been proposed . Some scholars explain a Thursday crucifixion based on a " double sabbath " caused by an extra Passover sabbath falling on Thursday dusk to Friday afternoon , ahead of the normal weekly Sabbath . Some have argued that Jesus was crucified on Wednesday , not Friday , on the grounds of the mention of " three days and three nights " in Matthew before his resurrection , celebrated on Sunday . Others have countered by saying that this ignores the Jewish idiom by which a " day and night " may refer to any part of a 24-hour period , that the expression in Matthew is idiomatic , not a statement that Jesus was 72 hours in the tomb , and that the many references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights .
In 1897 , Victoria had written instructions for her funeral , which was to be military as befitting a soldier 's daughter and the head of the army , and white instead of black . On 25 January , Edward VII , the Kaiser and Prince Arthur , Duke of Connaught , helped lift her body into the coffin . She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil . An array of mementos commemorating her extended family , friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her , at her request , by her doctor and dressers . One of Albert 's dressing gowns was placed by her side , with a plaster cast of his hand , while a lock of John Brown 's hair , along with a picture of him , was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers . Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown 's mother , given to her by Brown in 1883 . Her funeral was held on Saturday , 2 February , in St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle , and after two days of lying-in-state , she was interred beside Prince Albert in Frogmore Mausoleum at Windsor Great Park . As she was laid to rest at the mausoleum , it began to snow .
On February 6 , 2016 , one day before her performance at the Super Bowl , Beyoncé released a new single exclusively on music streaming service Tidal called " Formation " .
Despite repeated efforts by the Tajik government to improve and expand health care , the system remains extremely underdeveloped and poor , with severe shortages of medical supplies . The state 's Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare reported that 104,272 disabled people are registered in Tajikistan ( 2000 ) . This group of people suffers most from poverty in Tajikistan . The government of Tajikistan and the World Bank considered activities to support this part of the population described in the World Bank 's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper . Public expenditure on health was at 1 % of the GDP in 2004 .
Federal law and treaties , so long as they are in accordance with the Constitution , preempt conflicting state and territorial laws in the 50 U.S. states and in the territories . However , the scope of federal preemption is limited because the scope of federal power is not universal . In the dual-sovereign system of American federalism ( actually tripartite because of the presence of Indian reservations ) , states are the plenary sovereigns , each with their own constitution , while the federal sovereign possesses only the limited supreme authority enumerated in the Constitution . Indeed , states may grant their citizens broader rights than the federal Constitution as long as they do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights . Thus , most U.S. law ( especially the actual " living law " of contract , tort , property , criminal , and family law experienced by the majority of citizens on a day-to-day basis ) consists primarily of state law , which can and does vary greatly from one state to the next .
Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success , such as Aerosmith , with their number one multi-platinum albums : Get a Grip ( 1993 ) , which produced four Top 40 singles and became the band 's best-selling album worldwide ( going on to sell over 10 million copies ) , and Nine Lives ( 1997 ) . In 1998 , Aerosmith released the number one hit " I Do n't Want to Miss a Thing " , which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one . AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker ( 1995 ) . Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as " Keep the Faith " ( 1992 ) , but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio , with the Top 10 ballads " Bed of Roses " ( 1993 ) and " Always " ( 1994 ) . Bon Jovi 's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States , spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart . Metallica 's Load ( 1996 ) and ReLoad ( 1997 ) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound . As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade , post-grunge bands emerged . They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge , particularly thick , distorted guitars , but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock . Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters , Candlebox , Live , Collective Soul , Australia 's Silverchair and England 's Bush , who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s . Similarly , some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis , including Feeder and Stereophonics , adopted a hard rock or " pop-metal " sound .
In Dutch , the diminutive is not merely restricted to nouns and exist in numerals ( met z'n tweetjes , " the two of us " ) , pronouns ( onderonsje , " tête-à-tête " ) , verbal particles ( moetje , " shotgun marriage " ) , and even prepositions ( toetje , " dessert " ) . Most notable however , are the diminutive forms of adjectives and adverbs . The former take an diminutive ending and thus functions as a noun , the latter remain adverbs and have always the diminutive with the -s appended , e.g . adjective : groen ( " green " ) → noun : groentje ( " rookie " ) ; adverb : even ( " just " ) → adverb : eventjes ( " just a minute " ) .
For over 200 years , Russia had been expanding southwards across the sparsely populated " Wild Fields " toward the warm water ports of the Black Sea that did not freeze over like the handful of other ports available in the north . The goal was to promote year-round trade and a year-round navy . :11 Pursuit of this goal brought the emerging Russian state into conflict with the Ukrainian Cossacks and then with the Tatars of the Crimean Khanate and Circassians . When Russia conquered these groups and gained possession of southern Ukraine , known as New Russia during Russian imperial times , the Ottoman Empire lost its buffer zone against Russian expansion , and Russia and the Ottoman Empire fell into direct conflict . The conflict with the Ottoman Empire also presented a religious issue of importance , as Russia saw itself as the protector of Orthodox Christians , many of whom lived under Ottoman control and were treated as second-class citizens .

In the 2007–2008 school year , there were 181,973 undergraduate students , 20,014 graduate students , and 4,395 first-professional degree students enrolled in Oklahoma colleges . Of these students , 18,892 received a bachelor 's degree , 5,386 received a master 's degree , and 462 received a first professional degree . This means the state of Oklahoma produces an average of 38,278 degree-holders per completions component ( i.e . July 1 , 2007 – June 30 , 2008 ) . National average is 68,322 total degrees awarded per completions component .
Public expenditure health was at 8.9 % of the GDP in 2004 , whereas private expenditure was at 1.3 % . As of 2012 , the HIV/AIDS prevalence was at 2.8 % among 15- to 49-year-olds . Health expenditure was at US $ 30 per capita in 2004 . A large proportion of the population is undernourished , with malnutrition being a problem in Congo-Brazzaville . There were 20 physicians per 100,000 persons in the early 2000s ( decade ) .
In 1941 , Zuse followed his earlier machine up with the Z3 , the world 's first working electromechanical programmable , fully automatic digital computer . The Z3 was built with 2000 relays , implementing a 22 bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about 5–10 Hz . Program code was supplied on punched film while data could be stored in 64 words of memory or supplied from the keyboard . It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects , pioneering numerous advances such as floating point numbers . Replacement of the hard-to-implement decimal system ( used in Charles Babbage 's earlier design ) by the simpler binary system meant that Zuse 's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable , given the technologies available at that time . The Z3 was Turing complete .
During the 19th century , an important producer of art was the Academia de San Carlos ( San Carlos Art Academy ) , founded during colonial times , and which later became the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas ( the National School of Arts ) including painting , sculpture and graphic design , one of UNAM 's art schools . Many of the works produced by the students and faculty of that time are now displayed in the Museo Nacional de San Carlos ( National Museum of San Carlos ) . One of the students , José María Velasco , is considered one of the greatest Mexican landscape painters of the 19th century . Porfirio Díaz 's regime sponsored arts , especially those that followed the French school . Popular arts in the form of cartoons and illustrations flourished , e.g . those of José Guadalupe Posada and Manuel Manilla . The permanent collection of the San Carlos Museum also includes paintings by European masters such as Rembrandt , Velázquez , Murillo , and Rubens .
Like the reptiles , birds are primarily uricotelic , that is , their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine . Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and ( with exception of the ostrich ) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste . However , birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic , excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia . They also excrete creatine , rather than creatinine like mammals . This material , as well as the output of the intestines , emerges from the bird 's cloaca . The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening : waste is expelled through it , most birds mate by joining cloaca , and females lay eggs from it . In addition , many species of birds regurgitate pellets . Males within Palaeognathae ( with the exception of the kiwis ) , the Anseriformes ( with the exception of screamers ) , and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes ( but fully developed in Cracidae ) possess a penis , which is never present in Neoaves . The length is thought to be related to sperm competition . When not copulating , it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca , just inside the vent . The digestive system of birds is unique , with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth . Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight . Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies , including protein from the intestines , as additional energy during migration .
Institutes in Hyderabad include the National Institute of Rural Development , the Indian School of Business , the Institute of Public Enterprise , the Administrative Staff College of India and the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy . Technical and engineering schools include the International Institute of Information Technology , Hyderabad ( IIITH ) , Birla Institute of Technology and Science , Pilani – Hyderabad ( BITS Hyderabad ) and Indian Institute of Technology , Hyderabad ( IIT-H ) as well as agricultural engineering institutes such as the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics ( ICRISAT ) and the Acharya N. G. Ranga Agricultural University . Hyderabad also has schools of fashion design including Raffles Millennium International , NIFT Hyderabad and Wigan and Leigh College . The National Institute of Design , Hyderabad ( NID-H ) , will offer undergraduate and postgraduate courses from 2015 .
Maintaining continuity with his predecessors , John XXIII continued the gradual reform of the Roman liturgy , and published changes that resulted in the 1962 Roman Missal , the last typical edition containing the Tridentine Mass established in 1570 by Pope Pius V at the request of the Council of Trent and whose continued use Pope Benedict XVI authorized in 2007 , under the conditions indicated in his motu proprio Summorum Pontificum . In response to the directives of the Second Vatican Council , later editions of the Roman Missal present the 1970 form of the Roman Rite .
A study published in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants , who wanted to drink more as a result . The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans , while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer , water and a sports drink onto their tongues . Compared with the taste of the sports drink , the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink . Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release , even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated .
In 2002 , IBM acquired PwC consulting . In 2003 it initiated a project to redefine company values . Using its Jam technology , it hosted a three-day Internet-based online discussion of key business issues with 50,000 employees . Results were data mined with sophisticated text analysis software ( eClassifier ) for common themes . Three emerged , expressed as : " Dedication to every client 's success " , " Innovation that matters—for our company and for the world " , and " Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships " . Another three-day Jam took place in 2004 , with 52,000 employees discussing ways to implement company values in practice .
State banquets also take place in the Ballroom ; these formal dinners are held on the first evening of a state visit by a foreign head of state . On these occasions , for up to 170 guests in formal " white tie and decorations " , including tiaras , the dining table is laid with the Grand Service , a collection of silver-gilt plate made in 1811 for the Prince of Wales , later George IV . The largest and most formal reception at Buckingham Palace takes place every November when the Queen entertains members of the diplomatic corps . On this grand occasion , all the state rooms are in use , as the royal family proceed through them , beginning at the great north doors of the Picture Gallery . As Nash had envisaged , all the large , double-mirrored doors stand open , reflecting the numerous crystal chandeliers and sconces , creating a deliberate optical illusion of space and light .
To unambiguously specify the date , dual dating or Old Style ( O.S . ) and New Style ( N.S . ) are sometimes used with dates . Dual dating uses two consecutive years because of differences in the starting date of the year , or includes both the Julian and Gregorian dates . Old Style and New Style ( N.S . ) indicate either whether the start of the Julian year has been adjusted to start on 1 January ( N.S . ) even though documents written at the time use a different start of year ( O.S . ) , or whether a date conforms to the Julian calendar ( O.S . ) rather than the Gregorian ( N.S . ) .
Ben Goldacre has argued that regulators – such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) in the UK , or the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in the United States – advance the interests of the drug companies rather than the interests of the public due to revolving door exchange of employees between the regulator and the companies and friendships develop between regulator and company employees . He argues that regulators do not require that new drugs offer an improvement over what is already available , or even that they be particularly effective .
On 1 August , the British fleet under Horatio Nelson captured or destroyed all but two French vessels in the Battle of the Nile , defeating Bonaparte 's goal to strengthen the French position in the Mediterranean . His army had succeeded in a temporary increase of French power in Egypt , though it faced repeated uprisings . In early 1799 , he moved an army into the Ottoman province of Damascus ( Syria and Galilee ) . Bonaparte led these 13,000 French soldiers in the conquest of the coastal towns of Arish , Gaza , Jaffa , and Haifa . The attack on Jaffa was particularly brutal . Bonaparte discovered that many of the defenders were former prisoners of war , ostensibly on parole , so he ordered the garrison and 1,400 prisoners to be executed by bayonet or drowning to save bullets . Men , women , and children were robbed and murdered for three days .
Windows 8 introduces a new style of application , Windows Store apps . According to Microsoft developer Jensen Harris , these apps are to be optimized for touchscreen environments and are more specialized than current desktop applications . Apps can run either in a full-screen mode , or be snapped to the side of a screen . Apps can provide toast notifications on screen or animate their tiles on the Start screen with dynamic content . Apps can use " contracts " ; a collection of hooks to provide common functionality that can integrate with other apps , including search and sharing . Apps can also provide integration with other services ; for example , the People app can connect to a variety of different social networks and services ( such as Facebook , Skype , and People service ) , while the Photos app can aggregate photos from services such as Facebook and Flickr .
By the 1860s the Kingdom of Prussia and the Austrian Empire were the two most powerful nations dominated by German-speaking elites . Both sought to expand their influence and territory . The Austrian Empire – like the Holy Roman Empire – was a multi-ethnic state , but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority ; the creation of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the Hungarians . Prussia under Otto von Bismarck would ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany . The German Empire ( " Second Reich " ) was created in 1871 following the proclamation of Wilhelm I as head of a union of German-speaking states , while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule .
Following the Távora affair , the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition . Made " Marquis of Pombal " in 1770 , he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I 's death in 1779 . However , historians also argue that Pombal’s " enlightenment , " while far-reaching , was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition , suppressing criticism , and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit .
Over two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing , Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time . After the fall of Beijing to Li Zicheng 's rebel forces and then to the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in the spring of 1644 , the Ming prince Zhu Yousong was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor . His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called Southern Ming dynasty .
After a decade of constant warfare , France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802 , bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end . Amiens called for the withdrawal of British troops from recently conquered colonial territories as well as for assurances to curtail the expansionary goals of the French Republic . With Europe at peace and the economy recovering , Napoleon 's popularity soared to its highest levels under the Consulate , both domestically and abroad . In a new plebiscite during the spring of 1802 , the French public came out in huge numbers to approve a constitution that made the Consulate permanent , essentially elevating Napoleon to dictator for life . Whereas the plebiscite two years earlier had brought out 1.5 million people to the polls , the new referendum enticed 3.6 million to go and vote ( 72 % of all eligible voters ) . There was no secret ballot in 1802 and few people wanted to openly defy the regime ; the constitution gained approval with over 99 % of the vote . His broad powers were spelled out in the new constitution : Article 1 . The French people name , and the Senate proclaims Napoleon-Bonaparte First Consul for Life . After 1802 , he was generally referred to as Napoleon rather than Bonaparte .
From 2002 through 2008 , the Bush Administration denied funding to UNFPA that had already been allocated by the US Congress , partly on the refuted claims that the UNFPA supported Chinese government programs which include forced abortions and coercive sterilizations . In a letter from the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns to Congress , the administration said it had determined that UNFPA’s support for China’s population program “facilitates ( its ) government’s coercive abortion program” , thus violating the Kemp-Kasten Amendment , which bans the use of United States aid to finance organizations that support or take part in managing a program of coercive abortion of sterilization .
The central part of the Sahara is hyperarid , with little to no vegetation . The northern and southern reaches of the desert , along with the highlands , have areas of sparse grassland and desert shrub , with trees and taller shrubs in wadis where moisture collects . In the central , hyperarid part , there are many subdivisions of the great desert such as the Tanezrouft , the Ténéré , the Libyan Desert , the Eastern Desert , the Nubian Desert and others . These absolute desert regions are characterized by their extreme aridity , and some years can pass without any rainfall .
Nearly two billion people in the developing world are deficient in zinc . In children it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea , contributing to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year . The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea . Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality , especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth . However , zinc supplements should not be administered alone , because many in the developing world have several deficiencies , and zinc interacts with other micronutrients .
There is a sizeable Greek minority of about 105,000 ( disputed , sources claim higher ) people , in Albania . The Greek minority of Turkey , which numbered upwards of 200,000 people after the 1923 exchange , has now dwindled to a few thousand , after the 1955 Constantinople Pogrom and other state sponsored violence and discrimination . This effectively ended , though not entirely , the three-thousand-year-old presence of Hellenism in Asia Minor . There are smaller Greek minorities in the rest of the Balkan countries , the Levant and the Black Sea states , remnants of the Old Greek Diaspora ( pre-19th century ) .
In 1975 , a group of Chicago Cubs fans based in Washington , D.C. formed the Emil Verban Society . The society is a select club of high profile Cub fans , currently headed by Illinois Senator Dick Durbin which is named for Emil Verban , who in three seasons with the Cubs in the 1940s batted .280 with 39 runs batted in and one home run . Verban was picked as the epitome of a Cub player , explains columnist George Will , because " He exemplified mediocrity under pressure , he was competent but obscure and typifying of the work ethics . " Verban initially believed he was being ridiculed , but his ill feeling disappeared several years later when he was flown to Washington to meet President Ronald Reagan , also a society member , at the White House . Hillary Clinton , Jim Belushi , Joe Mantegna , Rahm Emanuel , Dick Cheney and many others have been included among its membership .
The Latin phrase on Northwestern 's seal , Quaecumque sunt vera ( Whatsoever things are true ) is drawn from the Epistle of Paul to the Philippians 4:8 , while the Greek phrase inscribed on the pages of an open book is taken from the Gospel of John 1:14 : ο λόγος πλήρης χάριτος και αληθείας ( The Word full of grace and truth ) . Purple became Northwestern 's official color in 1892 , replacing black and gold after a university committee concluded that too many other universities had used these colors . Today , Northwestern 's official color is purple , although white is something of an official color as well , being mentioned in both the university 's earliest song , Alma Mater ( 1907 ) ( " Hail to purple , hail to white " ) and in many university guidelines .
New Delhi is home to Indira Gandhi Memorial Museum , National Gallery of Modern Art , National Museum of Natural History , National Rail Museum , National Handicrafts and Handlooms Museum , National Philatelic Museum , Nehru Planetarium , Shankar 's International Dolls Museum . and Supreme Court of India Museum .
While these few hard rock bands managed to maintain success and popularity in the early part of the decade , alternative forms of hard rock achieved mainstream success in the form of grunge in the US and Britpop in the UK . This was particularly evident after the success of Nirvana 's Nevermind ( 1991 ) , which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a " dirty " sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion , fuzz and feedback , along with darker lyrical themes than their " hair band " predecessors . Although most grunge bands had a sound that sharply contrasted mainstream hard rock , several , including Pearl Jam , Alice in Chains , Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden , were more strongly influenced by 1970s and 1980s rock and metal , while Stone Temple Pilots managed to turn alternative rock into a form of stadium rock . However , all grunge bands shunned the macho , anthemic and fashion-focused aesthetics particularly associated with glam metal . In the UK , Oasis were unusual among the Britpop bands of the mid-1990s in incorporating a hard rock sound .
In the United Kingdom , a bill is presented for royal assent after it has passed all the required stages in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords . Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 , the House of Commons may , under certain circumstances , direct that a bill be presented for assent despite lack of passage by the House of Lords . Officially , assent is granted by the sovereign or by Lords Commissioners authorised to act by letters patent . It may be granted in parliament or outside parliament ; in the latter case , each house must be separately notified before the bill takes effect .
TCM regularly airs a " Star of the Month " throughout the year on Wednesdays starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time , in which most , if not all , feature films from a classic film star are shown during that night 's schedule . Hosted by Robert Osbourne , the network also marks the occurrence of a film actor 's birthday ( either antemortem or posthumously ) or recent death with day- or evening-long festivals showcasting several of that artist 's best , earliest or least-known pictures ; by effect , marathons scheduled in honor of an actor 's passing ( which are scheduled within a month after their death ) pre-empt films originally scheduled to air on that date . TCM also features a monthly program block called the " TCM Guest Programmer " , in which Osborne is joined by celebrity guests responsible for choosing that evening 's films ( examples of such programmers during 2012 include Jules Feiffer , Anthony Bourdain , Debra Winger , Ellen Barkin , Spike Lee , Regis Philbin and Jim Lehrer ) ; an offshoot of this block featuring Turner Classic Movies employees aired during February 2011 .
Leading up to the American Civil War , Baptists became embroiled in the controversy over slavery in the United States . Whereas in the First Great Awakening , Methodist and Baptist preachers had opposed slavery and urged manumission , over the decades they made more of an accommodation with the institution . They worked with slaveholders in the South to urge a paternalistic institution . Both denominations made direct appeals to slaves and free blacks for conversion . The Baptists particularly allowed them active roles in congregations . By the mid-19th century , northern Baptists tended to oppose slavery . As tensions increased , in 1844 the Home Mission Society refused to appoint a slaveholder as a missionary who had been proposed by Georgia . It noted that missionaries could not take servants with them , and also that the Board did not want to appear to condone slavery .
Poultry is available fresh or frozen , as whole birds or as joints ( cuts ) , bone-in or deboned , seasoned in various ways , raw or ready cooked . The meatiest parts of a bird are the flight muscles on its chest , called " breast " meat , and the walking muscles on the legs , called the " thigh " and " drumstick " . The wings are also eaten ( Buffalo wings are a popular example in the United States ) and may be split into three segments , the meatier " drumette " , the " wingette " ( also called the " flat " ) , and the wing tip ( also called the " flapper " ) . In Japan , the wing is frequently separated , and these parts are referred to as 手羽元 ( teba-moto " wing base " ) and 手羽先 ( teba-saki " wing tip " ) .
The Greeks of the Classical era made several notable contributions to science and helped lay the foundations of several western scientific traditions , like philosophy , historiography and mathematics . The scholarly tradition of the Greek academies was maintained during Roman times with several academic institutions in Constantinople , Antioch , Alexandria and other centres of Greek learning while Eastern Roman science was essentially a continuation of classical science . Greeks have a long tradition of valuing and investing in paideia ( education ) . Paideia was one of the highest societal values in the Greek and Hellenistic world while the first European institution described as a university was founded in 5th century Constantinople and operated in various incarnations until the city 's fall to the Ottomans in 1453 . The University of Constantinople was Christian Europe 's first secular institution of higher learning since no theological subjects were taught , and considering the original meaning of the world university as a corporation of students , the world’s first university as well .
Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related . Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area . Conversion to " trivial " standardized ecosystems ( e.g. , monoculture following deforestation ) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion . In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss ( degradation costs having to be supported by the community ) . [ citation needed ]
There are many Hokkien speakers among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia as well as in the United States . Many ethnic Han Chinese emigrants to the region were Hoklo from southern Fujian , and brought the language to what is now Burma ( Myanmar ) , Indonesia ( the former Dutch East Indies ) and present day Malaysia and Singapore ( formerly Malaya and the British Straits Settlements ) . Many of the Hokkien dialects of this region are highly similar to Taiwanese and Amoy . Hokkien is reportedly the native language of up to 98.5 % of the Chinese Filipino in the Philippines , among which is known locally as Lan-nang or Lán-lâng-oē ( " Our people’s language " ) . Hokkien speakers form the largest group of Chinese in Singapore , Malaysia and Indonesia . [ citation needed ]
In the early years of coverage the BBC had exclusive radio coverage with a picture of the pitch marked in the Radio Times with numbered squares to help the listener follow the match on the radio . The first FA Cup Final on Radio was in 1926 between Bolton Wanderers and Manchester City but this was only broadcast in Manchester , the first national final on BBC Radio was between Arsenal and Cardiff in 1927 . The first final on BBC Television was in 1937 in a match which featured Sunderland and Preston North End but this was not televised in full . The following season 's final between Preston and Huddersfield was covered in full by the BBC . When ITV was formed in 1955 they shared final coverage with the BBC in one of the only club matches shown live on television , during the 1970s and 1980s coverage became more elaborate with BBC and ITV trying to steal viewers from the others by starting coverage earlier and earlier some starting as early as 9 a.m. which was six hours before kick off . Nowadays , this continues with Setanta and ESPN having all-day broadcasts from Wembley , but terrestrial TV coverage usually begins two hours before kick off . The sharing of rights between BBC and ITV continued from 1955 to 1988 , when ITV lost coverage to the new Sports Channel which later became Sky Sports .
On 12 February 1912 , after rounds of negotiations , Longyu issued an imperial edict bringing about the abdication of the child emperor Puyi . This brought an end to over 2,000 years of Imperial China and began an extended period of instability of warlord factionalism . The unorganized political and economic systems combined with a widespread criticism of Chinese culture led to questioning and doubt about the future . In the 1930s , the Empire of Japan invaded Northeast China and founded Manchukuo in 1932 , with Puyi , as the emperor . After the invasion by the Soviet Union , Manchukuo collapsed in 1945 .
A lot of temples dedicated to Apollo were built in Greece and in the Greek colonies , and they show the spread of the cult of Apollo , and the evolution of the Greek architecture , which was mostly based on the rightness of form , and on mathematical relations . Some of the earliest temples , especially in Crete , do n't belong to any Greek order . It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangle wooden structures . The different wooden elements were considered divine , and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of Doric order . The Greeks used standard types , because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances . The temples should be canonic , and the architects were trying to achieve the esthetic perfection . From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings . The first buildings were narrow to hold the roof , and when the dimensions changed , some mathematical relations became necessary , in order to keep the original forms . This probably influenced the theory of numbers of Pythagoras , who believed that behind the appearance of things , there was the permanent principle of mathematics .
In central portions of the U.S. , tornadoes are more common than anywhere else on Earth and touch down most commonly in the spring and summer . Deadly and destructive hurricanes occur almost every year along the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico . The Appalachian region and the Midwest experience the worst floods , though virtually no area in the U.S. is immune to flooding . The Southwest has the worst droughts ; one is thought to have lasted over 500 years and to have hurt Ancestral Pueblo peoples . The West is affected by large wildfires each year .
The American Revolution begun with fighting at Lexington and Concord . On July 4 , 1776 , they issued the Declaration of Independence , which proclaimed their independence from Great Britain and their formation of a cooperative union . In June 1776 , Benjamin Franklin was appointed a member of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence . Although he was temporarily disabled by gout and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee , Franklin made several small changes to the draft sent to him by Thomas Jefferson .
Tucson is located 118 mi ( 190 km ) southeast of Phoenix and 60 mi ( 97 km ) north of the United States - Mexico border . The 2010 United States Census puts the city 's population at 520,116 with a metropolitan area population at 980,263 . In 2009 , Tucson ranked as the 32nd largest city and 52nd largest metropolitan area in the United States . A major city in the Arizona Sun Corridor , Tucson is the largest city in southern Arizona , the second largest in the state after Phoenix . It is also the largest city in the area of the Gadsden Purchase . As of 2015 , The Greater Tucson Metro area has exceeded a population of 1 million .
The iconic department stores of New Zealand 's three major centres are Smith & Caughey 's ( founded 1880 ) , in New Zealand 's most populous city , Auckland ; Kirkcaldie & Stains ( founded 1863 ) in the capital , Wellington ; and Ballantynes ( founded 1854 ) in New Zealand 's second biggest city , Christchurch . These offer high-end and luxury items . Additionally , Arthur Barnett ( 1903 ) operates in Dunedin . H & J Smith is a small chain operating throughout Southland with a large flagship store in Invercargill . Farmers is a mid-range national chain of stores ( originally a mail-order firm known as Laidlaw Leeds founded in 1909 ) . Historical department stores include DIC . Discount chains include The Warehouse , Kmart Australia , and the now-defunct DEKA .
On 1 March 1951 Mao sent a cable to Stalin , in which he emphasized the difficulties faced by Chinese forces and the urgent need for air cover , especially over supply lines . Apparently impressed by the Chinese war effort , Stalin finally agreed to supply two air force divisions , three anti-aircraft divisions , and six thousand trucks . PVA troops in Korea continued to suffer severe logistical problems throughout the war . In late April Peng Dehuai sent his deputy , Hong Xuezhi , to brief Zhou Enlai in Beijing . What Chinese soldiers feared , Hong said , was not the enemy , but that they had nothing to eat , no bullets to shoot , and no trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded . Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA 's logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving methods of supply , but these efforts were never completely sufficient . At the same time , large-scale air defense training programs were carried out , and the Chinese Air Force began to participate in the war from September 1951 onward .
After the September 2011 execution of Troy Davis , believed by many to be innocent , Richard Dieter , the director of the Death Penalty Information Center , said this case was a clear wake-up call to politicians across the United States . He said : " They were n't expecting such passion from people in opposition to the death penalty . There 's a widely held perception that all Americans are united in favor of executions , but this message came across loud and clear that many people are not happy with it . " Brian Evans of Amnesty International , which led the campaign to spare Davis 's life , said that there was a groundswell in America of people " who are tired of a justice system that is inhumane and inflexible and allows executions where there is clear doubts about guilt " . He predicted the debate would now be conducted with renewed energy .
The final son of Abd al-Malik to become caliph was Hisham ( 724–43 ) , whose long and eventful reign was above all marked by the curtailment of military expansion . Hisham established his court at Resafa in northern Syria , which was closer to the Byzantine border than Damascus , and resumed hostilities against the Byzantines , which had lapsed following the failure of the last siege of Constantinople . The new campaigns resulted in a number of successful raids into Anatolia , but also in a major defeat ( the Battle of Akroinon ) , and did not lead to any significant territorial expansion .
The term " great power " was first used to represent the most important powers in Europe during the post-Napoleonic era . The " Great Powers " constituted the " Concert of Europe " and claimed the right to joint enforcement of the postwar treaties . The formalization of the division between small powers and great powers came about with the signing of the Treaty of Chaumont in 1814 . Since then , the international balance of power has shifted numerous times , most dramatically during World War I and World War II . While some nations are widely considered to be great powers , there is no definitive list of them . In literature , alternative terms for great power are often world power or major power , but these terms can also be interchangeable with superpower .
Although the PC market declined , Apple still managed to ship 2.8 million MacBooks in Q2 2012 ( the majority of which are the MacBook Air ) compared to 500,000 total Ultrabooks , although there were dozens of Ultrabooks from various manufacturers on the market while Apple only offered 11-inch and 13-inch models of the MacBook Air . The Air has been the best-selling ultra-portable in certain countries over Windows Ultrabooks , particularly the United States . While several Ultrabooks were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest , the Air was regarded by reviewers as the best all-around subnotebook/ultraportable in regard to " OS X experience , full keyboard , superior trackpad , Thunderbolt connector and the higher-quality , all-aluminum unibody construction " . The Air was among the first to receive Intel 's latest CPUs before other PC manufacturers , and OS X has gained market share on Windows in recent years . Through July 1 , 2013 , the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States , although being one of the higher-priced competitors , though several Ultrabooks with better features were often more expensive than the MacBook Air . The competitive pricing of MacBooks was particularly effective when rivals charged more for seemingly equivalent Ultrabooks , as this contradicted the established " elitist aura " perception that Apple products cost more but were higher quality , which made these most expensive Ultrabooks seem exorbitant no matter how valid their higher prices were .
Currently , international agreements are executed by executive agreement rather than treaties at a rate of 10:1 . Despite the relative ease of executive agreements , the President still often chooses to pursue the formal treaty process over an executive agreement in order to gain congressional support on matters that require the Congress to pass implementing legislation or appropriate funds , and those agreements that impose long-term , complex legal obligations on the United States . For example , the deal by the United States , Iran and other countries is not a Treaty .
Smyth , convinced that his self-baptism was invalid , applied with the Mennonites for membership . He died while waiting for membership , and some of his followers became Mennonites . Thomas Helwys and others kept their baptism and their Baptist commitments . The modern Baptist denomination is an outgrowth of Smyth 's movement . Baptists rejected the name Anabaptist when they were called that by opponents in derision . McBeth writes that as late as the 18th century , many Baptists referred to themselves as " the Christians commonly—though falsely—called Anabaptists . "
After the war , Operation Glory was conducted from July to November 1954 , to allow combatant countries to exchange their dead . The remains of 4,167 U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps dead were exchanged for 13,528 KPA and PVA dead , and 546 civilians dead in UN prisoner-of-war camps were delivered to the South Korean government . After Operation Glory , 416 Korean War unknown soldiers were buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific ( The Punchbowl ) , on the island of Oahu , Hawaii . Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office ( DPMO ) records indicate that the PRC and the DPRK transmitted 1,394 names , of which 858 were correct . From 4,167 containers of returned remains , forensic examination identified 4,219 individuals . Of these , 2,944 were identified as American , and all but 416 were identified by name . From 1996 to 2006 , the DPRK recovered 220 remains near the Sino-Korean border .
At present , Malaysia have developed 32 polytechnic at all over states in engineering , agriculture , commerce , hospitality and design courses with 60,840 students in 2009 to 87,440 students in 2012 .
From all the fault gases formed in power transformers , hydrogen is the most common and is generated under most fault conditions ; thus , formation of hydrogen is an early indication of serious problems in the transformer 's life cycle .
Latency results from the methods used to encode and decode the data . Some codecs will analyze a longer segment of the data to optimize efficiency , and then code it in a manner that requires a larger segment of data at one time to decode . ( Often codecs create segments called a " frame " to create discrete data segments for encoding and decoding . ) The inherent latency of the coding algorithm can be critical ; for example , when there is a two-way transmission of data , such as with a telephone conversation , significant delays may seriously degrade the perceived quality .
In the Contemporary era , there were various socio-technological trends . Regarding the 21st century and the late modern world , the Information age and computers were forefront in use , not completely ubiquitous but often present in daily life . The development of Eastern powers was of note , with China and India becoming more powerful . In the Eurasian theater , the European Union and Russian Federation were two forces recently developed . A concern for Western world , if not the whole world , was the late modern form of terrorism and the warfare that has resulted from the contemporary terrorist acts .
The son of an impoverished Bedouin goat herder , Gaddafi became involved in politics while at school in Sabha , subsequently enrolling in the Royal Military Academy , Benghazi . Founding a revolutionary cell within the military , in 1969 they seized power from the absolute monarchy of King Idris in a bloodless coup . Becoming Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council ( RCC ) , Gaddafi abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic . Ruling by decree , he implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya , and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments . Intent on pushing Libya towards " Islamic socialism " , he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system and nationalized the oil industry , using the increased revenues to bolster the military , implement social programs and fund revolutionary militants across the world . In 1973 he initiated a " Popular Revolution " with the formation of General People 's Committees ( GPCs ) , purported to be a system of direct democracy , but retained personal control over major decisions . He outlined his Third International Theory that year , publishing these ideas in The Green Book .
Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born in Houston , Texas , to Celestine Ann " Tina " Knowles ( née Beyincé ) , a hairdresser and salon owner , and Mathew Knowles , a Xerox sales manager . Beyoncé 's name is a tribute to her mother 's maiden name . Beyoncé 's younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former member of Destiny 's Child . Mathew is African-American , while Tina is of Louisiana Creole descent ( with African , Native American , French , Cajun , and distant Irish and Spanish ancestry ) . Through her mother , Beyoncé is a descendant of Acadian leader Joseph Broussard . She was raised in a Methodist household .
Mu'awiyah introduced postal service , Abd al-Malik extended it throughout his empire , and Walid made full use of it . The Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik developed a regular postal service . Umar bin Abdul-Aziz developed it further by building caravanserais at stages along the Khurasan highway . Relays of horses were used for the conveyance of dispatches between the caliph and his agents and officials posted in the provinces . The main highways were divided into stages of 12 miles ( 19 km ) each and each stage had horses , donkeys or camels ready to carry the post . Primarily the service met the needs of Government officials , but travellers and their important dispatches were also benefitted by the system . The postal carriages were also used for the swift transport of troops . They were able to carry fifty to a hundred men at a time . Under Governor Yusuf bin Umar , the postal department of Iraq cost 4,000,000 dirhams a year .
In 2011 , the International Energy Agency said that " the development of affordable , inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits . It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous , inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource , enhance sustainability , reduce pollution , lower the costs of mitigating global warming , and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise . These advantages are global . Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments ; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared " .
The system was originally targeted for release in the spring of 1985 , but the release date was pushed back . After test-marketing in the New York City area in late fall , retailers had reportedly stated the system " failed miserably " . [ contradictory ] While others stated that Nintendo had an excellent nine-week market test in New York last fall Due to the moderate success launch in New York City , Nintendo tried a second time ; the system was test-marketed further beginning in February 1986 , with the nationwide release occurring in September 1986 .
One of the earliest sexual orientation classification schemes was proposed in the 1860s by Karl Heinrich Ulrichs in a series of pamphlets he published privately . The classification scheme , which was meant only to describe males , separated them into three basic categories : dionings , urnings and uranodionings . An urning can be further categorized by degree of effeminacy . These categories directly correspond with the categories of sexual orientation used today : heterosexual , homosexual , and bisexual . In the series of pamphlets , Ulrichs outlined a set of questions to determine if a man was an urning . The definitions of each category of Ulrichs ' classification scheme are as follows :
Another study of dogs ' roles in families showed many dogs have set tasks or routines undertaken as family members , the most common of which was helping with the washing-up by licking the plates in the dishwasher , and bringing in the newspaper from the lawn . Increasingly , human family members are engaging in activities centered on the perceived needs and interests of the dog , or in which the dog is an integral partner , such as dog dancing and dog yoga .
The use of drones by the Central Intelligence Agency in Pakistan to carry out operations associated with the Global War on Terror sparks debate over sovereignty and the laws of war . The U.S. Government uses the CIA rather than the U.S. Air Force for strikes in Pakistan in order to avoid breaching sovereignty through military invasion . The United States was criticized by [ according to whom ? ] a report on drone warfare and aerial sovereignty for abusing the term 'Global War on Terror ' to carry out military operations through government agencies without formally declaring war .
The 15th century was a time of Islamic economic expansion , known as the Valencian Golden Age , in which culture and the arts flourished . Concurrent population growth made Valencia the most populous city in the Crown of Aragon . Local industry , led by textile production , reached a great development , and a financial institution , the Canvi de Taula , was created to support municipal banking operations ; Valencian bankers lent funds to Queen Isabella I of Castile for Columbus 's voyage in 1492 . At the end of the century the Silk Exchange ( Llotja de la Seda ) building was erected as the city became a commercial emporium that attracted merchants from all over Europe .
Unhappy with this change of policy by the Portuguese government , Napoleon sent an army to invade Portugal . On 17 October 1807 , 24,000 French troops under General Junot crossed the Pyrenees with Spanish cooperation and headed towards Portugal to enforce Napoleon 's orders . This attack was the first step in what would eventually become the Peninsular War , a six-year struggle that significantly sapped French strength . Throughout the winter of 1808 , French agents became increasingly involved in Spanish internal affairs , attempting to incite discord between members of the Spanish royal family . On 16 February 1808 , secret French machinations finally materialized when Napoleon announced that he would intervene to mediate between the rival political factions in the country . Marshal Murat led 120,000 troops into Spain and the French arrived in Madrid on 24 March , where wild riots against the occupation erupted just a few weeks later . Napoleon appointed his brother , Joseph Bonaparte , as the new King of Spain in the summer of 1808 . The appointment enraged a heavily religious and conservative Spanish population . Resistance to French aggression soon spread throughout the country . The shocking French defeat at the Battle of Bailén in July gave hope to Napoleon 's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person .
The Hellenistic age also saw a rise in the disillusionment with traditional religion . The rise of philosophy and the sciences had removed the gods from many of their traditional domains such as their role in the movement of the heavenly bodies and natural disasters . The Sophists proclaimed the centrality of humanity and agnosticism ; the belief in Euhemerism ( the view that the gods were simply ancient kings and heroes ) , became popular . The popular philosopher Epicurus promoted a view of disinterested gods living far away from the human realm in metakosmia . The apotheosis of rulers also brought the idea of divinity down to earth . While there does seem to have been a substantial decline in religiosity , this was mostly reserved for the educated classes .
Some systems are capable of multipoint conferencing with no MCU , stand-alone , embedded or otherwise . These use a standards-based H.323 technique known as " decentralized multipoint " , where each station in a multipoint call exchanges video and audio directly with the other stations with no central " manager " or other bottleneck . The advantages of this technique are that the video and audio will generally be of higher quality because they do n't have to be relayed through a central point . Also , users can make ad-hoc multipoint calls without any concern for the availability or control of an MCU . This added convenience and quality comes at the expense of some increased network bandwidth , because every station must transmit to every other station directly .

North Carolina has theme parks , aquariums , museums , historic sites , lighthouses , elegant theaters , concert halls , and fine dining .
In his usurpation of the throne from the Jianwen Emperor ( r. 1398–1402 ) , the Yongle Emperor was aided by the Buddhist monk Yao Guangxiao , and like his father , the Hongwu Emperor , the Yongle Emperor was " well-disposed towards Buddhism " , claims Rossabi . On March 10 , 1403 , the Yongle Emperor invited Deshin Shekpa , 5th Karmapa Lama ( 1384–1415 ) , to his court , even though the fourth Karmapa had rejected the invitation of the Hongwu Emperor . A Tibetan translation in the 16th century preserves the letter of the Yongle Emperor , which the Association for Asian Studies notes is polite and complimentary towards the Karmapa . The letter of invitation reads ,
The National Incident Based Reporting System ( NIBRS ) crime statistics system aims to address limitations inherent in UCR data . The system is used by law enforcement agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes . Local , state , and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their records management systems . Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense category . The Group A offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories . Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system . In addition to the Group A offenses , eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information . The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary-based UCR system . As of 2004 , 5,271 law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data . That amount represents 20 % of the United States population and 16 % of the crime statistics data collected by the FBI .
In 1838 , there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity involving asphalt/bitumen , which had uses beyond paving . For example , asphalt could also used for flooring , damp proofing in buildings , and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths , with these latter themselves proliferating in the 19th century . On the London stockmarket , there were various claims as to the exclusivity of asphalt quality from France , Germany and England . And numerous patents were granted in France , with similar numbers of patent applications being denied in England due to their similarity to each other . In England , " Claridge 's was the type most used in the 1840s and 50s "
Capacitors deviate from the ideal capacitor equation in a number of ways . Some of these , such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear , or can be assumed to be linear , and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of the capacitor . The usual methods of network analysis can then be applied . In other cases , such as with breakdown voltage , the effect is non-linear and normal ( i.e. , linear ) network analysis can not be used , the effect must be dealt with separately . There is yet another group , which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant . Such an example is temperature dependence . Finally , combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance , resistance , or dielectric losses can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation .
Now with NATO support in the form of air cover , the rebel militia pushed westward , defeating loyalist armies and securing control of the centre of the country . Gaining the support of Amazigh ( Berber ) communities of the Nafusa Mountains , who had long been persecuted as non-Arabic speakers under Gaddafi , the NTC armies surrounded Gaddafi loyalists in several key areas of western Libya . In August , the rebels seized Zliten and Tripoli , ending the last vestiges of Gaddafist power . On 25 August , the Arab League recognised the NTC to be " the legitimate representative of the Libyan state " , on which basis Libya would resume its membership in the League .
Treaties may be seen as 'self-executing ' , in that merely becoming a party puts the treaty and all of its obligations in action . Other treaties may be non-self-executing and require 'implementing legislation'—a change in the domestic law of a state party that will direct or enable it to fulfill treaty obligations . An example of a treaty requiring such legislation would be one mandating local prosecution by a party for particular crimes .
After Charles II of England ( 1630–1685 ) was restored to the English throne in 1660 following Oliver Cromwell 's Protectorate , he granted the chartered Province of Carolina to eight of his loyal friends , known as the Lords Proprietors , on March 24 , 1663 . It took seven years before the group arranged for settlement expeditions . The first of these founded Charles Town , in 1670 . Governance , settlement , and development were to follow a visionary plan known as the Grand Model prepared for the Lords Proprietors by John Locke .
North Carolina Museum of Art , occupying a large suburban campus on Blue Ridge Road near the North Carolina State Fairgrounds , maintains one of the premier public art collections located between Washington , D.C. , and Atlanta . In addition to its extensive collections of American Art , European Art and ancient art , the museum recently has hosted major exhibitions featuring Auguste Rodin ( in 2000 ) and Claude Monet ( in 2006-07 ) , each attracting more than 200,000 visitors . Unlike most prominent public museums , the North Carolina Museum of Art acquired a large number of the works in its permanent collection through purchases with public funds . The museum 's outdoor park is one of the largest such art parks in the country . The museum facility underwent a major expansion which greatly expanded the exhibit space that was completed in 2010 . The 127,000 sf new expansion is designed by NYC architect Thomas Phifer and Partners .
In the 2010s , American jurisdictions have experienced a shortage of lethal injection drugs , due to anti-death penalty advocacy and low production volume . Hospira , the only U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental , stopped making the drug in 2011 . The European Union has outlawed the export of any product that could be used in an execution ; this has prevented executioners from using EU-manufactured anesthetics like propofol which are needed for general medical purposes . Another alternative , pentobarbital , is also only manufactured in the European Union , which has caused the Danish producer to restrict distribution to U.S. government customers .
Myanmar has received extensive military aid from China in the past Myanmar has been a member of ASEAN since 1997 . Though it gave up its turn to hold the ASEAN chair and host the ASEAN Summit in 2006 , it chaired the forum and hosted the summit in 2014 . In November 2008 , Myanmar 's political situation with neighbouring Bangladesh became tense as they began searching for natural gas in a disputed block of the Bay of Bengal . Controversy surrounding the Rohingya population also remains an issue between Bangladesh and Myanmar .
The process of morphological derivation in Catalan follows the same principles as the other Romance languages , where agglutination is common . Many times , several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme , and some sound alternations can occur , for example elèctric [ əˈlɛktrik ] ( " electrical " ) vs. electricitat [ ələktrisiˈtat ] . Prefixes are usually appended to verbs , for as in preveure ( " foresee " ) .
The origin of the word antenna relative to wireless apparatus is attributed to Italian radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi . In the summer of 1895 , Marconi began testing his wireless system outdoors on his father 's estate near Bologna and soon began to experiment with long wire " aerials " . Marconi discovered that by raising the " aerial " wire above the ground and connecting the other side of his transmitter to ground , the transmission range was increased . Soon he was able to transmit signals over a hill , a distance of approximately 2.4 kilometres ( 1.5 mi ) . In Italian a tent pole is known as l'antenna centrale , and the pole with the wire was simply called l'antenna . Until then wireless radiating transmitting and receiving elements were known simply as aerials or terminals .
In the Early Middle Ages , from the end of the 4th century , the western extent of modern-day Switzerland was part of the territory of the Kings of the Burgundians . The Alemanni settled the Swiss plateau in the 5th century and the valleys of the Alps in the 8th century , forming Alemannia . Modern-day Switzerland was therefore then divided between the kingdoms of Alemannia and Burgundy . The entire region became part of the expanding Frankish Empire in the 6th century , following Clovis I 's victory over the Alemanni at Tolbiac in 504 AD , and later Frankish domination of the Burgundians .
On 2 June 2013 , The Sun on Sunday ran a front page story on singer-songwriter Tulisa Contostavlos . The front page read : " Tulisa 's cocaine deal shame " ; this story was written by The Sun On Sunday 's undercover reporter Mahzer Mahmood , who had previously worked for the News of the World . It was claimed that Tulisa introduced three film producers ( actually Mahmood and two other Sun journalists ) to a drug dealer and set up a £800 deal . The subterfuge involved conning the singer into believing that she was being considered for a role in an £8 million Bollywood film .
Task Manager has been redesigned , including a new processes tab with the option to display fewer or more details of running applications and background processes , a heat map using different colors indicating the level of resource usage , network and disk counters , grouping by process type ( e.g . applications , background processes and Windows processes ) , friendly names for processes and a new option which allows users to search the web to find information about obscure processes . Additionally , the Blue Screen of Death has been updated with a simpler and modern design with less technical information displayed .
An FBI special agent is issued a Glock Model 22 pistol or a Glock 23 in .40 S & W caliber . If they fail their first qualification , they are issued either a Glock 17 or Glock 19 , to aid in their next qualification . In May 1997 , the FBI officially adopted the Glock .40 S & W pistol for general agent use and first issued it to New Agent Class 98-1 in October 1997 . At present , the Model 23 " FG & R " ( finger groove and rail ) is the issue sidearm . New agents are issued firearms , on which they must qualify , on successful completion of their training at the FBI Academy . The Glock 26 in 9×19mm Parabellum , and Glock Models 23 and 27 in .40 S & W caliber are authorized as secondary weapons . Special agents are authorized to purchase and qualify with the Glock Model 21 in .45 ACP . Special agents of the FBI HRT ( Hostage Rescue Team ) , and regional SWAT teams are issued the Springfield Professional Model 1911A1 .45 ACP pistol ( see FBI Special Weapons and Tactics Teams ) .
Due to its very low elevation , the Marshall Islands are threatened by the potential effects of sea level rise . According to the president of Nauru , the Marshall Islands are the most endangered nation in the world due to flooding from climate change .
In March 2010 , Sony Corp has partnered with The Michael Jackson Company with a contract of more than $ 250 million , the largest deal in recorded music history .
In South Africa , a " two apex " system existed from 1994 to 2013 . The Supreme Court of Appeal ( SCA ) was created in 1994 and replaced the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa as the highest court of appeal in non-constitutional matters . The SCA is subordinate to the Constitutional Court , which is the highest court in matters involving the interpretation and application of the Constitution . But in August 2013 the Constitution was amended to make the Constitutional Court the country 's single apex court , superior to the SCA in all matters , both constitutional and non-constitutional .
Mechanically controlled variable capacitors allow the plate spacing to be adjusted , for example by rotating or sliding a set of movable plates into alignment with a set of stationary plates . Low cost variable capacitors squeeze together alternating layers of aluminum and plastic with a screw . Electrical control of capacitance is achievable with varactors ( or varicaps ) , which are reverse-biased semiconductor diodes whose depletion region width varies with applied voltage . They are used in phase-locked loops , amongst other applications .
Israelites enjoyed political independence twice in ancient history , first during the periods of the Biblical judges followed by the United Monarchy . [ disputed – discuss ] After the fall of the United Monarchy the land was divided into Israel and Judah . The term Jew originated from the Roman " Judean " and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah . The shift of ethnonym from " Israelites " to " Jews " ( inhabitant of Judah ) , although not contained in the Torah , is made explicit in the Book of Esther ( 4th century BCE ) , a book in the Ketuvim , the third section of the Jewish Tanakh . In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar II , King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire , besieged Jerusalem , destroyed the First Temple , and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah . In 586 BC , Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom , and its remaining Jews were left stateless . The Babylonian exile ended in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and Cyrus the Great allowed the exiled Jews to return to Yehud and rebuild their Temple . The Second Temple was completed in 515 BCE . Yehud province was a peaceful part of the Achaemenid Empire until the fall of the Empire in c. 333 BCE to Alexander the Great . Jews were also politically independent during the Hasmonean dynasty spanning from 140 to 37 BCE and to some degree under the Herodian dynasty from 37 BCE to 6 CE . Since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE , most Jews have lived in diaspora . As an ethnic minority in every country in which they live ( except Israel ) , they have frequently experienced persecution throughout history , resulting in a population that has fluctuated both in numbers and distribution over the centuries .

The basic air defence unit is typically a battery with 2 to 12 guns or missile launchers and fire control elements . These batteries , particularly with guns , usually deploy in a small area , although batteries may be split ; this is usual for some missile systems . SHORAD missile batteries often deploy across an area with individual launchers several kilometres apart . When MANPADS is operated by specialists , batteries may have several dozen teams deploying separately in small sections ; self-propelled air defence guns may deploy in pairs .
Culturally , an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit , which means " Jewishness " in the Yiddish language . Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews . Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe , this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men , and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women . From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania , most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew , and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives . But with modernization , Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism , but a broad range of movements , ideologies , practices , and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness . Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish , Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech , in styles of humor , in patterns of association . Broadly speaking , a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews , supports Jewish institutions , reads Jewish books and periodicals , attends Jewish movies and theater , travels to Israel , visits historical synagogues , and so forth . It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general , and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular .
Asphalt/bitumen is typically stored and transported at temperatures around 150 °C ( 302 °F ) . Sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity ; upon delivery , these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture . This mixture is often called " bitumen feedstock " , or BFS . Some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm . The backs of tippers carrying asphalt/bitumen , as well as some handling equipment , are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release . Diesel oil is no longer used as a release agent due to environmental concerns .
Scholars have characterized To Kill a Mockingbird as both a Southern Gothic and coming-of-age or Bildungsroman novel . The grotesque and near-supernatural qualities of Boo Radley and his house , and the element of racial injustice involving Tom Robinson contribute to the aura of the Gothic in the novel . Lee used the term " Gothic " to describe the architecture of Maycomb 's courthouse and in regard to Dill 's exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley . Outsiders are also an important element of Southern Gothic texts and Scout and Jem 's questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel to Catcher in the Rye and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . Despite challenging the town 's systems , Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others , because he believes that following one 's conscience is the highest priority , even when the result is social ostracism . However , scholars debate about the Southern Gothic classification , noting that Boo Radley is in fact human , protective , and benevolent . Furthermore , in addressing themes such as alcoholism , incest , rape , and racial violence , Lee wrote about her small town realistically rather than melodramatically . She portrays the problems of individual characters as universal underlying issues in every society .
Although theoretically a collegial body operating through consensus building , Gaddafi dominated the RCC , although some of the others attempted to constrain what they saw as his excesses . Gaddafi remained the government 's public face , with the identities of the other RCC members only being publicly revealed on 10 January 1970 . All young men from ( typically rural ) working and middle-class backgrounds , none had university degrees ; in this way they were distinct from the wealthy , highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country .
After the Lisa 's announcement , John Dvorak discussed rumors of a mysterious " MacIntosh " project at Apple in February 1983 . The company announced the Macintosh 128K—manufactured at an Apple factory in Fremont , California—in October 1983 , followed by an 18-page brochure included with various magazines in December . The Macintosh was introduced by a US $ 1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial , " 1984 " . It most notably aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22 , 1984 , and is now considered a " watershed event " and a " masterpiece . " Regis McKenna called the ad " more successful than the Mac itself . " " 1984 " used an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh ( indicated by a Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top ) as a means of saving humanity from the " conformity " of IBM 's attempts to dominate the computer industry . The ad alludes to George Orwell 's novel , Nineteen Eighty-Four , which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised " Big Brother . "
Darwin proposes sexual selection , driven by competition between males for mates , to explain sexually dimorphic features such as lion manes , deer antlers , peacock tails , bird songs , and the bright plumage of some male birds . He analysed sexual selection more fully in The Descent of Man , and Selection in Relation to Sex ( 1871 ) . Natural selection was expected to work very slowly in forming new species , but given the effectiveness of artificial selection , he could " see no limit to the amount of change , to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings , one with another and with their physical conditions of life , which may be effected in the long course of time by nature 's power of selection " . Using a tree diagram and calculations , he indicates the " divergence of character " from original species into new species and genera . He describes branches falling off as extinction occurred , while new branches formed in " the great Tree of life ... with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications " .
The exodus of Salvadorans was a result of both economic and political problems . The largest immigration wave occurred as a result of the Salvadoran Civil War in the 1980s , in which 20–30 % of El Salvador 's population emigrated . About 50 % , or up to 500,000 of those who escaped headed to the United States , which was already home to over 10,000 Salvadorans , making Salvadorans Americans the fourth-largest Hispanic and Latino American group , after the Mexican-American majority , stateside Puerto Ricans , and Cubans .
Ancient Egypt made significant advances in astronomy , mathematics and medicine . Their development of geometry was a necessary outgrowth of surveying to preserve the layout and ownership of farmland , which was flooded annually by the Nile river . The 3-4-5 right triangle and other rules of thumb were used to build rectilinear structures , and the post and lintel architecture of Egypt . Egypt was also a center of alchemy research for much of the Mediterranean.The Edwin Smith papyrus is one of the first medical documents still extant , and perhaps the earliest document that attempts to describe and analyse the brain : it might be seen as the very beginnings of modern neuroscience . However , while Egyptian medicine had some effective practices , it was not without its ineffective and sometimes harmful practices . Medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology , for example , was largely ineffective . Nevertheless , it applies the following components to the treatment of disease : examination , diagnosis , treatment , and prognosis , which display strong parallels to the basic empirical method of science and according to G. E. R. Lloyd played a significant role in the development of this methodology . The Ebers papyrus ( c. 1550 BC ) also contains evidence of traditional empiricism .
The city has numerous neighborhoods consisting of vacant properties resulting in low inhabited density in those areas , stretching city services and infrastructure . These neighborhoods are concentrated in the northeast and on the city 's fringes . A 2009 parcel survey found about a quarter of residential lots in the city to be undeveloped or vacant , and about 10 % of the city 's housing to be unoccupied . The survey also reported that most ( 86 % ) of the city 's homes are in good condition with a minority ( 9 % ) in fair condition needing only minor repairs .
Since birds are highly visible and common animals , humans have had a relationship with them since the dawn of man . Sometimes , these relationships are mutualistic , like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and African peoples such as the Borana . Other times , they may be commensal , as when species such as the house sparrow have benefited from human activities . Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests , and some pose an aviation hazard . Human activities can also be detrimental , and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction ( hunting , avian lead poisoning , pesticides , roadkill , and predation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds ) .
Past problems with hydraulic elevators include underground electrolytic destruction of the cylinder and bulkhead , pipe failures , and control failures . Single bulkhead cylinders , typically built prior to a 1972 ASME A17.1 Elevator Safety Code change requiring a second dished bulkhead , were subject to possible catastrophic failure . The code previously permitted only single-bottom hydraulic cylinders . In the event of a cylinder breach , the fluid loss results in uncontrolled down movement of the elevator . This creates two significant hazards : being subject to an impact at the bottom when the elevator stops suddenly and being in the entrance for a potential shear if the rider is partly in the elevator . Because it is impossible to verify the system at all times , the code requires periodic testing of the pressure capability . Another solution to protect against a cylinder blowout is to install a plunger gripping device . One commercially available is known by the marketing name " LifeJacket " . This is a device which , in the event of an uncontrolled downward acceleration , nondestructively grips the plunger and stops the car . A device known as an overspeed or rupture valve is attached to the hydraulic inlet/outlet of the cylinder and is adjusted for a maximum flow rate . If a pipe or hose were to break ( rupture ) , the flow rate of the rupture valve will surpass a set limit and mechanically stop the outlet flow of hydraulic fluid , thus stopping the plunger and the car in the down direction .
The antiquity of this form of writing extends before the invention of paper around the year 100 in China . Note each palm leaf section was only several lines , written longitudinally across the leaf , and bound by twine to the other sections . The outer portion was decorated . The alphabets of Southeast Asia tended to be abugidas , until the arrival of the Europeans , who used words that also ended in consonants , not just vowels . Other forms of official documents , which did not use paper , included Javanese copperplate scrolls . This material would have been more durable than paper in the tropical climate of Southeast Asia .
Today , Estonian society encourages liberty and liberalism , with popular commitment to the ideals of the limited government , discouraging centralised power and corruption . The Protestant work ethic remains a significant cultural staple , and free education is a highly prized institution . Like the mainstream culture in the other Nordic countries , Estonian culture can be seen to build upon the ascetic environmental realities and traditional livelihoods , a heritage of comparatively widespread egalitarianism out of practical reasons ( see : Everyman 's right and universal suffrage ) , and the ideals of closeness to nature and self-sufficiency ( see : summer cottage ) .
Since the middle of the 19th century , Masonic historians have sought the origins of the movement in a series of similar documents known as the Old Charges , dating from the Regius Poem in about 1425 to the beginning of the 18th century . Alluding to the membership of a lodge of operative masons , they relate a mythologised history of the craft , the duties of its grades , and the manner in which oaths of fidelity are to be taken on joining . The fifteenth century also sees the first evidence of ceremonial regalia .
During the board process an officer 's record is reviewed by a selection board at the Air Force Personnel Center at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio , Texas . At the 10 to 11 year mark , captains will take part in a selection board to major . If not selected , they will meet a follow-on board to determine if they will be allowed to remain in the Air Force . Promotion from major to lieutenant colonel is similar and occurs approximately between the thirteen year ( for officers who were promoted to major early " below the zone " ) and the fifteen year mark , where a certain percentage of majors will be selected below zone ( i.e. , " early " ) , in zone ( i.e. , " on time " ) or above zone ( i.e. , " late " ) for promotion to lieutenant colonel . This process will repeat at the 16 year mark ( for officers previously promoted early to major and lieutenant colonel ) to the 21 year mark for promotion to full colonel .
On February 20 , 1863 , Kansas Governor Thomas Carney signed into law a bill creating the state university in Lawrence . The law was conditioned upon a gift from Lawrence of a $ 15,000 endowment fund and a site for the university , in or near the town , of not less than forty acres ( 16 ha ) of land . If Lawrence failed to meet these conditions , Emporia instead of Lawrence would get the university .
The defined dogma of the Immaculate Conception regards original sin only , saying that Mary was preserved from any stain ( in Latin , macula or labes , the second of these two synonymous words being the one used in the formal definition ) . The proclaimed Roman Catholic dogma states " that the most Blessed Virgin Mary , in the first instance of her conception , by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God , in view of the merits of Jesus Christ , the Saviour of the human race , was preserved free from all stain of original sin . " Therefore , being always free from original sin , the doctrine teaches that from her conception Mary received the sanctifying grace that would normally come with baptism after birth .
In 1996 Brewster Kahle , with Bruce Gilliat , developed software to crawl and download all publicly accessible World Wide Web pages , the Gopher hierarchy , the Netnews ( Usenet ) bulletin board system , and downloadable software . The information collected by these " crawlers " does not include all the information available on the Internet , since much of the data is restricted by the publisher or stored in databases that are not accessible . These " crawlers " also respect the robots exclusion standard for websites whose owners opt for them not to appear in search results or be cached . To overcome inconsistencies in partially cached web sites , Archive-It.org was developed in 2005 by the Internet Archive as a means of allowing institutions and content creators to voluntarily harvest and preserve collections of digital content , and create digital archives .
On 12 December 1911 , during the Delhi Durbar , George V , then Emperor of India , along with Queen Mary , his Consort , made the announcement that the capital of the Raj was to be shifted from Calcutta to Delhi , while laying the foundation stone for the Viceroy 's residence in the Coronation Park , Kingsway Camp . The foundation stone of New Delhi was laid by King George V and Queen Mary at the site of Delhi Durbar of 1911 at Kingsway Camp on 15 December 1911 , during their imperial visit . Large parts of New Delhi were planned by Edwin Lutyens ( Sir Edwin from 1918 ) , who first visited Delhi in 1912 , and Herbert Baker ( Sir Herbert from 1926 ) , both leading 20th-century British architects . The contract was given to Sobha Singh ( later Sir Sobha Singh ) . Construction really began after World War I and was completed by 1931 . The city that was later dubbed " Lutyens ' Delhi " was inaugurated in ceremonies beginning on 10 February 1931 by Lord Irwin , the Viceroy . Lutyens designed the central administrative area of the city as a testament to Britain 's imperial aspirations .
A capacitor consists of two conductors separated by a non-conductive region . The non-conductive region is called the dielectric . In simpler terms , the dielectric is just an electrical insulator . Examples of dielectric media are glass , air , paper , vacuum , and even a semiconductor depletion region chemically identical to the conductors . A capacitor is assumed to be self-contained and isolated , with no net electric charge and no influence from any external electric field . The conductors thus hold equal and opposite charges on their facing surfaces , and the dielectric develops an electric field . In SI units , a capacitance of one farad means that one coulomb of charge on each conductor causes a voltage of one volt across the device .
The performance of " Summertime " by Barrino , later known simply as " Fantasia " , at Top 8 was widely praised , and Simon Cowell considered it as his favorite Idol moment in the nine seasons he was on the show . Fantasia and Diana DeGarmo were the last two finalists , and Fantasia was crowned as the winner . Fantasia released as her coronation single " I Believe " , a song co-written by season one finalist Tamyra Gray , and DeGarmo released " Dreams " . Fantasia went on to gain some successes as a recording artist , while Hudson , who placed seventh , became the only Idol contestant so far to win both an Academy Award and a Grammy .
The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world , broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people . In the 2014–15 season , the average Premier League match attendance exceeded 36,000 , second highest of any professional football league behind the Bundesliga 's 43,500 . Most stadium occupancies are near capacity . The Premier League rank second in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons .
Because of its limited land area , Bermuda has had difficulty with over-population . In the first two centuries of settlement , it relied on steady human emigration to keep the population manageable . [ citation needed ] Before the American Revolution more than ten thousand Bermudians ( over half of the total population through the years ) gradually emigrated , primarily to the Southern United States . As Great Britain displaced Spain as the dominant European imperial power , it opened up more land for colonial development . A steady trickle of outward migration continued . With seafaring the only real industry in the early decades , by the end of the 18th century , at least a third of the island 's manpower was at sea at any one time .
Almost 60 years later , 80 year old career criminal Henry ( Harry ) James Burge claimed to have committed the theft , confessing to a newspaper , with the story being published in the Sunday Pictorial newspaper on 23 February 1958 . He claimed to have carried out the robbery with two other men , although when discrepancies with a contemporaneous report in the Birmingham Post newspaper ( the crime pre-dated written police reports ) in his account of the means of entry and other items stolen , detectives decided there was no realistic possibility of a conviction and the case was closed . Burge claimed the cup had been melted down to make counterfeit half-crown coins , which matched known intelligence of the time , in which stolen silver was being used to forge coins which were then laundered through betting shops at a local racecourse , although Burge had no past history of forgery in a record of 42 previous convictions for which he had spent 42 years in prison . He had been further imprisoned in 1957 for seven years for theft from cars . Released in 1961 , he died in 1964 .
Doubly fed electric motors have two independent multiphase winding sets , which contribute active ( i.e. , working ) power to the energy conversion process , with at least one of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation . Two independent multiphase winding sets ( i.e. , dual armature ) are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication . Doubly-fed electric motors are machines with an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation . This is twice the constant torque speed range as singly-fed electric machines , which have only one active winding set .
On the Indian subcontinent , the Mughal Empire ruled most of India in the early 18th century . The " classic period " ended with the death and defeat of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707 by the rising Hindu Maratha Empire , although the dynasty continued for another 150 years . During this period , the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions . All the significant monuments of the Mughals , their most visible legacy , date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent , with brilliant literary , artistic , and architectural results . The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the Peshwas , the prime ministers of the Maratha empire . In 1761 , the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states .
The USA PATRIOT Act of October 2001 dramatically reduces restrictions on law enforcement agencies ' ability to search telephone , e-mail communications , medical , financial , and other records ; eases restrictions on foreign intelligence gathering within the United States ; expands the Secretary of the Treasury 's authority to regulate financial transactions , particularly those involving foreign individuals and entities ; and broadens the discretion of law enforcement and immigration authorities in detaining and deporting immigrants suspected of terrorism-related acts . The act also expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism , thus enlarging the number of activities to which the USA PATRIOT Act 's expanded law enforcement powers could be applied . A new Terrorist Finance Tracking Program monitored the movements of terrorists ' financial resources ( discontinued after being revealed by The New York Times ) . Global telecommunication usage , including those with no links to terrorism , is being collected and monitored through the NSA electronic surveillance program . The Patriot Act is still in effect .
After the Nazi Party seized power in January 1933 , the Länder increasingly lost importance . They became administrative regions of a centralised country . Three changes are of particular note : on January 1 , 1934 , Mecklenburg-Schwerin was united with the neighbouring Mecklenburg-Strelitz ; and , by the Greater Hamburg Act ( Groß-Hamburg-Gesetz ) , from April 1 , 1937 , the area of the city-state was extended , while Lübeck lost its independence and became part of the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein .
In the 18 years under the presidency of Edward Malloy , C.S.C. , ( 1987–2005 ) , there was a rapid growth in the school 's reputation , faculty , and resources . He increased the faculty by more than 500 professors ; the academic quality of the student body has improved dramatically , with the average SAT score rising from 1240 to 1360 ; the number of minority students more than doubled ; the endowment grew from $ 350 million to more than $ 3 billion ; the annual operating budget rose from $ 177 million to more than $ 650 million ; and annual research funding improved from $ 15 million to more than $ 70 million . Notre Dame 's most recent [ when ? ] capital campaign raised $ 1.1 billion , far exceeding its goal of $ 767 million , and is the largest in the history of Catholic higher education .
The status of the town was changed by a later charter of Charles I by at once the formal separation from Portsmouth and the recognition of Southampton as a county , In the charter dated 27 June 1640 the formal title of the town became 'The Town and County of the Town of Southampton ' . These charters and Royal Grants , of which there were many , also set out the governance and regulation of the town and port which remained the 'constitution ' of the town until the local government organisation of the later Victorian period which from about 1888 saw the setting up of County Councils across England and Wales and including Hampshire County Council who now took on some of the function of Government in Southampton Town . In this regime , The Town and County of the Town of Southampton also became a county borough with shared responsibility for aspects of local government . On 24 February 1964 the status changed again by a Charter of Elizabeth II , creating the City and County of the City of Southampton .
Medical facilities in Mali are very limited , and medicines are in short supply . Malaria and other arthropod-borne diseases are prevalent in Mali , as are a number of infectious diseases such as cholera and tuberculosis . Mali 's population also suffers from a high rate of child malnutrition and a low rate of immunization . An estimated 1.9 percent of the adult and children population was afflicted with HIV/AIDS that year , among the lowest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa . An estimated 85–91 percent of Mali 's girls and women have had female genital mutilation ( 2006 and 2001 data ) .
American Idol is an American singing competition series created by Simon Fuller and produced by 19 Entertainment , and is distributed by FremantleMedia North America . It began airing on Fox on June 11 , 2002 , as an addition to the Idols format based on the British series Pop Idol and has since become one of the most successful shows in the history of American television . The concept of the series is to find new solo recording artists , with the winner being determined by the viewers in America . Winners chosen by viewers through telephone , Internet , and SMS text voting were Kelly Clarkson , Ruben Studdard , Fantasia Barrino , Carrie Underwood , Taylor Hicks , Jordin Sparks , David Cook , Kris Allen , Lee DeWyze , Scotty McCreery , Phillip Phillips , Candice Glover , Caleb Johnson , and Nick Fradiani .
The Qing dynasty was founded not by Han Chinese , who constitute the majority of the Chinese population , but by a sedentary farming people known as the Jurchen , a Tungusic people who lived around the region now comprising the Chinese provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang . The Manchus are sometimes mistaken for a nomadic people , which they were not . What was to become the Manchu state was founded by Nurhaci , the chieftain of a minor Jurchen tribe – the Aisin Gioro – in Jianzhou in the early 17th century . Originally a vassal of the Ming emperors , Nurhachi embarked on an intertribal feud in 1582 that escalated into a campaign to unify the nearby tribes . By 1616 , he had sufficiently consolidated Jianzhou so as to be able to proclaim himself Khan of the Great Jin in reference to the previous Jurchen dynasty .
The Czech dialects spoken in Moravia and Silesia are known as Moravian ( moravština ) . In the Austro-Hungarian Empire , " Bohemian-Moravian-Slovak " was a language citizens could register as speaking ( with German , Polish and several others ) . Of the Czech dialects , only Moravian is distinguished in nationwide surveys by the Czech Statistical Office . As of 2011 , 62,908 Czech citizens spoke Moravian as their first language and 45,561 were diglossal ( speaking Moravian and standard Czech as first languages ) .
The Community Tool Box is a public service of the University maintained by the Work Group for Community Health and Development . It is a free , online resource that contains more than 7,000 pages of practical information for promoting community health and development , and is a global resource for both professionals and grassroots groups engaged in the work of community health and development .
Western France , Spain , and other areas skew time zones and shift clocks , in effect observing DST in winter with an extra hour in summer . Nome , Alaska , is at 165°24′ W longitude , which is just west of center of the idealized Samoa Time Zone ( 165° W ) , but Nome observes Alaska Time ( 135° W ) with DST , so it is slightly more than two hours ahead of the sun in winter and three in summer . Double daylight saving time has been used on occasion ; for example , it was used in some European countries during and shortly after World War II when it was referred to as " Double Summer Time " . See British Double Summer Time and Central European Midsummer Time for details .
Burrel 's innovative design , which combined the low production cost of an Apple II with the computing power of Lisa 's CPU , the Motorola 68K , received the attention of Steve Jobs , co-founder of Apple . Realizing that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa , he began to focus his attention on the project . Raskin left the team in 1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs . Team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final Macintosh design is closer to Jobs ' ideas than Raskin 's . After hearing of the pioneering GUI technology being developed at Xerox PARC , Jobs had negotiated a visit to see the Xerox Alto computer and its Smalltalk development tools in exchange for Apple stock options . The Lisa and Macintosh user interfaces were influenced by technology seen at Xerox PARC and were combined with the Macintosh group 's own ideas . Jobs also commissioned industrial designer Hartmut Esslinger to work on the Macintosh line , resulting in the " Snow White " design language ; although it came too late for the earliest Macs , it was implemented in most other mid- to late-1980s Apple computers . However , Jobs ' leadership at the Macintosh project did not last ; after an internal power struggle with new CEO John Sculley , Jobs resigned from Apple in 1985 . He went on to found NeXT , another computer company targeting the education market , and did not return until 1997 , when Apple acquired NeXT .
The eleven prefecture-level divisions of Zhejiang are subdivided into 90 county-level divisions ( 36 districts , 20 county-level cities , 33 counties , and one autonomous county ) . Those are in turn divided into 1,570 township-level divisions ( 761 towns , 505 townships , 14 ethnic townships , and 290 subdistricts ) . Hengdian belongs to Jinhua , which is the largest base of shooting films and TV dramas in China . Hengdian is called " China 's Hollywood " .
In a switching circuit , the idea is to simulate , as near as possible , the ideal switch having the properties of open circuit when off , short circuit when on , and an instantaneous transition between the two states . Parameters are chosen such that the " off " output is limited to leakage currents too small to affect connected circuitry ; the resistance of the transistor in the " on " state is too small to affect circuitry ; and the transition between the two states is fast enough not to have a detrimental effect .
According to Sun Jiadong , the chief designer of the navigation system , " Many organizations have been using our system for a while , and they like it very much . "
John 's lack of religious conviction has been noted by contemporary chroniclers and later historians , with some suspecting that John was at best impious , or even atheistic , a very serious issue at the time . Contemporary chroniclers catalogued his various anti-religious habits at length , including his failure to take communion , his blasphemous remarks , and his witty but scandalous jokes about church doctrine , including jokes about the implausibility of the Resurrection . They commented on the paucity of John 's charitable donations to the church . Historian Frank McLynn argues that John 's early years at Fontevrault , combined with his relatively advanced education , may have turned him against the church . Other historians have been more cautious in interpreting this material , noting that chroniclers also reported John 's personal interest in the life of St Wulfstan of Worcester and his friendships with several senior clerics , most especially with Hugh of Lincoln , who was later declared a saint . Financial records show a normal royal household engaged in the usual feasts and pious observances – albeit with many records showing John 's offerings to the poor to atone for routinely breaking church rules and guidance . The historian Lewis Warren has argued that the chronicler accounts were subject to considerable bias and the King was " at least conventionally devout , " citing his pilgrimages and interest in religious scripture and commentaries .
Besides the fibres , pulps may contain fillers such as chalk or china clay , which improve its characteristics for printing or writing . Additives for sizing purposes may be mixed with it and/or applied to the paper web later in the manufacturing process ; the purpose of such sizing is to establish the correct level of surface absorbency to suit ink or paint .
From the early 12th century , French builders developed the Gothic style , marked by the use of rib vaults , pointed arches , flying buttresses , and large stained glass windows . It was used mainly in churches and cathedrals , and continued in use until the 16th century in much of Europe . Classic examples of Gothic architecture include Chartres Cathedral and Reims Cathedral in France as well as Salisbury Cathedral in England . Stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches , which continued to use extensive wall-paintings , now almost all lost .
But in statistical mechanics things get more complicated . On one hand , statistical mechanics is far superior to classical thermodynamics , in that thermodynamic behavior , such as glass breaking , can be explained by the fundamental laws of physics paired with a statistical postulate . But statistical mechanics , unlike classical thermodynamics , is time-reversal symmetric . The second law of thermodynamics , as it arises in statistical mechanics , merely states that it is overwhelmingly likely that net entropy will increase , but it is not an absolute law .
Sometimes circumstances such as a good breeding season followed by a food source failure the following year lead to irruptions in which large numbers of a species move far beyond the normal range . Bohemian waxwings Bombycilla garrulus well show this unpredictable variation in annual numbers , with five major arrivals in Britain during the nineteenth century , but 18 between the years 1937 and 2000 . Red crossbills Loxia curvirostra too are irruptive , with widespread invasions across England noted in 1251 , 1593 , 1757 , and 1791 .
Vinyl records can be warped by heat , improper storage , exposure to sunlight , or manufacturing defects such as excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap on the album cover . A small degree of warp was common , and allowing for it was part of the art of turntable and tonearm design . " wow " ( once-per-revolution pitch variation ) could result from warp , or from a spindle hole that was not precisely centered . Standard practice for LPs was to place the LP in a paper or plastic inner cover . This , if placed within the outer cardboard cover so that the opening was entirely within the outer cover , was said to reduce ingress of dust onto the record surface . Singles , with rare exceptions , had simple paper covers with no inner cover .
One adaptation helping both predators and prey avoid detection is camouflage , a form of crypsis where species have an appearance that helps them blend into the background . Camouflage consists of not only color but also shape and pattern . The background upon which the organism is seen can be both its environment ( e.g. , the praying mantis to the right resembling dead leaves ) or other organisms ( e.g. , zebras ' stripes blend in with each other in a herd , making it difficult for lions to focus on a single target ) . The more convincing camouflage is , the more likely it is that the organism will go unseen .
In modular arithmetic , two integers are added and then the sum is divided by a positive integer called the modulus . The result of modular addition is the remainder of that division . For any modulus , n , the set of integers from 0 to n − 1 forms a group under modular addition : the inverse of any element a is n − a , and 0 is the identity element . This is familiar from the addition of hours on the face of a clock : if the hour hand is on 9 and is advanced 4 hours , it ends up on 1 , as shown at the right . This is expressed by saying that 9 + 4 equals 1 " modulo 12 " or , in symbols ,
The FBI often works in conjunction with other Federal agencies , including the U.S. Coast Guard ( USCG ) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) in seaport and airport security , and the National Transportation Safety Board in investigating airplane crashes and other critical incidents . Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations ( ICE-HSI ) has nearly the same amount of investigative man power as the FBI , and investigates the largest range of crimes . In the wake of the September 11 attacks , then-Attorney General Ashcroft assigned the FBI as the designated lead organization in terrorism investigations after the creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security . ICE-HSI and the FBI are both integral members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force .
When interviewed for Mojo magazine the band said the most amazing sight at Live Aid was to see the audience clapping to " Radio Ga Ga " . Brian May stated : " I 'd never seen anything like that in my life and it was n't calculated either . We understood our audience and played to them but that was one of those weird accidents because of the ( music ) video . I remember thinking 'oh great , they 've picked it up ' and then I thought 'this is not a Queen audience ' . This is a general audience who 've bought tickets before they even knew we were on the bill . And they all did it . How did they know ? Nobody told them to do it . "
However , several de facto standards for tag formats exist . As of 2010 , the most widespread are ID3v1 and ID3v2 , and the more recently introduced APEv2 . These tags are normally embedded at the beginning or end of MP3 files , separate from the actual MP3 frame data . MP3 decoders either extract information from the tags , or just treat them as ignorable , non-MP3 junk data .
In 1991 , several manufacturers announced specifications for what would become known as MUSE LaserDisc , representing a span of almost 15 years until the feats of this HD analog optical disc system would finally be duplicated digitally by HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc . Encoded using NHK 's MUSE " Hi-Vision " analogue TV system , MUSE discs would operate like standard LaserDiscs but would contain high-definition 1,125-line ( 1,035 visible lines ) ( Sony HDVS ) video with a 5:3 aspect ratio . The MUSE players were also capable of playing standard NTSC format discs and are superior in performance to non-MUSE players even with these NTSC discs . The MUSE-capable players had several noteworthy advantages over standard LaserDisc players , including a red laser with a much narrower wavelength than the lasers found in standard players . The red laser was capable of reading through disc defects such as scratches and even mild disc rot that would cause most other players to stop , stutter or drop-out . Crosstalk was not an issue with MUSE discs , and the narrow wavelength of the laser allowed for the virtual elimination of crosstalk with normal discs .
When Emperor Kammu moved the capital to Heian-kyō ( Kyōto ) , which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years , he did so not only to strengthen imperial authority but also to improve his seat of government geopolitically . Nara was abandoned after only 70 years in part due to the ascendancy of Dōkyō and the encroaching secular power of the Buddhist institutions there . Kyōto had good river access to the sea and could be reached by land routes from the eastern provinces . The early Heian period ( 784–967 ) continued Nara culture ; the Heian capital was patterned on the Chinese Tang capital at Chang'an , as was Nara , but on a larger scale than Nara . Kammu endeavoured to improve the Tang-style administrative system which was in use . Known as the ritsuryō , this system attempted to recreate the Tang imperium in Japan , despite the " tremendous differences in the levels of development between the two countries " . Despite the decline of the Taika-Taihō reforms , imperial government was vigorous during the early Heian period . Indeed , Kammu 's avoidance of drastic reform decreased the intensity of political struggles , and he became recognized as one of Japan 's most forceful emperors .
In France the Cathars grew to represent a popular mass movement and the belief was spreading to other areas . The Cathar Crusade was initiated by the Roman Catholic Church to eliminate the Cathar heresy in Languedoc . Heresy was a major justification for the Inquisition ( Inquisitio Haereticae Pravitatis , Inquiry on Heretical Perversity ) and for the European wars of religion associated with the Protestant Reformation .
As the Tokugawa period progressed more value became placed on education , and the education of females beginning at a young age became important to families and society as a whole . Marriage criteria began to weigh intelligence and education as desirable attributes in a wife , right along with physical attractiveness . Though many of the texts written for women during the Tokugawa period only pertained to how a woman could become a successful wife and household manager , there were those that undertook the challenge of learning to read , and also tackled philosophical and literary classics . Nearly all women of the samurai class were literate by the end of the Tokugawa period .
The Ottoman Empire , believed to be about to collapse , was portrayed in the press as the sick man of Europe " . The Balkan states , with the partial exception of Bosnia and Albania , were primarily Christian . Starting in 1894 the Ottomans struck at the Armenians on the explicit grounds that they were a non-Muslim people and as such were a potential threat to the Muslim empire within which they resided . The Hamidian Massacres aroused the indignation of the entire Christian world . In the United States the now aging Julia Ward Howe , author of the Battle Hymn of the Republic , leaped into the war of words and joined the Red Cross . Relations of minorities within the Ottoman Empire and the disposition of former Ottoman lands became known as the " Eastern Question , " as the Ottomans were on the east of Europe .
Fryderyk Chopin was born in Żelazowa Wola , 46 kilometres ( 29 miles ) west of Warsaw , in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw , a Polish state established by Napoleon . The parish baptismal record gives his birthday as 22 February 1810 , and cites his given names in the Latin form Fridericus Franciscus ( in Polish , he was Fryderyk Franciszek ) . However , the composer and his family used the birthdate 1 March , [ n 2 ] which is now generally accepted as the correct date .
In 2000 , TCM started the annual Young Composers Film Competition , inviting aspiring composers to participate in a judged competition that offers the winner of each year 's competition the opportunity to score a restored , feature-length silent film as a grand prize , mentored by a well-known composer , with the new work subsequently premiering on the network . As of 2006 , films that have been rescored include the 1921 Rudolph Valentino film Camille , two Lon Chaney films : 1921 's The Ace of Hearts and 1928 's Laugh , Clown , Laugh , and Greta Garbo 's 1926 film The Temptress .
The cantons have a permanent constitutional status and , in comparison with the situation in other countries , a high degree of independence . Under the Federal Constitution , all 26 cantons are equal in status . Each canton has its own constitution , and its own parliament , government and courts . However , there are considerable differences between the individual cantons , most particularly in terms of population and geographical area . Their populations vary between 15,000 ( Appenzell Innerrhoden ) and 1,253,500 ( Zürich ) , and their area between 37 km2 ( 14 sq mi ) ( Basel-Stadt ) and 7,105 km2 ( 2,743 sq mi ) ( Graubünden ) . The Cantons comprise a total of 2,485 municipalities . Within Switzerland there are two enclaves : Büsingen belongs to Germany , Campione d'Italia belongs to Italy .
Despite this , the Austrians , under the command of General Laudon , captured Glatz ( now Kłodzko , Poland ) in Silesia . In the Battle of Liegnitz Frederick scored a strong victory despite being outnumbered three to one . The Russians under General Saltykov and Austrians under General Lacy briefly occupied his capital , Berlin , in October , but could not hold it for long . The end of that year saw Frederick once more victorious , defeating the able Daun in the Battle of Torgau ; but he suffered very heavy casualties , and the Austrians retreated in good order .
The republic was a confederation of seven provinces , which had their own governments and were very independent , and a number of so-called Generality Lands . The latter were governed directly by the States General ( Staten-Generaal in Dutch ) , the federal government . The States General were seated in The Hague and consisted of representatives of each of the seven provinces . The provinces of the republic were , in official feudal order :
The first ground attack came at the Battle of Umm Qasr on 21 March 2003 when a combined force of British , American and Polish forces seized control of the port city of Umm Qasr . Baghdad , Iraq 's capital city , fell to American forces in April 2003 and Saddam Hussein 's government quickly dissolved . On 1 May 2003 , Bush announced that major combat operations in Iraq had ended . However , an insurgency arose against the U.S.-led coalition and the newly developing Iraqi military and post-Saddam government . The insurgency , which included al-Qaeda affiliated groups , led to far more coalition casualties than the invasion . Other elements of the insurgency were led by fugitive members of President Hussein 's Ba'ath regime , which included Iraqi nationalists and pan-Arabists . Many insurgency leaders are Islamists and claim to be fighting a religious war to reestablish the Islamic Caliphate of centuries past . Iraq 's former president , Saddam Hussein was captured by U.S. forces in December 2003 . He was executed in 2006 .
The " photoelectrons " emitted as a result of the photoelectric effect have a certain kinetic energy , which can be measured . This kinetic energy ( for each photoelectron ) is independent of the intensity of the light , but depends linearly on the frequency ; and if the frequency is too low ( corresponding to a photon energy that is less than the work function of the material ) , no photoelectrons are emitted at all , unless a plurality of photons , whose energetic sum is greater than the energy of the photoelectrons , acts virtually simultaneously ( multiphoton effect ) Assuming the frequency is high enough to cause the photoelectric effect , a rise in intensity of the light source causes more photoelectrons to be emitted with the same kinetic energy , rather than the same number of photoelectrons to be emitted with higher kinetic energy .
The changing world order that the war had brought about , in particular the growth of the United States and Japan as naval powers , and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland , caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy . Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan , Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty , where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States . This decision was the source of much debate in Britain during the 1930s as militaristic governments took hold in Japan and Germany helped in part by the Great Depression , for it was feared that the empire could not survive a simultaneous attack by both nations . Although the issue of the empire 's security was a serious concern in Britain , at the same time the empire was vital to the British economy .
Executive vice governor Wei Hong confirmed on November 21 , 2008 that more than 90,000 people in total were dead or missing in the earthquake . He stated that 200,000 homes had been rebuilt , and 685,000 were under reconstruction , but 1.94 million households were still without permanent shelter . 1,300 schools had been reconstructed , with initial relocation of 25 townships , including Beichuan and Wenchuan , two of the most devastated areas . The government spent $ 441 billion on relief and reconstruction efforts .
Based on earlier transmitted reports , in the year 632 , after the demise of Muhammad a number of his companions who knew the Quran by heart were killed in a battle by Musaylimah , the first caliph Abu Bakr ( d. 634 ) decided to collect the book in one volume so that it could be preserved . Zayd ibn Thabit ( d. 655 ) was the person to collect the Quran since " he used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah 's Apostle " . Thus , a group of scribes , most importantly Zayd , collected the verses and produced a hand-written manuscript of the complete book . The manuscript according to Zayd remained with Abu Bakr until he died . Zayd 's reaction to the task and the difficulties in collecting the Quranic material from parchments , palm-leaf stalks , thin stones and from men who knew it by heart is recorded in earlier narratives . After Abu Bakr , Hafsa bint Umar , Muhammad 's widow , was entrusted with the manuscript . In about 650 , the third Caliph Uthman ibn Affan ( d. 656 ) began noticing slight differences in pronunciation of the Quran as Islam expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia , the Levant , and North Africa . In order to preserve the sanctity of the text , he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use Abu Bakr 's copy and prepare a standard copy of the Quran . Thus , within 20 years of Muhammad 's death , the Quran was committed to written form . That text became the model from which copies were made and promulgated throughout the urban centers of the Muslim world , and other versions are believed to have been destroyed . The present form of the Quran text is accepted by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr .
John Locke , one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers , based his governance philosophy in social contract theory , a subject that permeated Enlightenment political thought . The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes ushered in this new debate with his work Leviathan in 1651 . Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European liberal thought : the right of the individual ; the natural equality of all men ; the artificial character of the political order ( which led to the later distinction between civil society and the state ) ; the view that all legitimate political power must be " representative " and based on the consent of the people ; and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid .
The success of its football team made Notre Dame a household name . The success of Note Dame reflected rising status of Irish Americans and Catholics in the 1920s . Catholics rallied up around the team and listen to the games on the radio , especially when it knocked off the schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America — Harvard , Yale , Princeton , and Army . Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism . The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924 . Nativism and anti-Catholicism , especially when directed towards immigrants , were cornerstones of the KKK 's rhetoric , and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic Church . The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend . Clashes with the student body started on March 17 , when students , aware of the anti-Catholic animosity , blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia . On May 19 thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern , and only the arrival of college president Fr . Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes . The next day , football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey the college president and refrain from further violence . A few days later the Klavern broke up , but the hostility shown by the students was an omen and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana .
Many species of the second major avialan lineage to diversify , the Euornithes ( meaning " true birds " , because they include the ancestors of modern birds ) , were semi-aquatic and specialized in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms . Unlike the enantiornithes , which dominated land-based and arboreal habitats , most early euornithes lacked perching adaptations and seem to have included shorebird-like species , waders , and swimming and diving species . The later included the superficially gull-like Ichthyornis , the Hesperornithiformes , which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic . The early euornithes also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds , like strongly keeled breastbones , toothless , beaked portions of their jaws ( though most non-avian euornithes retained teeth in other parts of the jaws ) . Euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true pygostyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers , which may have replaced the " hind wing " as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight .
In 1966 , Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level . Vassar , then all-female and part of the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when the Ivy League still only admitted men—tentatively accepted , but then declined the invitation . Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969 . Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate ; she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society , St. Anthony Hall . The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year ; at the time , all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus .

Suffering ( Pāli : दुक्ख dukkha ; Sanskrit दुःख duḥkha ) is also a central concept in Buddhism . The word roughly corresponds to a number of terms in English including suffering , pain , unsatisfactoriness , sorrow , affliction , anxiety , dissatisfaction , discomfort , anguish , stress , misery , and frustration . Although the term is often translated as " suffering " , its philosophical meaning is more analogous to " disquietude " as in the condition of being disturbed . As such , " suffering " is too narrow a translation with " negative emotional connotations " [ web 9 ] that can give the impression that the Buddhist view is pessimistic , but Buddhism seeks to be neither pessimistic nor optimistic , but realistic . In English-language Buddhist literature translated from Pāli , " dukkha " is often left untranslated , so as to encompass its full range of meaning . [ note 8 ]
The basic annelid form consists of multiple segments . Each segment has the same sets of organs and , in most polychaetes , has a pair of parapodia that many species use for locomotion . Septa separate the segments of many species , but are poorly defined or absent in others , and Echiura and Sipuncula show no obvious signs of segmentation . In species with well-developed septa , the blood circulates entirely within blood vessels , and the vessels in segments near the front ends of these species are often built up with muscles that act as hearts . The septa of such species also enable them to change the shapes of individual segments , which facilitates movement by peristalsis ( " ripples " that pass along the body ) or by undulations that improve the effectiveness of the parapodia . In species with incomplete septa or none , the blood circulates through the main body cavity without any kind of pump , and there is a wide range of locomotory techniques – some burrowing species turn their pharynges inside out to drag themselves through the sediment .
After the Marzpanate period ( 428–636 ) , Armenia emerged as the Emirate of Armenia , an autonomous principality within the Arabic Empire , reuniting Armenian lands previously taken by the Byzantine Empire as well . The principality was ruled by the Prince of Armenia , and recognized by the Caliph and the Byzantine Emperor . It was part of the administrative division/emirate Arminiya created by the Arabs , which also included parts of Georgia and Caucasian Albania , and had its center in the Armenian city , Dvin . The Principality of Armenia lasted until 884 , when it regained its independence from the weakened Arab Empire under King Ashot I Bagratuni .
Religious Jews have Minhagim , customs , in addition to Halakha , or religious law , and different interpretations of law . Different groups of religious Jews in different geographic areas historically adopted different customs and interpretations . On certain issues , Orthodox Jews are required to follow the customs of their ancestors , and do not believe they have the option of picking and choosing . For this reason , observant Jews at times find it important for religious reasons to ascertain who their household 's religious ancestors are in order to know what customs their household should follow . These times include , for example , when two Jews of different ethnic background marry , when a non-Jew converts to Judaism and determines what customs to follow for the first time , or when a lapsed or less observant Jew returns to traditional Judaism and must determine what was done in his or her family 's past . In this sense , " Ashkenazic " refers both to a family ancestry and to a body of customs binding on Jews of that ancestry . Reform Judaism , which does not necessarily follow those minhagim , did nonetheless originate among Ashkenazi Jews .
According to the 2010 revison of the UN World Population Prospects , Guinea-Bissau 's population was 1,515,000 in 2010 , compared to 518,000 in 1950 . The proportion of the population below the age of 15 in 2010 was 41.3 % , 55.4 % were aged between 15 and 65 years of age , while 3.3 % were aged 65 years or older .
West Raleigh lies along Hillsborough Street and Western Boulevard . The area is bordered to the west by suburban Cary . It is home to North Carolina State University , Meredith College , Pullen Park , Pullen Memorial Baptist Church , Cameron Village , Lake Johnson , the North Carolina Museum of Art and historic Saint Mary 's School . Primary thoroughfares serving West Raleigh , in addition to Hillsborough Street , are Avent Ferry Road , Blue Ridge Road , and Western Boulevard . The PNC Arena is also located here adjacent to the North Carolina State Fairgrounds . These are located approximately 2 miles from Rex Hospital .
Satyagraha , an opera by Philip Glass , uses texts from the Bhagavad Gita , sung in Sanskrit . The closing credits of The Matrix Revolutions has a prayer from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad . The song " Cyber-raga " from Madonna 's album Music includes Sanskrit chants , and Shanti/Ashtangi from her 1998 album Ray of Light , which won a Grammy , is the ashtanga vinyasa yoga chant . The lyrics include the mantra Om shanti . Composer John Williams featured choirs singing in Sanskrit for Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and in Star Wars : Episode I – The Phantom Menace . The theme song of Battlestar Galactica 2004 is the Gayatri Mantra , taken from the Rigveda . The lyrics of " The Child In Us " by Enigma also contains Sanskrit verses . [ better source needed ] .
The region is serviced by 4,200 km ( 2,600 mi ) of roads used by 6 million vehicles . Train travel is well established in the Alps , with , for instance 120 km ( 75 mi ) of track for every 1,000 km2 ( 390 sq mi ) in a country such as Switzerland . Most of Europe 's highest railways are located there . Moreover , plans are underway to build a 57 km ( 35 mi ) -long sub-alpine tunnel connecting the older Lötschberg and Gotthard tunnels built in the 19th century .
On 7 June 1950 , Kim Il-sung called for a Korea-wide election on 5–8 August 1950 and a consultative conference in Haeju on 15–17 June 1950 . On 11 June , the North sent three diplomats to the South , as a peace overture that Rhee rejected . On 21 June , Kim Il-Sung revised his war plan to involve general attack across the 38th parallel , rather than a limited operation in the Ongjin peninsula . Kim was concerned that South Korean agents had learned about the plans and South Korean forces were strengthening their defenses . Stalin agreed to this change of plan .
Hunting and gathering was presumably the subsistence strategy employed by human societies beginning some 1.8 million years ago , by Homo erectus , and from its appearance some 0.2 million years ago by Homo sapiens . It remained the only mode of subsistence until the end of the Mesolithic period some 10,000 years ago , and after this was replaced only gradually with the spread of the Neolithic Revolution .
To differentiate Nintendo 's new home platform from the early 1980s ' common perception of a troubled and shallow video game market , the company freshened its product nomenclature and positioning , and it established a strict product approval and licensing policy . The overall system was referred to as an " Entertainment System " instead of a " video game system " , which was centered upon a machine called a " Control Deck " instead of a " console " , and which featured software cartridges called " Game Paks " instead of " video games " . The 10NES lockout chip system acted as a lock-and-key coupling of each Game Pak and Control Deck , deterring the copying or production of NES games which had not first achieved Nintendo 's licensed approval . The packaging of the launch lineup of NES games bore pictures of a very close representation of the actual onscreen graphics of the game , which were of sufficiently recognizable quality on their own . Symbols on the launch games ' packaging clearly indicated the genre of the game , in order to reduce consumer confusion . A 'seal of quality ' was printed on all appropriately licensed game and accessory packaging . The initial seal stated , " This seal is your assurance that Nintendo has approved and guaranteed the quality of this product " . This text was later changed to " Official Nintendo Seal of Quality " .
In the 2005 National Family Health Survey , it was reported that the city 's total fertility rate is 1.8 , :47 which is below the replacement rate . Only 61 % of children had been provided with all basic vaccines ( BCG , measles and full courses of polio and DPT ) , fewer than in all other surveyed cities except Meerut . :98 The infant mortality rate was 35 per 1,000 live births , and the mortality rate for children under five was 41 per 1,000 live births . :97 The survey also reported that a third of women and a quarter of men are overweight or obese , 49 % of children below 5 years are anaemic , and up to 20 % of children are underweight , :44 , 55–56 while more than 2 % of women and 3 % of men suffer from diabetes . :57
Photometric studies ( also sometimes referred to as " layouts " or " point by points " ) are often used to simulate lighting designs for projects before they are built or renovated . This enables architects , lighting designers , and engineers to determine whether a proposed lighting setup will deliver the amount of light intended . They will also be able to determine the contrast ratio between light and dark areas . In many cases these studies are referenced against IESNA or CIBSE recommended lighting practices for the type of application . Depending on the type of area , different design aspects may be emphasized for safety or practicality ( i.e . such as maintaining uniform light levels , avoiding glare or highlighting certain areas ) . Specialized software is often used to create these , which typically combine the use of two-dimensional digital CAD drawings and lighting calculation software ( i.e . AGi32or Dialux ) .
Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the American Anthropological Association 's annual meeting in 1993 . The sub-group was very closely related to STS and the Society for the Social Studies of Science . Donna Haraway 's 1985 Cyborg Manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term . Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built , specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings .
While many secular buildings exist from the Late Middle Ages , it is in the buildings of cathedrals and great churches that Gothic architecture displays its pertinent structures and characteristics to the fullest advantage . A Gothic cathedral or abbey was , prior to the 20th century , generally the landmark building in its town , rising high above all the domestic structures and often surmounted by one or more towers and pinnacles and perhaps tall spires . These cathedrals were the skyscrapers of that day and would have been the largest buildings by far that Europeans would ever have seen . It is in the architecture of these Gothic churches that a unique combination of existing technologies established the emergence of a new building style . Those technologies were the ogival or pointed arch , the ribbed vault , and the buttress .
The term prime minister in the sense that we know it originated in the 18th century in the United Kingdom when members of parliament disparagingly used the title in reference to Sir Robert Walpole . Over time , the title became honorific and remains so in the 21st century .
There were several other kingdoms which ruled over parts of India in the later medieval period prior to the British occupation . However , most of them were bound to pay regular tribute to the Marathas . The rule of Wodeyar dynasty which established the Kingdom of Mysore in southern India in around 1400 CE by was interrupted by Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan in the later half of the 18th century . Under their rule , Mysore fought a series of wars sometimes against the combined forces of the British and Marathas , but mostly against the British , with Mysore receiving some aid or promise of aid from the French .
The word phonology ( as in the phonology of English ) can also refer to the phonological system ( sound system ) of a given language . This is one of the fundamental systems which a language is considered to comprise , like its syntax and its vocabulary .
This is not surprising , though : While the greatest number of slaves imported from Africa were sent to Brazil , totalizing roughly 3.5 million people , they lived in such miserable conditions that male African Y-DNA there is significantly rare due to the lack of resources and time involved with raising of children , so that most African descent originarily came from relations between white masters and female slaves . From the last decades of the Empire until the 1950s , the proportion of the white population increased significantly while Brazil welcomed 5.5 million immigrants between 1821 and 1932 , not much behind its neighbor Argentina with 6.4 million , and it received more European immigrants in its colonial history than the United States . Between 1500 and 1760 , 700.000 Europeans settled in Brazil , while 530.000 Europeans settled in the United States for the same given time . Thus , the historical construction of race in Brazilian society dealt primarily with gradations between persons of majoritarily European ancestry and little minority groups with otherwise lower quantity therefrom in recent times .
Another important factor is the apparent consensus among Western great powers that military force is no longer an effective tool of resolving disputes among their peers . This " subset " of great powers – France , Germany , Japan , the United Kingdom and the United States – consider maintaining a " state of peace " as desirable . As evidence , Baron outlines that since the Cuban missile crisis ( 1962 ) during the Cold War , these influential Western nations have resolved all disputes among the great powers peacefully at the United Nations and other forums of international discussion .
The great majority of asphalt used commercially is obtained from petroleum . Nonetheless , large amounts of asphalt occur in concentrated form in nature . Naturally occurring deposits of asphalt/bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient , microscopic algae ( diatoms ) and other once-living things . These remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where the organisms lived . Under the heat ( above 50 °C ) and pressure of burial deep in the earth , the remains were transformed into materials such as asphalt/bitumen , kerogen , or petroleum .
Tibetan sources say Deshin Shekpa also persuaded the Yongle Emperor not to impose his military might on Tibet as the Mongols had previously done . Thinley writes that before the Karmapa returned to Tibet , the Yongle Emperor began planning to send a military force into Tibet to forcibly give the Karmapa authority over all the Tibetan Buddhist schools but Deshin Shekpa dissuaded him . However , Hok-Lam Chan states that " there is little evidence that this was ever the emperor 's intention " and that evidence indicates that Deshin Skekpa was invited strictly for religious purposes .
By contrast , the Habsburg frontier had settled somewhat , a stalemate caused by a stiffening of the Habsburg defences . The Long War against Habsburg Austria ( 1593–1606 ) created the need for greater numbers of Ottoman infantry equipped with firearms , resulting in a relaxation of recruitment policy . This contributed to problems of indiscipline and outright rebelliousness within the corps , which were never fully solved . Irregular sharpshooters ( Sekban ) were also recruited , and on demobilization turned to brigandage in the Jelali revolts ( 1595–1610 ) , which engendered widespread anarchy in Anatolia in the late 16th and early 17th centuries . With the Empire 's population reaching 30 million people by 1600 , the shortage of land placed further pressure on the government . In spite of these problems , the Ottoman state remained strong , and its army did not collapse or suffer crushing defeats . The only exceptions were campaigns against the Safavid dynasty of Persia , where many of the Ottoman eastern provinces were lost , some permanently . This 1603–1618 war eventually resulted in the Treaty of Nasuh Pasha , which ceded the entire Caucasus , except westernmost Georgia , back into Iranian Safavid possession . Campaigns during this era became increasingly inconclusive , even against weaker states with much smaller forces , such as Poland or Austria .
In 2013 it was found that the Ministry of Defence had overspent on its equipment budget by £6.5bn on orders that could take up to 39 years to fulfil . The Ministry of Defence has been criticised in the past for poor management and financial control , investing in projects that have taken up to 10 and even as much as 15 years to be delivered .
Canonical jurisprudential theory generally follows the principles of Aristotelian-Thomistic legal philosophy . While the term " law " is never explicitly defined in the Code , the Catechism of the Catholic Church cites Aquinas in defining law as " ... an ordinance of reason for the common good , promulgated by the one who is in charge of the community " and reformulates it as " ... a rule of conduct enacted by competent authority for the sake of the common good . "
The wastewater treatment plant and distribution system of water mains , pumping stations and storage facilities provide water to approximately 62,000 customers in the city . There is also a wastewater treatment plant located on the south bank of the James River . This plant can treat up to 70 million gallons of water per day of sanitary sewage and stormwater before returning it to the river . The wastewater utility also operates and maintains 1,500 miles ( 2,400 km ) of sanitary sewer and pumping stations , 38 miles ( 61 km ) of intercepting sewer lines , and the Shockoe Retention Basin , a 44-million-gallon stormwater reservoir used during heavy rains .
There were 230,233 households , 29.4 % of which had children under the age of 18 living with them , 43.4 % were married couples living together , 13.9 % had a female householder with no husband present , and 37.4 % were non-families . One person households account for 30.5 % of all households and 8.7 % of all households had someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older . The average household size was 2.47 and the average family size was 3.11 .
The radish is also a typical food representing people of Nanjing , which has been spread through word of mouth as an interesting fact for many years in China . According to Nanjing.GOV.cn , " There is a long history of growing radish in Nanjing especially the southern suburb . In the spring , the radish tastes very juicy and sweet . It is well-known that people in Nanjing like eating radish . And the people are even addressed as 'Nanjing big radish ' , which means they are unsophisticated , passionate and conservative . From health perspective , eating radish can help to offset the stodgy food that people take during the Spring Festival " .
The Gurjar Pratihar Empire acted as a barrier for Arab invaders from the 8th to the 11th century . The chief accomplishment of the Gurjara Pratihara empire lies in its successful resistance to foreign invasions from the west , starting in the days of Junaid . Historian R. C. Majumdar says that this was openly acknowledged by the Arab writers . He further notes that historians of India have wondered at the slow progress of Muslim invaders in India , as compared with their rapid advance in other parts of the world . Now there seems little doubt that it was the power of the Gurjara Pratihara army that effectively barred the progress of the Arabs beyond the confines of Sindh , their first conquest for nearly 300 years .
In dominant-party systems , opposition parties are allowed , and there may be even a deeply established democratic tradition , but other parties are widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power . Sometimes , political , social and economic circumstances , and public opinion are the reason for others parties ' failure . Sometimes , typically in countries with less of an established democratic tradition , it is possible the dominant party will remain in power by using patronage and sometimes by voting fraud . In the latter case , the definition between dominant and one-party system becomes rather blurred . Examples of dominant party systems include the People 's Action Party in Singapore , the African National Congress in South Africa , the Cambodian People 's Party in Cambodia , the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan , and the National Liberation Front in Algeria . One-party dominant system also existed in Mexico with the Institutional Revolutionary Party until the 1990s , in the southern United States with the Democratic Party from the late 19th century until the 1970s , in Indonesia with the Golkar from the early 1970s until 1998 .
The Soviet Union created the Eastern Bloc of countries that it occupied , annexing some as Soviet Socialist Republics and maintaining others as satellite states that would later form the Warsaw Pact . The United States and various western European countries began a policy of " containment " of communism and forged myriad alliances to this end , including NATO . Several of these western countries also coordinated efforts regarding the rebuilding of western Europe , including western Germany , which the Soviets opposed . In other regions of the world , such as Latin America and Southeast Asia , the Soviet Union fostered communist revolutionary movements , which the United States and many of its allies opposed and , in some cases , attempted to " roll back " . Many countries were prompted to align themselves with the nations that would later form either NATO or the Warsaw Pact , though other movements would also emerge .

Utrecht 's cityscape is dominated by the Dom Tower , the tallest belfry in the Netherlands and originally part of the Cathedral of Saint Martin . An ongoing debate is over whether any building in or near the centre of town should surpass the Dom Tower in height ( 112 m ) . Nevertheless , some tall buildings are now being constructed that will become part of the skyline of Utrecht . The second tallest building of the city , the Rabobank-tower , was completed in 2010 and stands 105 m ( 344.49 ft ) tall . Two antennas will increase that height to 120 m ( 393.70 ft ) . Two other buildings were constructed around the Nieuw Galgenwaard stadium ( 2007 ) . These buildings , the 'Kantoortoren Galghenwert ' and 'Apollo Residence ' , stand 85.5 and 64.5 metres high respectively .
Northwestern 's Evanston campus , where the undergraduate schools , the Graduate School , and the Kellogg School of Management are located , runs north-south from Lincoln Avenue to Clark Street west of Lake Michigan along Sheridan Road . North and South Campuses have noticeably different atmospheres , owing to the predominance of Science and Athletics in the one and Humanities and Arts in the other . North Campus is home to the fraternity quads , the Henry Crown Sports Pavilion and Norris Aquatics Center and other athletic facilities , the Technological Institute , Dearborn Observatory , and other science-related buildings including Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Hall for Nanofabrication and Molecular Self-Assembly , and the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center . South Campus is home to the University 's humanities buildings , Pick-Staiger Concert Hall and other music buildings , the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art , and the sorority quads . In the 1960s , the University created an additional 84 acres ( 34.0 ha ) by means of a lakefill in Lake Michigan . Among some of the buildings located on these broad new acres are University Library , Norris University Center ( the student union ) , and Pick-Staiger Concert Hall .
Napoleon 's triumph at Marengo secured his political authority and boosted his popularity back home , but it did not lead to an immediate peace . Bonaparte 's brother , Joseph , led the complex negotiations in Lunéville and reported that Austria , emboldened by British support , would not acknowledge the new territory that France had acquired . As negotiations became increasingly fractious , Bonaparte gave orders to his general Moreau to strike Austria once more . Moreau and the French swept through Bavaria and scored an overwhelming victory at Hohenlinden in December 1800 . As a result , the Austrians capitulated and signed the Treaty of Lunéville in February 1801 . The treaty reaffirmed and expanded earlier French gains at Campo Formio . Britain now remained the only nation that was still at war with France .
The quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns was a literary and artistic quarrel that heated up in the early 1690s and shook the Académie française . The opposing two sides were , the Ancients ( Anciens ) who constrain choice of subjects to those drawn from the literature of Antiquity and the Moderns ( Modernes ) , who supported the merits of the authors of the century of Louis XIV . Fontenelle quickly followed with his Digression sur les anciens et les modernes ( 1688 ) , in which he took the Modern side , pressing the argument that modern scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge .
Phillip Bard contributed to the theory with his work on animals . Bard found that sensory , motor , and physiological information all had to pass through the diencephalon ( particularly the thalamus ) , before being subjected to any further processing . Therefore , Cannon also argued that it was not anatomically possible for sensory events to trigger a physiological response prior to triggering conscious awareness and emotional stimuli had to trigger both physiological and experiential aspects of emotion simultaneously .
Turner Classic Movies also airs regularly scheduled weekly film blocks , which are periodically preempted for special themed month-long or seasonal scheduling events , such as the " 31 Days of Oscar " film series in the month preceding the Academy Awards and the month-long " Summer Under the Stars " in August ; all featured programming has their own distinctive feature presentation bumper for the particular scheduled presentation . The Essentials , currently hosted by Osborne and Sally Field as of 2015 [ update ] , is a weekly film showcase airing on Saturday evenings ( with a replay on the following Sunday at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time ) , which spotlights a different movie and contains a special introduction and post-movie discussion .
While the Philippines is generally considered a civil law nation , its Supreme Court is heavily modelled after the American Supreme Court . This can be attributed to the fact that the Philippines was colonized by both Spain and the United States , and the system of laws of both nations strongly influenced the development of Philippine laws and jurisprudence . Even as the body of Philippine laws remain mostly codified , the Philippine Civil Code expressly recognizes that decisions of the Supreme Court " form part of the law of the land " , belonging to the same class as statutes . The 1987 Philippine Constitution also explicitly grants to the Supreme Court the power of judicial review over laws and executive actions . The Supreme Court is composed of 1 Chief Justice and 14 Associate Justices . The court sits either en banc or in divisions , depending on the nature of the case to be decided .
Insects ( from Latin insectum , a calque of Greek ἔντομον [ éntomon ] , " cut into sections " ) are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton , a three-part body ( head , thorax and abdomen ) , three pairs of jointed legs , compound eyes and one pair of antennae . They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet , including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms . The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million , and potentially represent over 90 % of the differing animal life forms on Earth . Insects may be found in nearly all environments , although only a small number of species reside in the oceans , a habitat dominated by another arthropod group , crustaceans .
The name of local time typically changes when DST is observed . American English replaces standard with daylight : for example , Pacific Standard Time ( PST ) becomes Pacific Daylight Time ( PDT ) . In the United Kingdom , the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is British Summer Time ( BST ) , and British English typically inserts summer into other time zone names , e.g . Central European Time ( CET ) becomes Central European Summer Time ( CEST ) .
From 1950 to 2011 , world population increased from 2.5 billion to 7 billion and is forecast to reach a plateau of more than 9 billion during the 21st century . Sir David King , former chief scientific adviser to the UK government , told a parliamentary inquiry : " It is self-evident that the massive growth in the human population through the 20th century has had more impact on biodiversity than any other single factor . " At least until the middle of the 21st century , worldwide losses of pristine biodiverse land will probably depend much on the worldwide human birth rate .
The Soviet Union duplicated its dual-launch feat with Vostok 5 and Vostok 6 ( June 16 , 1963 ) . This time they launched the first woman ( also the first civilian ) , Valentina Tereshkova , into space on Vostok 6 . Launching a woman was reportedly Korolev 's idea , and it was accomplished purely for propaganda value . Tereshkova was one of a small corps of female cosmonauts who were amateur parachutists , but Tereshkova was the only one to fly . The USSR did n't again open its cosmonaut corps to women until 1980 , two years after the United States opened its astronaut corps to women .
The first truth explains the nature of dukkha . Dukkha is commonly translated as " suffering " , " anxiety " , " unsatisfactoriness " , " unease " , etc. , and it is said to have the following three aspects :
The ancient-Chamorro society had four classes : chamorri ( chiefs ) , matua ( upper class ) , achaot ( middle class ) , and mana'chang ( lower class ) . :20–21 The matua were located in the coastal villages , which meant they had the best access to fishing grounds , whereas the mana'chang were located in the interior of the island . Matua and mana'chang rarely communicated with each other , and matua often used achaot as intermediaries . There were also " makåhna " ( similar to shamans ) , skilled in healing and medicine . Belief in spirits of ancient Chamorros called " Taotao mo'na " still persists as a remnant of pre-European culture . Their society was organized along matrilineal clans . :21
Other states with long histories of no death penalty include Wisconsin ( the only state with only one execution ) , Rhode Island ( although later reintroduced , it was unused and abolished again ) , Maine , North Dakota , Minnesota , West Virginia , Iowa , and Vermont . The District of Columbia has also abolished the death penalty ; it was last used in 1957 . Oregon abolished the death penalty through an overwhelming majority in a 1964 public referendum but reinstated it in a 1984 joint death penalty/life imprisonment referendum by an even higher margin after a similar 1978 referendum succeeded but was not implemented due to judicial rulings .
Macao : The event was held in Macau on May 3 . It was the first time that the Olympic torch had traveled to Macau . A ceremony was held at Macau Fisherman 's Wharf . Afterward , the torch traveled through Macau , passing by a number of landmarks including A-Ma Temple , Macau Tower , Ponte Governador Nobre de Carvalho , Ponte de Sai Van , Macau Cultural Centre , Macau Stadium and then back to the Fisherman 's Wharf for the closing ceremony . Parts of the route near Ruins of St. Paul 's and Taipa was shortened due to large crowds of supporters blocking narrow streets . A total of 120 torchbearers participated in this event including casino tycoon Stanley Ho . Leong Hong Man and Leong Heng Teng were the first and last torchbearer in the relay respectively . An article published on Macao Daily News criticized that the list of the torchbearers could not fully represent the Macanese and that there were too many non-athletes among the torchbearers . ( some of whom had already been torchbearers of other sporting events )
German beacons operated on the medium-frequency band and the signals involved a two-letter Morse identifier followed by a lengthy time-lapse which enabled the Luftwaffe crews to determine the signal 's bearing . The Meacon system involved separate locations for a receiver with a directional aerial and a transmitter . The receipt of the German signal by the receiver was duly passed to the transmitter , the signal to be repeated . The action did not guarantee automatic success . If the German bomber flew closer to its own beam than the Meacon then the former signal would come through the stronger on the direction finder . The reverse would apply only if the meacon were closer .
The New York City Public Schools system , managed by the New York City Department of Education , is the largest public school system in the United States , serving about 1.1 million students in more than 1,700 separate primary and secondary schools . The city 's public school system includes nine specialized high schools to serve academically and artistically gifted students .
Temperatures in Israel vary widely , especially during the winter . Coastal areas , such as those of Tel Aviv and Haifa , have a typical Mediterranean climate with cool , rainy winters and long , hot summers . The area of Beersheba and the Northern Negev has a semi-arid climate with hot summers , cool winters and fewer rainy days than the Mediterranean climate . The Southern Negev and the Arava areas have desert climate with very hot and dry summers , and mild winters with few days of rain . The highest temperature in the continent of Asia ( 54.0 °C or 129.2 °F ) was recorded in 1942 at Tirat Zvi kibbutz in the northern Jordan river valley .
In January 1964 , Nasser called for an Arab League summit in Cairo to establish a unified Arab response against Israel 's plans to divert the Jordan River 's waters for economic purposes , which Syria and Jordan deemed an act of war . Nasser blamed Arab divisions for what he deemed " the disastrous situation " . He discouraged Syria and Palestinian guerrillas from provoking the Israelis , conceding that he had no plans for war with Israel . During the summit , Nasser developed cordial relations with King Hussein , and ties were mended with the rulers of Saudi Arabia , Syria , and Morocco . In May , Nasser moved to formally share his leadership position over the Palestine issue by initiating the creation of the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) . In practice , Nasser used the PLO to wield control over the Palestinian fedayeen . Its head was to be Ahmad Shukeiri , Nasser 's personal nominee .
At the end of the first decade of the 21st century , downtown Tucson underwent a revitalization effort by city planners and the business community . The primary project was Rio Nuevo , a large retail and community center that has been stalled in planning for more than ten years . Downtown is generally regarded as the area bordered by 17th Street to the south , I-10 to the west , and 6th Street to the north , and Toole Avenue and the Union Pacific ( formerly Southern Pacific ) railroad tracks , site of the historic train depot and " Locomotive # 1673 " , built in 1900 . Downtown is divided into the Presidio District , the Barrio Viejo , and the Congress Street Arts and Entertainment District . Some authorities include the 4th Avenue shopping district , which is set just northeast of the rest of downtown and connected by an underpass beneath the UPRR tracks .
The Manhattanville Bus Depot ( formerly known as the 132nd Street Bus Depot ) is located on West 132nd and 133rd Street between Broadway and Riverside Drive in the Manhattanville neighborhood .
Although research has been inconclusive , some findings have indicated that electronic communication negatively affects adolescents ' social development , replaces face-to-face communication , impairs their social skills , and can sometimes lead to unsafe interaction with strangers . A 2015 review reported that “adolescents lack awareness of strategies to cope with cyberbullying , which has been consistently associated with an increased likelihood of depression.” Studies have shown differences in the ways the internet negatively impacts the adolescents ' social functioning . Online socializing tends to make girls particularly vulnerable , while socializing in Internet cafés seems only to affect boys academic achievement . However , other research suggests that Internet communication brings friends closer and is beneficial for socially anxious teens , who find it easier to interact socially online . The more conclusive finding has been that Internet use has a negative effect on the physical health of adolescents , as time spent using the Internet replaces time doing physical activities . However , the Internet can be significantly useful in educating teens because of the access they have to information on many various topics .
While medieval pageants and festivals such as Corpus Christi were church-sanctioned , Carnival was also a manifestation of medieval folk culture . Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals , such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian–Alemannic Fastnacht . However , evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals . No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive and the shared features of feasting , role reversals , temporary social equality , masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals . These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions . For example , Easter begins with the resurrection of Jesus , followed by a liminal period and ends with rebirth . Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life , a liminal period follows before his death . Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar . Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures who make a gift to the people with their deaths . In the case of Jesus , the gift is eternal life in heaven and in the case of King Carnival , the acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life . Besides Christian anti-Judaism , the commonalities between church and Carnival rituals and imagery suggest a common root . Christ 's passion is itself grotesque : Since early Christianity Christ is figured as the victim of summary judgement , is tortured and executed by Romans before a Jewish mob ( " His blood is on us and on our children ! " Matthew 27:24–25 ) . Holy Week processions in Spain include crowds who vociferously insult the figure of Jesus . Irreverence , parody , degradation and laughter at a tragicomic effigy God can be seen as intensifications of the sacred order . In 1466 , the Catholic Church under Pope Paul II revieved customs of the Saturnalia carnival : Jews were forced to race naked through the streets of the city of Rome . “Before they were to run , the Jews were richly fed , so as to make the race more difficult for them and at the same time more amusing for spectators . They ran… amid Rome’s taunting shrieks and peals of laughter , while the Holy Father stood upon a richly ornamented balcony and laughed heartily” , an eyewitness reports .
Possibly the first venture into fictional treatments of Chopin 's life was a fanciful operatic version of some of its events . Chopin was written by Giacomo Orefice and produced in Milan in 1901 . All the music is derived from that of Chopin .
In early 2001 , Apple began shipping computers with CD-RW drives and emphasized the Mac 's ability to play DVDs by including DVD-ROM and DVD-RAM drives as standard . Steve Jobs admitted that Apple had been " late to the party " on writable CD technology , but felt that Macs could become a " digital hub " that linked and enabled an " emerging digital lifestyle " . Apple would later introduce an update to its iTunes music player software that enabled it to burn CDs , along with a controversial " Rip , Mix , Burn " advertising campaign that some felt encouraged media piracy . This accompanied the release of the iPod , Apple 's first successful handheld device . Apple continued to launch products , such as the unsuccessful Power Mac G4 Cube , the education-oriented eMac , and the titanium ( and later aluminium ) PowerBook G4 laptop for professionals .
In the UK , the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency approves drugs for use , though the evaluation is done by the European Medicines Agency , an agency of the European Union based in London . Normally an approval in the UK and other European countries comes later than one in the USA . Then it is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) , for England and Wales , who decides if and how the National Health Service ( NHS ) will allow ( in the sense of paying for ) their use . The British National Formulary is the core guide for pharmacists and clinicians .
Most animals indirectly use the energy of sunlight by eating plants or plant-eating animals . Most plants use light to convert inorganic molecules in their environment into carbohydrates , fats , proteins and other biomolecules , characteristically containing reduced carbon in the form of carbon-hydrogen bonds . Starting with carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and water ( H2O ) , photosynthesis converts the energy of sunlight into chemical energy in the form of simple sugars ( e.g. , glucose ) , with the release of molecular oxygen . These sugars are then used as the building blocks for plant growth , including the production of other biomolecules . When an animal eats plants ( or eats other animals which have eaten plants ) , the reduced carbon compounds in the food become a source of energy and building materials for the animal . They are either used directly to help the animal grow , or broken down , releasing stored solar energy , and giving the animal the energy required for motion .
When the U.S. entered World War II on December 8 , 1941 , many Montanans already had enlisted in the military to escape the poor national economy of the previous decade . Another 40,000-plus Montanans entered the armed forces in the first year following the declaration of war , and over 57,000 joined up before the war ended . These numbers constituted about 10 percent of the state 's total population , and Montana again contributed one of the highest numbers of soldiers per capita of any state . Many Native Americans were among those who served , including soldiers from the Crow Nation who became Code Talkers . At least 1500 Montanans died in the war . Montana also was the training ground for the First Special Service Force or " Devil 's Brigade , " a joint U.S-Canadian commando-style force that trained at Fort William Henry Harrison for experience in mountainous and winter conditions before deployment . Air bases were built in Great Falls , Lewistown , Cut Bank and Glasgow , some of which were used as staging areas to prepare planes to be sent to allied forces in the Soviet Union . During the war , about 30 Japanese balloon bombs were documented to have landed in Montana , though no casualties nor major forest fires were attributed to them .
The IJM used the grant money to found " Project Lantern " and established an office in the Philippines city of Cebu . In 2010 the results of the project were published , in which the IJM stated that Project Lantern had led to " an increase in law enforcement activity in sex trafficking cases , an increase in commitment to resolving sex trafficking cases among law enforcement officers trained through the project , and an increase in services – like shelter , counseling and career training – provided to trafficking survivors " . At the time that the results were released , the IJM was exploring opportunities to replicate the model in other regions .
The Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation began on 9 August 1945 , with the Soviet invasion of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo and was the last campaign of the Second World War and the largest of the 1945 Soviet–Japanese War which resumed hostilities between the Soviet Union and the Empire of Japan after almost six years of peace . Soviet gains on the continent were Manchukuo , Mengjiang ( Inner Mongolia ) and northern Korea . The rapid defeat of Japan 's Kwantung Army has been argued to be a significant factor in the Japanese surrender and the end of World War II , as Japan realized the Soviets were willing and able to take the cost of invasion of its Home Islands , after their rapid conquest of Manchuria and Invasion of South Sakhalin island .
Some countries were not included for various reasons , mainly the unavailability of certain crucial data . The following United Nations Member States were not included in the 2010 report . Cuba lodged a formal protest at its lack of inclusion . The UNDP explained that Cuba had been excluded due to the lack of an " internationally reported figure for Cuba’s Gross National Income adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity " . All other indicators for Cuba were available , and reported by the UNDP , but the lack of one indicator meant that no ranking could be attributed to the country . The situation has been addressed and , in later years , Cuba has ranked as a High Human Development country .
The bureau 's first official task was visiting and making surveys of the houses of prostitution in preparation for enforcing the " White Slave Traffic Act , " or Mann Act , passed on June 25 , 1910 . In 1932 , it was renamed the United States Bureau of Investigation . The following year it was linked to the Bureau of Prohibition and rechristened the Division of Investigation ( DOI ) before finally becoming an independent service within the Department of Justice in 1935 . In the same year , its name was officially changed from the Division of Investigation to the present-day Federal Bureau of Investigation , or FBI .
The term " post-punk " was first used by journalists in the late 1970s to describe groups moving beyond punk 's sonic template into disparate areas . Many of these artists , initially inspired by punk 's DIY ethic and energy , ultimately became disillusioned with the style and movement , feeling that it had fallen into commercial formula , rock convention and self-parody . They repudiated its populist claims to accessibility and raw simplicity , instead seeing an opportunity to break with musical tradition , subvert commonplaces and challenge audiences . Artists moved beyonds punk 's focus on the concerns of a largely white , male , working class population and abandoned its continued reliance on established rock and roll tropes , such as three-chord progressions and Chuck Berry-based guitar riffs . These artists instead defined punk as " an imperative to constant change " , believing that " radical content demands radical form " .
Auto racing is also popular in the area . The Richmond International Raceway ( RIR ) has hosted NASCAR Sprint Cup races since 1953 , as well as the Capital City 400 from 1962 − 1980 . RIR also hosted IndyCar 's Suntrust Indy Challenge from 2001 − 2009 . Another track , Southside Speedway , has operated since 1959 and sits just southwest of Richmond in Chesterfield County . This .333-mile ( 0.536 km ) oval short-track has become known as the " Toughest Track in the South " and " The Action Track " , and features weekly stock car racing on Friday nights . Southside Speedway has acted as the breeding grounds for many past NASCAR legends including Richard Petty , Bobby Allison and Darrell Waltrip , and claims to be the home track of NASCAR superstar Denny Hamlin .
Every dollar ( $ 1 ) that is spent on pesticides for crops yields four dollars ( $ 4 ) in crops saved . This means based that , on the amount of money spent per year on pesticides , $ 10 billion , there is an additional $ 40 billion savings in crop that would be lost due to damage by insects and weeds . In general , farmers benefit from having an increase in crop yield and from being able to grow a variety of crops throughout the year . Consumers of agricultural products also benefit from being able to afford the vast quantities of produce available year-round . The general public also benefits from the use of pesticides for the control of insect-borne diseases and illnesses , such as malaria . The use of pesticides creates a large job market within the agrichemical sector .
In most bacteria , a cell wall is present on the outside of the cell membrane . The cell membrane and cell wall comprise the cell envelope . A common bacterial cell wall material is peptidoglycan ( called " murein " in older sources ) , which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by peptides containing D-amino acids . Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi , which are made of cellulose and chitin , respectively . The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea , which do not contain peptidoglycan . The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria , and the antibiotic penicillin is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan .
Throughout the 20th century , most Bissau-Guineans practiced some form of Animism . In the early 21st century , many have adopted Islam , which is now practiced by 50 % of the country 's population . Most of Guinea-Bissau 's Muslims are of the Sunni denomination with approximately 2 % belonging to the Ahmadiyya sect .
Following the assassination of Phillip II , his son Alexander III ( " The Great " ) assumed the leadership of the League of Corinth and launched an invasion of the Persian Empire with the combined forces of all Greek states in 334 BC . Undefeated in battle , Alexander had conquered the Persian Empire in its entirety by 330 BC . By the time of his death in 323 BC , he had created one of the largest empires in history , stretching from Greece to India . His empire split into several kingdoms upon his death , the most famous of which were the Seleucid Empire , Ptolemaic Egypt , the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom . Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria , Antioch , Seleucia and the many other new Hellenistic cities in Asia and Africa . Although the political unity of Alexander 's empire could not be maintained , it resulted in the Hellenistic civilization and spread the Greek language and Greek culture in the territories conquered by Alexander . Greek science , technology and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period .
Israel was established as a homeland for the Jewish people and is often referred to as a Jewish state . The country 's Law of Return grants all Jews and those of Jewish ancestry the right to Israeli citizenship . Over three quarters , or 75.5 % , of the population are Jews from a diversity of Jewish backgrounds . Around 4 % of Israelis ( 300,000 ) , ethnically defined as " others " , are Russian descendants of Jewish origin or family who are not Jewish according to rabbinical law , but were eligible for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return . Approximately 75 % of Israeli Jews are born in Israel , 17 % are immigrants from Europe and the Americas , and 8 % are immigrants from Asia and Africa ( including the Arab World ) . Jews from Europe and the former Soviet Union and their descendants born in Israel , including Ashkenazi Jews , constitute approximately 50 % of Jewish Israelis . Jews who left or fled Arab and Muslim countries and their descendants , including both Mizrahi and Sephardi Jews , form most of the rest of the Jewish population . Jewish intermarriage rates run at over 35 % and recent studies suggest that the percentage of Israelis descended from both Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews increases by 0.5 percent every year , with over 25 % of school children now originating from both communities .
The United States No Electronic Theft Act ( NET Act ) , a federal law passed in 1997 , in response to LaMacchia , provides for criminal prosecution of individuals who engage in copyright infringement under certain circumstances , even when there is no monetary profit or commercial benefit from the infringement . Maximum penalties can be five years in prison and up to $ 250,000 in fines . The NET Act also raised statutory damages by 50 % . The court 's ruling explicitly drew attention to the shortcomings of current law that allowed people to facilitate mass copyright infringement while being immune to prosecution under the Copyright Act .
One of the major developments in the military sphere during the Late Middle Ages was the increased use of infantry and light cavalry . The English also employed longbowmen , but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success . Armour continued to advance , spurred by the increasing power of crossbows , and plate armour was developed to protect soldiers from crossbows as well as the hand-held guns that were developed . Pole arms reached new prominence with the development of the Flemish and Swiss infantry armed with pikes and other long spears .
Aristotle however suggested that swallows and other birds hibernated . This belief persisted as late as 1878 , when Elliott Coues listed the titles of no less than 182 papers dealing with the hibernation of swallows . Even the " highly observant " Gilbert White , in his posthumously published 1789 The Natural History of Selborne , quoted a man 's story about swallows being found in a chalk cliff collapse " while he was a schoolboy at Brighthelmstone " , though the man denied being an eyewitness . However , he also writes that " as to swallows being found in a torpid state during the winter in the Isle of Wight or any part of this country , I never heard any such account worth attending to " , and that if early swallows " happen to find frost and snow they immediately withdraw for a time—a circumstance this much more in favour of hiding than migration " , since he doubts they would " return for a week or two to warmer latitudes " .
During George 's reign the break-up of the British Empire and its transition into the Commonwealth of Nations accelerated . The parliament of the Irish Free State removed direct mention of the monarch from the country 's constitution on the day of his accession . From 1939 , the Empire and Commonwealth , except Ireland , was at war with Nazi Germany . War with Italy and Japan followed in 1940 and 1941 , respectively . Though Britain and its allies were ultimately victorious in 1945 , the United States and the Soviet Union rose as pre-eminent world powers and the British Empire declined . After the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947 , George remained as king of both countries , but the title Emperor of India was abandoned in June 1948 . Ireland formally declared itself a republic and left the Commonwealth in 1949 , and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year . George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth . He was beset by health problems in the later years of his reign . His elder daughter , Elizabeth , succeeded him .
The most important source after Polybius is Diodorus Siculus who wrote his Bibliotheca historica between 60 and 30 BCE and reproduced some important earlier sources such as Hieronymus , but his account of the Hellenistic period breaks off after the battle of Ipsus ( 301 ) . Another important source , Plutarch 's ( c.50—c.120 ) Parallel Lives though more preoccupied with issues of personal character and morality , outlines the history of important Hellenistic figures . Appian of Alexandria ( late first century CE-before 165 CE ) wrote a history of the Roman empire that includes information of some Hellenistic kingdoms .
An important part of traditional , pre-generative schools of phonology is studying which sounds can be grouped into distinctive units within a language ; these units are known as phonemes . For example , in English , the " p " sound in pot is aspirated ( pronounced [ pʰ ] ) while that in spot is not aspirated ( pronounced [ p ] ) . However , English speakers intuitively treat both sounds as variations ( allophones ) of the same phonological category , that is of the phoneme /p/ . ( Traditionally , it would be argued that if an aspirated [ pʰ ] were interchanged with the unaspirated [ p ] in spot , native speakers of English would still hear the same words ; that is , the two sounds are perceived as " the same " /p/ . ) In some other languages , however , these two sounds are perceived as different , and they are consequently assigned to different phonemes . For example , in Thai , Hindi , and Quechua , there are minimal pairs of words for which aspiration is the only contrasting feature ( two words can have different meanings but with the only difference in pronunciation being that one has an aspirated sound where the other has an unaspirated one ) .
In 2006 , Lee was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Notre Dame . During the ceremony , the students and audience gave Lee a standing ovation , and the entire graduating class held up copies of To Kill a Mockingbird to honor her . [ note 5 ] Lee was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 5 , 2007 by President George W. Bush . In his remarks , Bush stated , " One reason To Kill a Mockingbird succeeded is the wise and kind heart of the author , which comes through on every page ... To Kill a Mockingbird has influenced the character of our country for the better . It 's been a gift to the entire world . As a model of good writing and humane sensibility , this book will be read and studied forever . "
At birth , Victoria was fifth in the line of succession after her father and his three older brothers : the Prince Regent , the Duke of York , and the Duke of Clarence ( later William IV ) . The Prince Regent and the Duke of York were estranged from their wives , who were both past child-bearing age , so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children . The Dukes of Kent and Clarence married on the same day 12 months before Victoria 's birth , but both of Clarence 's daughters ( born in 1819 and 1820 respectively ) died as infants . Victoria 's grandfather and father died in 1820 , within a week of each other , and the Duke of York died in 1827 . On the death of her uncle George IV in 1830 , Victoria became heiress presumptive to her next surviving uncle , William IV . The Regency Act 1830 made special provision for the Duchess of Kent to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor . King William distrusted the Duchess 's capacity to be regent , and in 1836 declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria 's 18th birthday , so that a regency could be avoided .
The MPEG-1 standard does not include a precise specification for an MP3 encoder , but does provide example psychoacoustic models , rate loop , and the like in the non-normative part of the original standard . At present , these suggested implementations are quite dated . Implementers of the standard were supposed to devise their own algorithms suitable for removing parts of the information from the audio input . As a result , there are many different MP3 encoders available , each producing files of differing quality . Comparisons are widely available , so it is easy for a prospective user of an encoder to research the best choice . An encoder that is proficient at encoding at higher bit rates ( such as LAME ) is not necessarily as good at lower bit rates .
An Ancient Chinese document from the 9th century referred to the northern Somali coast — which was then called " Berbera " by Arab geographers in reference to the region 's " Berber " ( Cushitic ) inhabitants — as Po-pa-li . The first clear written reference of the sobriquet Somali , however , dates back to the 15th century . During the wars between the Sultanate of Ifat based at Zeila and the Solomonic Dynasty , the Abyssinian Emperor had one of his court officials compose a hymn celebrating a military victory over the Sultan of Ifat 's eponymous troops .
In 1636 George , Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg , ruler of the Brunswick-Lüneburg principality of Calenberg , moved his residence to Hanover . The Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692 , and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708 . Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg , colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg 's capital ( see also : House of Hanover ) . Its electors would later become monarchs of Great Britain ( and from 1801 , of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ) . The first of these was George I Louis , who acceded to the British throne in 1714 . The last British monarch who ruled in Hanover was William IV . Semi-Salic law , which required succession by the male line if possible , forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover . As a male-line descendant of George I , Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover . Her descendants , however , bore her husband 's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha . Three kings of Great Britain , or the United Kingdom , were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover .
Scholar Patrick Chura , who suggests Emmett Till was a model for Tom Robinson , enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional Tom that Till also faced . Chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to the representation of the " mythologized vulnerable and sacred Southern womanhood " . Any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused . Tom Robinson 's trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence , as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury 's decision . Furthermore , the victim of racial injustice in To Kill a Mockingbird was physically impaired , which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of , but also crippled him in other ways . Roslyn Siegel includes Tom Robinson as an example of the recurring motif among white Southern writers of the black man as " stupid , pathetic , defenseless , and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites , rather than his own intelligence to save him " . Although Tom is spared from being lynched , he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison , shot seventeen times .
The World Bank has sponsored a project to curb air pollution through public transport improvements and the Mexican government has started shutting down polluting factories . They have phased out diesel buses and mandated new emission controls on new cars ; since 1993 all new cars must be fitted with a catalytic converter , which reduces the emissions released . Trucks must use only liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) . Also construction of an underground rail system was begun in 1968 in order to help curb air pollution problems and alleviate traffic congestion . Today it has over 201 km ( 125 mi ) of track and carries over 5 million people every day . Fees are kept low to encourage use of the system and during rush hours the crush is so great , that authorities have reserved a special carriage specifically for women . Due to these initiatives and others , the air quality in Mexico City has begun to improve , with the air becoming cleaner since 1991 , when the air quality was declared to be a public health risk for 355 days of the year .

The Franco-Prussian War was a conflict between France and Prussia , while Prussia was backed up by the North German Confederation , of which it was a member , and the South German states of Baden , Württemberg and Bavaria . The complete Prussian and German victory brought about the final unification of Germany under King Wilhelm I of Prussia . It also marked the downfall of Napoleon III and the end of the Second French Empire , which was replaced by the Third Republic . As part of the settlement , almost all of the territory of Alsace-Lorraine was taken by Prussia to become a part of Germany , which it would retain until the end of World War I .
Universal Music Group decided not to renew their contract with the iTunes Store on July 3 , 2007 . Universal will now supply iTunes in an 'at will ' capacity .
Himachal Pradesh is famous for its abundant natural beauty . After the war between Nepal and Britain , also known as the Anglo-Gorkha War ( 1814–1816 ) , the British colonial government came into power and the land now comprising Himachal Pradesh became part of the Punjab Province of British India . In 1950 , Himachal was declared a union territory , but after the State of Himachal Pradesh Act 1971 , Himachal emerged as the 18th state of the Republic of India . Hima means snow in Sanskrit , and the literal meaning of the state 's name is " In the lap of Himalayas " . It was named by Acharya Diwakar Datt Sharma , one of the great Sanskrit scholars of Himachal Pradesh .
Whitehead did not begin his career as a philosopher . In fact , he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education . Early in his life he showed great interest in and respect for philosophy and metaphysics , but it is evident that he considered himself a rank amateur . In one letter to his friend and former student Bertrand Russell , after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive , he wrote : " This further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic , onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter . " Ironically , in later life Whitehead would become one of the 20th century 's foremost metaphysicians .
Corey Clark was disqualified during the finals for having an undisclosed police record ; however , he later alleged that he and Paula Abdul had an affair while on the show and that this contributed to his expulsion . Clark also claimed that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show due to their affair . The allegations were dismissed by Fox after an independent investigation . Two semi-finalists were also disqualified that year – Jaered Andrews for an arrest on an assault charge , and Frenchie Davis for having previously modelled for an adult website .
Improved aircraft designs were in the offing with the Bristol Beaufighter , then under development . It would prove formidable , but its development was slow . The Beaufighter had a maximum speed of 320 mph ( 510 km/h ) , an operational ceiling of 26,000 ft ( 7,900 m ) and a climb rate of 2,500 ft ( 760 m ) per minute . Its armament of four 20 mm ( 0.79 in ) Hispano cannon and six .303 in Browning machine guns offered a serious threat to German bombers . On 19 November , John Cunningham of No . 604 Squadron RAF shot down a bomber flying an AI-equipped Beaufighter . It was the first air victory for the airborne radar .
Chopin 's music remains very popular and is regularly performed , recorded and broadcast worldwide . The world 's oldest monographic music competition , the International Chopin Piano Competition , founded in 1927 , is held every five years in Warsaw . The Fryderyk Chopin Institute of Poland lists on its website over eighty societies world-wide devoted to the composer and his music . The Institute site also lists nearly 1,500 performances of Chopin works on YouTube as of January 2014 .
Laird writes that Altan Khan abolished the native Mongol practices of shamanism and blood sacrifice , while the Mongol princes and subjects were coerced by Altan to convert to Gelug Buddhism—or face execution if they persisted in their shamanistic ways . Committed to their religious leader , Mongol princes began requesting the Dalai Lama to bestow titles on them , which demonstrated " the unique fusion of religious and political power " wielded by the Dalai Lama , as Laird writes . Kolmaš states that the spiritual and secular Mongol-Tibetan alliance of the 13th century was renewed by this alliance constructed by Altan Khan and Sönam Gyatso . Van Praag writes that this restored the original Mongol patronage of a Tibetan lama and " to this day , Mongolians are among the most devout followers of the Gelugpa and the Dalai Lama . " Angela F. Howard writes that this unique relationship not only provided the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama with religious and political authority in Tibet , but that Altan Khan gained " enormous power among the entire Mongol population . "
The rebel barons responded by inviting the French prince Louis to lead them : Louis had a claim to the English throne by virtue of his marriage to Blanche of Castile , a granddaughter of Henry II . Philip may have provided him with private support but refused to openly support Louis , who was excommunicated by Innocent for taking part in the war against John . Louis ' planned arrival in England presented a significant problem for John , as the prince would bring with him naval vessels and siege engines essential to the rebel cause . Once John contained Alexander in Scotland , he marched south to deal with the challenge of the coming invasion .
Buddhists do not consider Siddhartha Gautama to have been the only Buddha . The Pali Canon refers to many previous ones ( see List of the 28 Buddhas ) , while the Mahayana tradition additionally has many Buddhas of celestial , rather than historical , origin ( see Amitabha or Vairocana as examples , for lists of many thousands Buddha names see Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō numbers 439–448 ) . A common Theravada and Mahayana Buddhist belief is that the next Buddha will be one named Maitreya ( Pali : Metteyya ) .
Relationships between religious groups are generally amicable , although there is some concern among mainstream Muslim leaders [ who ? ] that minority religious groups undermine national unity . There is a concern for religious institutions becoming active in the political sphere . The Islamic Renaissance Party ( IRP ) , a major combatant in the 1992–1997 Civil War and then-proponent of the creation of an Islamic state in Tajikistan , constitutes no more than 30 % of the government by statute . Membership in Hizb ut-Tahrir , a militant Islamic party which today aims for an overthrow of secular governments and the unification of Tajiks under one Islamic state , is illegal and members are subject to arrest and imprisonment . Numbers of large mosques appropriate for Friday prayers are limited and some [ who ? ] feel this is discriminatory .
The Díaz administration made political decisions and took legal measures that allowed the elite throughout Mexico to concentrate the nation 's wealth by favoring monopolies . During this time , two-fifths of the state 's territory was divided among 17 rich families which owned practically all of the arable land in Chihuahua . The state economy grew at a rapid pace during the Porfiriato ; the economy in Chihuahua was dominated by agriculture and mining . The Díaz administration helped Governor Luis Terrazas by funding the Municipal Public Library in Chihuahua City and passing a federal initiative for the construction of the railroad from Chihuahua City to Ciudad Júarez . By 1881 , the Central Mexican Railroad was completed which connected Mexico City to Ciudad Juárez . In 1883 telephone lines were installed throughout the state , allowing communication between Chihuahua City and Aldama . By 1888 the telephone services were extended from the capital to the cites of Julimes , Meoqui , and Hidalgo del Parral ; the telecommunication network in the state covered an estimated 3,500 kilometers . The need of laborers to construct the extensive infrastructure projects resulted in a significant Asian immigration , mostly from China . Asian immigrants soon become integral to the state economy by opening restaurants , small grocery stores , and hotels . By the end of the Terrazas term , the state experienced an increase in commerce , mining , and banking . When the banks were nationalized , Chihuahua became the most important banking state in Mexico .
A Federal Trade Commission report issued in 1958 attempted to quantify the effect of antibiotic development on American public health . The report found that over the period 1946-1955 , there was a 42 % drop in the incidence of diseases for which antibiotics were effective and only a 20 % drop in those for which antibiotics were not effective . The report concluded that " it appears that the use of antibiotics , early diagnosis , and other factors have limited the epidemic spread and thus the number of these diseases which have occurred " . The study further examined mortality rates for eight common diseases for which antibiotics offered effective therapy ( syphilis , tuberculosis , dysentery , scarlet fever , whooping cough , meningococcal infections , and pneumonia ) , and found a 56 % decline over the same period . Notable among these was a 75 % decline in deaths due to tuberculosis .
The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke ( prong , tooth ) . German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746 . Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800 . Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron ( hot-dip galvanizing ) is the major application for zinc . Other applications are in batteries , small non-structural castings , and alloys , such as brass . A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used , such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate ( as dietary supplements ) , zinc chloride ( in deodorants ) , zinc pyrithione ( anti-dandruff shampoos ) , zinc sulfide ( in luminescent paints ) , and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory .
Like in English , Dutch has generalised the dative over the accusative case for all pronouns , e.g . Du me , je , Eng me , you , vs. Germ mich/mir dich/dir . There is one exception : the standard language prescribes that in the third person plural , hen is to be used for the direct object , and hun for the indirect object . This distinction was artificially introduced in the 17th century by grammarians , and is largely ignored in spoken language and not well understood by Dutch speakers . Consequently , the third person plural forms hun and hen are interchangeable in normal usage , with hun being more common . The shared unstressed form ze is also often used as both direct and indirect objects and is a useful avoidance strategy when people are unsure which form to use .
In Methodism , Mary is honored as the Mother of God . Methodists do not have any additional teachings on the Virgin Mary except from what is mentioned in Scripture and the ecumenical Creeds . As such , Methodists believe that Mary was conceived in her womb through the Holy Ghost and accept the doctrine of the Virgin Birth , although they , along with Orthodox Christians and other Protestant Christians , reject the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception . John Wesley , the principal founder of the Methodist movement within the Church of England , believed that Mary " continued a pure and unspotted virgin " , thus upholding the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary . Contemporary Methodism does hold that Mary was a virgin before , during , and immediately after the birth of Christ . In addition , some Methodists also hold the doctrine of the Assumption of Mary as a pious opinion .
In Kazakhstan Russian is not a state language , but according to article 7 of the Constitution of Kazakhstan its usage enjoys equal status to that of the Kazakh language in state and local administration . According to estimates from Demoskop Weekly , in 2004 there were 4,200,000 native speakers of Russian in the country , and 10 million active speakers . 63 % of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006 , and 46 % used it as the main language with family , friends or at work . According to a 2001 estimate from the World Factbook , 95 % of the population can speak Russian . Large Russian-speaking communities still exist in northern Kazakhstan , and ethnic Russians comprise 25.6 % of Kazakhstan 's population . The 2009 census reported that 10,309,500 people , or 84.8 % of the population aged 15 and above , could read and write well in Russian , as well as understand the spoken language .
During the war , the Seven Nations of Canada were allied with the French . These were Native Americans of the Laurentian valley—the Algonquin , the Abenaki , the Huron , and others . Although the Algonquin tribes and the Seven Nations were not directly concerned with the fate of the Ohio River Valley , they had been victims of the Iroquois Confederation . The Iroquois had encroached on Algonquin territory and pushed the Algonquins west beyond Lake Michigan . Therefore , the Algonquin and the Seven Nations were interested in fighting against the Iroquois . Throughout New England , New York , and the North-west Native American tribes formed differing alliances with the major belligerents . The Iroquois , dominant in what is now Upstate New York , sided with the British but did not play a large role in the war .
DNA samples from 1228 Russians show that the Y chromosomes analyzed , all except 20 ( 1.6 % ) fall into seven major haplogroups all characteristic to West Eurasian populations . Taken together , they account for 95 % of the total Russian Y chromosomal pool . Only ( 0.7 % ) fell into haplogroups that are specific to East and South Asian populations . Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) examined in Poles and Russians revealed the presence of all major European haplogroups , which were characterized by similar patterns of distribution in Poles and Russians . An analysis of the DNA did not reveal any specific combinations of unique mtDNA haplotypes and their subclusters . The DNA clearly shows that both Poles and Russians are not different from the neighbouring European populations .
Norman plays host to the Norman Music Festival , a festival that highlights native Oklahoma bands and musicians . Norman is also host to the Medieval Fair of Norman , which has been held annually since 1976 and was Oklahoma 's first medieval fair . The Fair was held first on the south oval of the University of Oklahoma campus and in the third year moved to the Duck Pond in Norman until the Fair became too big and moved to Reaves Park in 2003 . The Medieval Fair of Norman is Oklahoma 's " largest weekend event and the third largest event in Oklahoma , and was selected by Events Media Network as one of the top 100 events in the nation " .
However , William Woodthorpe Tarn , between World War I and World War II and the heyday of the League of Nations , focused on the issues of racial and cultural confrontation and the nature of colonial rule . Michael Rostovtzeff , who fled the Russian Revolution , concentrated predominantly on the rise of the capitalist bourgeoisie in areas of Greek rule . Arnaldo Momigliano , an Italian Jew who wrote before and after the Second World War , studied the problem of mutual understanding between races in the conquered areas . Moses Hadas portrayed an optimistic picture of synthesis of culture from the perspective of the 1950s , while Frank William Walbank in the 1960s and 1970s had a materialistic approach to the Hellenistic period , focusing mainly on class relations . Recently , however , papyrologist C. Préaux has concentrated predominantly on the economic system , interactions between kings and cities and provides a generally pessimistic view on the period . Peter Green , on the other hand , writes from the point of view of late 20th century liberalism , his focus being on individualism , the breakdown of convention , experiments and a postmodern disillusionment with all institutions and political processes .
The Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India are geographically considered part of Southeast Asia . Eastern Bangladesh and the Seven Sister States of India are culturally part of Southeast Asia and sometimes considered both South Asian and Southeast Asian . The Seven Sister States of India are also geographically part of Southeast Asia .

Portugal 's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity , as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe , looking out into the Atlantic Ocean . It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories ( among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975 ) , turning over the administration of Macau to the People 's Republic of China at the end of 1999 . Consequently , it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies , resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons . Portugal , long a country of emigration ( the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry ) , has now become a country of net immigration , and not just from the last Indian ( Portuguese until 1961 ) , African ( Portuguese until 1975 ) , and Far East Asian ( Portuguese until 1999 ) overseas territories . An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country 's African possessions gained independence in 1975 . By 2007 , Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants of whom about 332,137 were legal immigrants .
The first scientific and literary journals were established during the Enlightenment . The first journal , the Parisian Journal des Sçavans , appeared in 1665 . However , it was not until 1682 that periodicals began to be more widely produced . French and Latin were the dominant languages of publication , but there was also a steady demand for material in German and Dutch . There was generally low demand for English publications on the Continent , which was echoed by England 's similar lack of desire for French works . Languages commanding less of an international market – such as Danish , Spanish and Portuguese – found journal success more difficult , and more often than not , a more international language was used instead . French slowly took over Latin 's status as the lingua franca of learned circles . This in turn gave precedence to the publishing industry in Holland , where the vast majority of these French language periodicals were produced .
London 's largest industry is finance , and its financial exports make it a large contributor to the UK 's balance of payments . Around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in London until mid-2007 . London has over 480 overseas banks , more than any other city in the world . Over 85 percent ( 3.2 million ) of the employed population of greater London works in the services industries . Because of its prominent global role , London 's economy had been affected by the Late-2000s financial crisis . However , by 2010 the City has recovered ; put in place new regulatory powers , proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established London 's economic dominance . The City of London is home to the Bank of England , London Stock Exchange , and Lloyd 's of London insurance market .
Agriculture and food and drink production continue to be major industries in the county , employing over 15,000 people . Apple orchards were once plentiful , and Somerset is still a major producer of cider . The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet are involved with the production of cider , especially Blackthorn Cider , which is sold nationwide , and there are specialist producers such as Burrow Hill Cider Farm and Thatchers Cider . Gerber Products Company in Bridgwater is the largest producer of fruit juices in Europe , producing brands such as " Sunny Delight " and " Ocean Spray . " Development of the milk-based industries , such as Ilchester Cheese Company and Yeo Valley Organic , have resulted in the production of ranges of desserts , yoghurts and cheeses , including Cheddar cheese—some of which has the West Country Farmhouse Cheddar Protected Designation of Origin ( PDO ) .
On 21 May , Amer asked Nasser to order the Straits of Tiran blockaded , a move Nasser believed Israel would use as a casus belli . Amer reassured him that the army was prepared for confrontation , but Nasser doubted Amer 's assessment of the military 's readiness . According to Nasser 's vice president Zakaria Mohieddin , although " Amer had absolute authority over the armed forces , Nasser had his ways of knowing what was really going on " . Moreover , Amer anticipated an impending Israeli attack and advocated a preemptive strike . Nasser refused the call upon determination that the air force lacked pilots and Amer 's handpicked officers were incompetent . Still , Nasser concluded that if Israel attacked , Egypt 's quantitative advantage in manpower and arms could stave off Israeli forces for at least two weeks , allowing for diplomacy towards a ceasefire . Towards the end of May , Nasser increasingly exchanged his positions of deterrence for deference to the inevitability of war , under increased pressure to act by both the general Arab populace and various Arab governments . On 26 May Nasser declared , " our basic objective will be to destroy Israel " . On 30 May , King Hussein committed Jordan in an alliance with Egypt and Syria .
Neptune has a number of known trojan objects occupying both the Sun–Neptune L4 and L5 Lagrangian points—gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing Neptune in its orbit , respectively . Neptune trojans can be viewed as being in a 1:1 resonance with Neptune . Some Neptune trojans are remarkably stable in their orbits , and are likely to have formed alongside Neptune rather than being captured . The first and so far only object identified as associated with Neptune 's trailing L5 Lagrangian point is 2008 LC18 . Neptune also has a temporary quasi-satellite , ( 309239 ) 2007 RW10 . The object has been a quasi-satellite of Neptune for about 12,500 years and it will remain in that dynamical state for another 12,500 years .
Birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions . While some birds are generalists , others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements . Even within a single habitat , such as a forest , the niches occupied by different species of birds vary , with some species feeding in the forest canopy , others beneath the canopy , and still others on the forest floor . Forest birds may be insectivores , frugivores , and nectarivores . Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing , plant eating , and piracy or kleptoparasitism . Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds , while vultures are specialised scavengers . Avivores are animals that are specialized at preying on birds .
In February 2012 , Capello resigned from his role as England manager , following a disagreement with the FA over their request to remove John Terry from team captaincy after accusations of racial abuse concerning the player . Following this , there was media speculation that Harry Redknapp would take the job . However , on 1 May 2012 , Roy Hodgson was announced as the new manager , just six weeks before UEFA Euro 2012 . England managed to finish top of their group , winning two and drawing one of their fixtures , but exited the Championships in the quarter-finals via a penalty shoot-out , this time to Italy .
Some large broad-winged birds rely on thermal columns of rising hot air to enable them to soar . These include many birds of prey such as vultures , eagles , and buzzards , but also storks . These birds migrate in the daytime . Migratory species in these groups have great difficulty crossing large bodies of water , since thermals only form over land , and these birds can not maintain active flight for long distances . Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds , which must cross at the narrowest points . Massive numbers of large raptors and storks pass through areas such as the Strait of Messina , Gibraltar , Falsterbo , and the Bosphorus at migration times . More common species , such as the European honey buzzard Pernis apivorus , can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn . Other barriers , such as mountain ranges , can also cause funnelling , particularly of large diurnal migrants . This is a notable factor in the Central American migratory bottleneck . Batumi bottleneck in the Caucasus is one of the heaviest migratory funnels on earth . Avoiding flying over the Black Sea surface and across high mountains , hundreds of thousands of soaring birds funnel through an area around the city of Batumi , Georgia . Birds of prey such as honey buzzards which migrate using thermals lose only 10 to 20 % of their weight during migration , which may explain why they forage less during migration than do smaller birds of prey with more active flight such as falcons , hawks and harriers .
Detroit is one of 12 American metropolitan areas that are home to professional teams representing the four major sports in North America . All these teams but one play within the city of Detroit itself ( the NBA 's Detroit Pistons play in suburban Auburn Hills at The Palace of Auburn Hills ) . There are three active major sports venues within the city : Comerica Park ( home of the Major League Baseball team Detroit Tigers ) , Ford Field ( home of the NFL 's Detroit Lions ) , and Joe Louis Arena ( home of the NHL 's Detroit Red Wings ) . A 1996 marketing campaign promoted the nickname " Hockeytown " .
The Anglo-French hostilities were ended in 1763 by the Treaty of Paris , which involved a complex series of land exchanges , the most important being France 's cession to Spain of Louisiana , and to Great Britain the rest of New France except for the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon . Faced with the choice of retrieving either New France or its Caribbean island colonies of Guadeloupe and Martinique , France chose the latter to retain these lucrative sources of sugar , writing off New France as an unproductive , costly territory . France also returned Minorca to the British . Spain lost control of Florida to Great Britain , but it received from the French the Île d'Orléans and all of the former French holdings west of the Mississippi River . The exchanges suited the British as well , as their own Caribbean islands already supplied ample sugar , and , with the acquisition of New France and Florida , they now controlled all of North America east of the Mississippi .
The most catastrophic earthquakes we know of occurred in 31 BCE , 363 , 749 , and 1033 CE , that is every ca . 400 years on average . Destructive earthquakes leading to serious loss of life strike about every 80 years . While stringent construction regulations are currently in place and recently built structures are earthquake-safe , as of 2007 [ update ] the majority of the buildings in Israel were older than these regulations and many public buildings as well as 50,000 residential buildings did not meet the new standards and were " expected to collapse " if exposed to a strong quake . Given the fragile political situation of the Middle East region and the presence there of major holy sites , a quake reaching magnitude 7 on the Richter scale could have dire consequences for world peace .
There are a variety of watersports in Cork , including rowing and sailing . There are five rowing clubs training on the river Lee , including Shandon BC , UCC RC , Pres RC , Lee RC , and Cork BC . Naomhóga Chorcaí is a rowing club whose members row traditional naomhóga on the Lee in occasional competitions . The " Ocean to City " race has been held annually since 2005 , and attracts teams and boats from local and visiting clubs who row the 24 kilometres ( 15 mi ) from Crosshaven into Cork city centre . The decision to move the National Rowing Center to Inniscarra has boosted numbers involved in the sport . [ citation needed ] Cork 's maritime sailing heritage is maintained through its sailing clubs . The Royal Cork Yacht Club located in Crosshaven ( outside the city ) is the world 's oldest yacht club , and " Cork Week " is a notable sailing event .

In September 2003 , a military coup was conducted . The military arrested Ialá on the charge of being " unable to solve the problems " . After being delayed several times , legislative elections were held in March 2004 . A mutiny of military factions in October 2004 resulted in the death of the head of the armed forces and caused widespread unrest .
As they grew older Madonna and her sisters would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began drifting farther from them . They would study pictures of her and come to think that she resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses . This would later raise Madonna 's interest in poetry , with Sylvia Plath being her favourite . Later , Madonna commented : " We were all wounded in one way or another by [ her death ] , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else . The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something . If I had n't had that emptiness , I would n't have been so driven . Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I 'm going to be really strong if I ca n't have my mother . I 'm going to take care of myself . " Taraborrelli felt that in time , no doubt because of the devastation she felt , Madonna would never again allow herself , or even her daughter , to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died . " Her death had taught [ Madonna ] a valuable lesson , that she would have to remain strong for herself because , she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle . "
A dialect is distinguished by its vocabulary , grammar , and pronunciation ( phonology , including prosody ) . Where a distinction can be made only in terms of pronunciation ( including prosody , or just prosody itself ) , the term accent may be preferred over dialect . Other types of speech varieties include jargons , which are characterized by differences in lexicon ( vocabulary ) ; slang ; patois ; pidgins ; and argots .
The word " public " implies the highest level of inclusivity – the public sphere by definition should be open to all . However , this sphere was only public to relative degrees . Enlightenment thinkers frequently contrasted their conception of the " public " with that of the people : Condorcet contrasted " opinion " with populace , Marmontel " the opinion of men of letters " with " the opinion of the multitude , " and d'Alembert the " truly enlightened public " with " the blind and noisy multitude " . Additionally , most institutions of the public sphere excluded both women and the lower classes . Cross-class influences occurred through noble and lower class participation in areas such as the coffeehouses and the Masonic lodges .

During the summer growing season , phosphate is at a high level . It has a vital role in the breakdown of the sugars manufactured by chlorophyll . But in the fall , phosphate , along with the other chemicals and nutrients , moves out of the leaf into the stem of the plant . When this happens , the sugar-breakdown process changes , leading to the production of anthocyanin pigments . The brighter the light during this period , the greater the production of anthocyanins and the more brilliant the resulting color display . When the days of autumn are bright and cool , and the nights are chilly but not freezing , the brightest colorations usually develop .

Jiangsu Volleyball men and women teams are also traditionally considered as at top level in China volleyball league .
During George 's reign the break-up of the British Empire and its transition into the Commonwealth of Nations accelerated . The parliament of the Irish Free State removed direct mention of the monarch from the country 's constitution on the day of his accession . From 1939 , the Empire and Commonwealth , except Ireland , was at war with Nazi Germany . War with Italy and Japan followed in 1940 and 1941 , respectively . Though Britain and its allies were ultimately victorious in 1945 , the United States and the Soviet Union rose as pre-eminent world powers and the British Empire declined . After the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947 , George remained as king of both countries , but the title Emperor of India was abandoned in June 1948 . Ireland formally declared itself a republic and left the Commonwealth in 1949 , and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year . George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth . He was beset by health problems in the later years of his reign . His elder daughter , Elizabeth , succeeded him .

During the reign of Mithridates I of Parthia , Arsacid control expanded to include Herat ( in 167 BC ) , Babylonia ( in 144 BC ) , Media ( in 141 BC ) , Persia ( in 139 BC ) , and large parts of Syria ( in the 110s BC ) . The Seleucid–Parthian wars continued as the Seleucids invaded Mesopotamia under Antiochus VII Sidetes ( r. 138–129 BC ) , but he was eventually killed by a Parthian counterattack . After the fall of the Seleucid dynasty , the Parthians fought frequently against neighbouring Rome in the Roman–Parthian Wars ( 66 BC – 217 AD ) . Abundant traces of Hellenism continued under the Parthian empire . The Parthians used Greek as well as their own Parthian language ( though lesser than Greek ) as languages of administration and also used Greek drachmas as coinage . They enjoyed Greek theater and Greek art influenced Parthian art . The Parthians continued worhipping Greek gods syncretized together with Iranian deities . Their rulers established ruler cults in the manner of Hellenistic kings and often used Hellenistic royal epithets .
The Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices . As of November 2008 , 67 % of registered voters in the city are Democrats . New York City has not been carried by a Republican in a statewide or presidential election since President Calvin Coolidge won the five boroughs in 1924 . In 2012 , Democrat Barack Obama became the first presidential candidate of any party to receive more than 80 % of the overall vote in New York City , sweeping all five boroughs . Party platforms center on affordable housing , education , and economic development , and labor politics are of importance in the city .
A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing . Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way , this form kills them . Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation , or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance , as in ambush predators . Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it , such as a jaguar or a human ; others may eat their ( usually much smaller ) prey whole , as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish , or a snake , duck or stork swallowing a frog . Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size ( domestic cats and dogs are prime examples ) may do either depending upon the circumstances ; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit . Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing , which the box jellyfish does , or disabling it , found in the behavior of the cone shell . In some cases , the venom , as in rattlesnakes and some spiders , contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating . In other cases , the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator . Baleen whales , for example , eat millions of microscopic plankton at once , the prey being broken down well after entering the whale . Seed predation and egg predation are other forms of true predation , as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms . Predators of this classification need not eat prey entirely . For example , some predators can not digest bones , while others can . Some may eat only part of an organism , as in grazing ( see below ) , but still consistently cause its direct death .
On February 7 , 1987 , dozens of political prisoners were freed in the first group release since Khrushchev 's " thaw " in the mid-1950s . On May 6 , 1987 , Pamyat , a Russian nationalist group , held an unsanctioned demonstration in Moscow . The authorities did not break up the demonstration and even kept traffic out of the demonstrators ' way while they marched to an impromptu meeting with Boris Yeltsin , head of the Moscow Communist Party and at the time one of Gorbachev 's closest allies . On July 25 , 1987 , 300 Crimean Tatars staged a noisy demonstration near the Kremlin Wall for several hours , calling for the right to return to their homeland , from which they were deported in 1944 ; police and soldiers merely looked on .
Launched worldwide across 2005–2006 , the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions , including North America and Europe . The earliest versions of the console suffered from a high failure rate , indicated by the so-called " Red Ring of Death " , necessitating an extension of the device 's warranty period . Microsoft released two redesigned models of the console : the Xbox 360 S in 2010 , and the Xbox 360 E in 2013 . As of June 2014 , 84 million Xbox 360 consoles have been sold worldwide , making it the sixth-highest-selling video game console in history , and the highest-selling console made by an American company . Although not the best-selling console of its generation , the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential through its emphasis on digital media distribution and multiplayer gaming on Xbox Live . The Xbox 360 's successor , the Xbox One , was released on November 22 , 2013 . Microsoft has stated they plan to support the Xbox 360 until 2016 . The Xbox One is also backwards compatible with the Xbox 360 .
The city also had a large class of free people of color . By 1860 , 3,785 free people of color were in Charleston , nearly 18 % of the city 's black population , and 8 % of the total population . Free people of color were far more likely to be of mixed racial background than slaves . Many were educated , practiced skilled crafts , and some even owned substantial property , including slaves . In 1790 , they established the Brown Fellowship Society for mutual aid , initially as a burial society . It continued until 1945 .
On July 8 , 2007 The Washington Post published excerpts from UCLA Professor Amy Zegart 's book Spying Blind : The CIA , the FBI , and the Origins of 9/11 . The Post reported from Zegart 's book that government documents show the CIA and FBI missed 23 potential chances to disrupt the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . The primary reasons for the failures included : agency cultures resistant to change and new ideas ; inappropriate incentives for promotion ; and a lack of cooperation between the FBI , CIA and the rest of the United States Intelligence Community . The book blamed the FBI 's decentralized structure , which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different FBI offices . The book suggested that the FBI has not evolved into an effective counter-terrorism or counter-intelligence agency , due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change . For example , FBI personnel practices continue to treat all staff other than special agents as support staff , classifying intelligence analysts alongside the FBI 's auto mechanics and janitors .
In 1976 John Goldsmith introduced autosegmental phonology . Phonological phenomena are no longer seen as operating on one linear sequence of segments , called phonemes or feature combinations , but rather as involving some parallel sequences of features which reside on multiple tiers . Autosegmental phonology later evolved into feature geometry , which became the standard theory of representation for theories of the organization of phonology as different as lexical phonology and optimality theory .
Chapter XI deals with evidence from biogeography , starting with the observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions can not be explained by environmental differences alone ; South America , Africa , and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes , but those regions have very different plants and animals . The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents . Darwin noted that barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions . The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the Isthmus of Panama was only a few miles wide . His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification . He went on to say : " On this principle of inheritance with modification , we can understand how it is that sections of genera , whole genera , and even families are confined to the same areas , as is so commonly and notoriously the case . " Darwin explained how a volcanic island formed a few hundred miles from a continent might be colonised by a few species from that continent . These species would become modified over time , but would still be related to species found on the continent , and Darwin observed that this was a common pattern . Darwin discussed ways that species could be dispersed across oceans to colonise islands , many of which he had investigated experimentally .
For the remainder of the Korean War the UN Command and the PVA fought , but exchanged little territory ; the stalemate held . Large-scale bombing of North Korea continued , and protracted armistice negotiations began 10 July 1951 at Kaesong . On the Chinese side , Zhou Enlai directed peace talks , and Li Kenong and Qiao Guanghua headed the negotiation team . Combat continued while the belligerents negotiated ; the UN Command forces ' goal was to recapture all of South Korea and to avoid losing territory . The PVA and the KPA attempted similar operations , and later effected military and psychological operations in order to test the UN Command 's resolve to continue the war .
During 1889 , Thomas Edison had business interests in many electricity-related companies : Edison Lamp Company , a lamp manufacturer in East Newark , New Jersey ; Edison Machine Works , a manufacturer of dynamos and large electric motors in Schenectady , New York ; Bergmann & Company , a manufacturer of electric lighting fixtures , sockets , and other electric lighting devices ; and Edison Electric Light Company , the patent-holding company and the financial arm backed by J.P. Morgan and the Vanderbilt family for Edison 's lighting experiments . In 1889 , Drexel , Morgan & Co. , a company founded by J.P. Morgan and Anthony J. Drexel , financed Edison 's research and helped merge those companies under one corporation to form Edison General Electric Company which was incorporated in New York on April 24 , 1889 . The new company also acquired Sprague Electric Railway & Motor Company in the same year .
Unknown to the Americans , the Soviet Moon program was in deep trouble . After two successive launch failures of the N1 rocket in 1969 , Soviet plans for a piloted landing suffered delay . The launch pad explosion of the N-1 on July 3 , 1969 was a significant setback . The rocket hit the pad after an engine shutdown , destroying itself and the launch facility . Without the N-1 rocket , the USSR could not send a large enough payload to the Moon to land a human and return him safely .
From his eastern origin Apollo brought the art of inspection of " symbols and omina " ( σημεία και τέρατα : semeia kai terata ) , and of the observation of the omens of the days . The inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from Anatolia . The ritualism belonged to Apollo from the beginning . The Greeks created the legalism , the supervision of the orders of the gods , and the demand for moderation and harmony . Apollo became the god of shining youth , the protector of music , spiritual-life , moderation and perceptible order . The improvement of the old Anatolian god , and his elevation to an intellectual sphere , may be considered an achievement of the Greek people .
The American Civil War boosted the local economy with wartime purchases of industrial goods , including that of the New Haven Arms Company , which would later become the Winchester Repeating Arms Company . ( Winchester would continue to produce arms in New Haven until 2006 , and many of the buildings that were a part of the Winchester plant are now a part of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company Historic District . ) After the war , population grew and doubled by the start of the 20th century , most notably due to the influx of immigrants from southern Europe , particularly Italy . Today , roughly half the populations of East Haven , West Haven , and North Haven are Italian-American . Jewish immigration to New Haven has left an enduring mark on the city . Westville was the center of Jewish life in New Haven , though today many have fanned out to suburban communities such as Woodbridge and Cheshire .
A 2009 Cochrane review concluded that thiazide antihypertensive drugs reduce the risk of death ( RR 0.89 ) , stroke ( RR 0.63 ) , coronary heart disease ( RR 0.84 ) , and cardiovascular events ( RR 0.70 ) in people with high blood pressure . In the ensuring years other classes of antihypertensive drug were developed and found wide acceptance in combination therapy , including loop diuretics ( Lasix/furosemide , Hoechst Pharmaceuticals , 1963 ) , beta blockers ( ICI Pharmaceuticals , 1964 ) ACE inhibitors , and angiotensin receptor blockers . ACE inhibitors reduce the risk of new onset kidney disease [ RR 0.71 ] and death [ RR 0.84 ] in diabetic patients , irrespective of whether they have hypertension .

His or her role is to ensure the MoD operates effectively as a department of the government .
In its 2014 Press Freedom Index , Reporters Without Borders ranked the media environment in Eritrea at the very bottom of a list of 178 countries , just below totalitarian North Korea . According to the BBC , " Eritrea is the only African country to have no privately owned news media " , and Reporters Without Borders said of the public media , " [ they ] do nothing but relay the regime 's belligerent and ultra-nationalist discourse . ... Not a single [ foreign correspondent ] now lives in Asmara . " The state-owned news agency censors news about external events . Independent media have been banned since 2001 . In 2015 , The Guardian published an opinion piece claiming ,
In the 11th century , documents written in macaronic Latin begin to show Catalan elements , with texts written almost completely in Romance appearing by 1080 . Old Catalan shared many features with Gallo-Romance , diverging from Old Occitan between the 11th and 14th centuries .
Managers in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team , including the training , team selection , and player acquisition . Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans . Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available , and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B ' and 'A ' Licences . The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis ( i.e . more than 12 weeks – the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control ) . Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment . Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker ; examples include Paul Hart at Portsmouth and David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur .
The canal is 193.30 km ( 120.11 mi ) long , 24 m ( 79 ft ) deep and 205 metres ( 673 ft ) wide as of 2010 . It consists of the northern access channel of 22 km ( 14 mi ) , the canal itself of 162.25 km ( 100.82 mi ) and the southern access channel of 9 km ( 5.6 mi ) . The canal is a single lane with passing places in the " Ballah By-Pass " and the Great Bitter Lake . It contains no locks ; seawater flows freely through the canal . In general , the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer . The current south of the lakes changes with the tide at Suez .
Despite Martin Luther 's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints , theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church . He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God . Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther , some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854 , was a firm adherent of that view . Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception , which , at that time was undefined in the Church , maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life . For Luther , early in his life , the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact , although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast . Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death . " Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer , Luther preached , taught , and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics . His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety . " Luther , while revering Mary , came to criticize the " Papists " for blurring the line , between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being , and religious service given to another creature . He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints ' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry . His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death :
In Britain and some other armies , the single artillery branch has been responsible for both home and overseas ground-based air defence , although there was divided responsibility with the Royal Navy for air defence of the British Isles in World War I . However , during the Second World War the RAF Regiment was formed to protect airfields everywhere , and this included light air defences . In the later decades of the Cold War this included the United States Air Force 's operating bases in UK . However , all ground-based air defence was removed from Royal Air Force ( RAF ) jurisdiction in 2004 . The British Army 's Anti-Aircraft Command was disbanded in March 1955 , but during the 1960s and 1970s the RAF 's Fighter Command operated long-range air -defence missiles to protect key areas in the UK . During World War II the Royal Marines also provided air defence units ; formally part of the mobile naval base defence organisation , they were handled as an integral part of the army-commanded ground based air defences .
Devotion is an important part of the practice of most Buddhists . Devotional practices include bowing , offerings , pilgrimage , and chanting . In Pure Land Buddhism , devotion to the Buddha Amitabha is the main practice . In Nichiren Buddhism , devotion to the Lotus Sutra is the main practice .

In 1671 , Robert Boyle discovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids , which results in the production of hydrogen gas . In 1766 , Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance , by naming the gas from a metal-acid reaction " flammable air " . He speculated that " flammable air " was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance called " phlogiston " and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned . He is usually given credit for its discovery as an element . In 1783 , Antoine Lavoisier gave the element the name hydrogen ( from the Greek ὑδρο- hydro meaning " water " and -γενής genes meaning " creator " ) when he and Laplace reproduced Cavendish 's finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned .

The graphic novel—book-length comics—began to gain attention after Will Eisner popularized the term with his book A Contract with God ( 1978 ) . The term became widely known with the public after the commercial success of Maus , Watchmen , and The Dark Knight Returns in the mid-1980s . In the 21st century graphic novels became established in mainstream bookstores and libraries and webcomics became common .
In 1629 , the Massachusetts Bay Colony 's first governor , John Winthrop , led the signing of the Cambridge Agreement , a key founding document of the city . Puritan ethics and their focus on education influenced its early history ; America 's first public school was founded in Boston in 1635 . Over the next 130 years , the city participated in four French and Indian Wars , until the British defeated the French and their native allies in North America . Boston was the largest town in British North America until Philadelphia grew larger in the mid 18th century .
From childhood , Gaddafi was aware of the involvement of European colonialists in Libya ; his nation was occupied by Italy , and during the North African Campaign of World War II it witnessed conflict between Italian and British troops . According to later claims , Gaddafi 's paternal grandfather , Abdessalam Bouminyar , was killed by the Italian Army during the Italian invasion of 1911 . At World War II 's end in 1945 , Libya was occupied by British and French forces . Although Britain and France intended on dividing the nation between their empires , the General Assembly of the United Nations ( UN ) declared that the country be granted political independence . In 1951 , the UN created the United Kingdom of Libya , a federal state under the leadership of a pro-western monarch , Idris , who banned political parties and established an absolute monarchy .
Even with the five largest cities in Sichuan suffering only minor damage from the quake , some estimates of the economic loss run higher than US $ 75 billion , making the earthquake one of the costliest natural disasters in Chinese history .
However , all of these facets of medieval university life are considered by standard scholarship to be independent medieval European developments with no tracable Islamic influence . Generally , some reviewers have pointed out the strong inclination of Makdisi of overstating his case by simply resting on " the accumulation of close parallels " , but all the while failing to point to convincing channels of transmission between the Muslim and Christian world . Norman Daniel points out that the Arab equivalent of the Latin disputation , the taliqa , was reserved for the ruler 's court , not the madrasa , and that the actual differences between Islamic fiqh and medieval European civil law were profound . The taliqa only reached Islamic Spain , the only likely point of transmission , after the establishment of the first medieval universities . In fact , there is no Latin translation of the taliqa and , most importantly , no evidence of Latin scholars ever showing awareness of Arab influence on the Latin method of disputation , something they would have certainly found noteworthy . Rather , it was the medieval reception of the Greek Organon which set the scholastic sic et non in motion . Daniel concludes that resemblances in method had more to with the two religions having " common problems : to reconcile the conflicting statements of their own authorities , and to safeguard the data of revelation from the impact of Greek philosophy " ; thus Christian scholasticism and similar Arab concepts should be viewed in terms of a parallel occurrence , not of the transmission of ideas from one to the other , a view shared by Hugh Kennedy .
As the Kulluk oil rig was being towed to the American state of Washington to be serviced in preparation for the 2013 drilling season , a winter storm on 27 December 2012 caused the towing crews , as well as the rescue service , to lose control of the situation . As of 1 January 2013 , the Kulluk was grounded off the coast Sitkalidak Island , near the eastern end of Kodiak Island . Following the accident , a Fortune magazine contacted Larry McKinney , the executive director at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A & M , and he explained that " A two-month delay in the Arctic is not a two-month delay ... A two-month delay could wipe out the entire drilling season . "
Research focusing on sexual orientation uses scales of assessment to identify who belongs in which sexual population group . It is assumed that these scales will be able to reliably identify and categorize people by their sexual orientation . However , it is difficult to determine an individual 's sexual orientation through scales of assessment , due to ambiguity regarding the definition of sexual orientation . Generally , there are three components of sexual orientation used in assessment . Their definitions and examples of how they may be assessed are as follows :
The UK government has spent £250 million in the construction of the island 's airport . Expected to be fully operational early 2016 , it is expected to help the island towards self-sufficiency and encourage economic development , reducing dependence on British government aid . The airport is also expected to kick start the tourism industry , with up to 30,000 visitors expected annually . As of August , 2015 ticketing was postponed until an airline could be firmly designated .
There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game , each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines . The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football , although certain modifications for groups such as juniors , seniors , women and people with physical disabilities are permitted . The laws are often framed in broad terms , which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game . The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA , but are maintained by the International Football Association Board ( IFAB ) . In addition to the seventeen laws , numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football .
Congress often enacts statutes that grant broad rulemaking authority to federal agencies . Often , Congress is simply too gridlocked to draft detailed statutes that explain how the agency should react to every possible situation , or Congress believes the agency 's technical specialists are best equipped to deal with particular fact situations as they arise . Therefore , federal agencies are authorized to promulgate regulations . Under the principle of Chevron deference , regulations normally carry the force of law as long as they are based on a reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes .
Louis XVI and the royal family were brought to Paris and made virtual prisoners within the Tuileries Palace . In 1793 , as the revolution turned more and more radical , the king , queen , and the mayor were guillotined , along with more than 16,000 others ( throughout France ) , during the Reign of Terror . The property of the aristocracy and the church was nationalised , and the city 's churches were closed , sold or demolished . A succession of revolutionary factions ruled Paris until 9 November 1799 ( coup d'état du 18 brumaire ) , when Napoléon Bonaparte seized power as First Consul .
Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies , which may also produce—or inhibit—social shifts and changes in cultural practices . War or competition over resources may impact technological development or social dynamics . Additionally , cultural ideas may transfer from one society to another , through diffusion or acculturation . In diffusion , the form of something ( though not necessarily its meaning ) moves from one culture to another . For example , hamburgers , fast food in the United States , seemed exotic when introduced into China . " Stimulus diffusion " ( the sharing of ideas ) refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention or propagation in another . " Direct Borrowing " on the other hand tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from one culture to another . Diffusion of innovations theory presents a research-based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new ideas , practices , and products .
Local anesthetic injections into the nerves or sensitive areas of the stump may relieve pain for days , weeks , or sometimes permanently , despite the drug wearing off in a matter of hours ; and small injections of hypertonic saline into the soft tissue between vertebrae produces local pain that radiates into the phantom limb for ten minutes or so and may be followed by hours , weeks or even longer of partial or total relief from phantom pain . Vigorous vibration or electrical stimulation of the stump , or current from electrodes surgically implanted onto the spinal cord , all produce relief in some patients .
However many early history books like the Islamic Conquest of Syria Fatuhusham by al-Imam al-Waqidi state that after the conversion to Islam Muawiyah 's father Abu Sufyan ibn Harb and his brothers Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan were appointed as commanders in the Muslim armies by Muhammad . Muawiyah , Abu Sufyan ibn Harb , Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan and Hind bint Utbah fought in the Battle of Yarmouk . The defeat of the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius at the Battle of Yarmouk opened the way for the Muslim expansion into Jerusalem and Syria .
Victoria later described her childhood as " rather melancholy " . Her mother was extremely protective , and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called " Kensington System " , an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller , Sir John Conroy , who was rumoured to be the Duchess 's lover . The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable ( including most of her father 's family ) , and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them . The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William 's bastard children , and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety . Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night , studied with private tutors to a regular timetable , and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel , Dash . Her lessons included French , German , Italian , and Latin , but she spoke only English at home .
Meanwhile , producer Joe Pasternak , who had been successfully producing light musicals with young sopranos for Universal 's German subsidiary , repeated his formula in America . Teenage singer Deanna Durbin starred in Pasternak 's first American film , Three Smart Girls ( 1936 ) . The film was a box-office hit and reputedly restored the studio 's solvency . The success of the film led Universal to offer her a contract , which for the first five years of her career produced her most successful pictures .
Adult insects typically move about by walking , flying , or sometimes swimming ( see below , Locomotion ) . As it allows for rapid yet stable movement , many insects adopt a tripedal gait in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating triangles . Insects are the only invertebrates to have evolved flight . Many insects spend at least part of their lives under water , with larval adaptations that include gills , and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for swimming . Some species , such as water striders , are capable of walking on the surface of water . Insects are mostly solitary , but some , such as certain bees , ants and termites , are social and live in large , well-organized colonies . Some insects , such as earwigs , show maternal care , guarding their eggs and young . Insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways . Male moths can sense the pheromones of female moths over great distances . Other species communicate with sounds : crickets stridulate , or rub their wings together , to attract a mate and repel other males . Lampyridae in the beetle order Coleoptera communicate with light .
At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards , Beyoncé received ten nominations , including Album of the Year for I Am ... Sasha Fierce , Record of the Year for " Halo " , and Song of the Year for " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) " , among others . She tied with Lauryn Hill for most Grammy nominations in a single year by a female artist . In 2010 , Beyoncé was featured on Lady Gaga 's single " Telephone " and its music video . The song topped the US Pop Songs chart , becoming the sixth number-one for both Beyoncé and Gaga , tying them with Mariah Carey for most number-ones since the Nielsen Top 40 airplay chart launched in 1992 . " Telephone " received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals .
After a debate , the 129 delegates passed Hardie 's motion to establish " a distinct Labour group in Parliament , who shall have their own whips , and agree upon their policy , which must embrace a readiness to cooperate with any party which for the time being may be engaged in promoting legislation in the direct interests of labour . " This created an association called the Labour Representation Committee ( LRC ) , meant to coordinate attempts to support MPs sponsored by trade unions and represent the working-class population . It had no single leader , and in the absence of one , the Independent Labour Party nominee Ramsay MacDonald was elected as Secretary . He had the difficult task of keeping the various strands of opinions in the LRC united . The October 1900 " Khaki election " came too soon for the new party to campaign effectively ; total expenses for the election only came to £33 . Only 15 candidatures were sponsored , but two were successful ; Keir Hardie in Merthyr Tydfil and Richard Bell in Derby .
A significant portion of historical writing ranks as literature , particularly the genre known as creative nonfiction , as can a great deal of journalism , such as literary journalism . However , these areas have become extremely large , and often have a primarily utilitarian purpose : to record data or convey immediate information . As a result , the writing in these fields often lacks a literary quality , although it often ( and in its better moments ) has that quality . Major " literary " historians include Herodotus , Thucydides and Procopius , all of whom count as canonical literary figures .
This method produces the clear plastic blank part of the disc . After a metallic reflecting layer ( usually aluminium , but sometimes gold or other metal ) is applied to the clear blank substrate , the disc goes under a UV light for curing and it is ready to go to press . To prepare to press a CD , a glass master is made , using a high-powered laser on a device similar to a CD writer . The glass master is a positive image of the desired CD surface ( with the desired microscopic pits and lands ) . After testing , it is used to make a die by pressing it against a metal disc .
The standard PlayStation 3 version of the XrossMediaBar ( pronounced Cross Media Bar , or abbreviated XMB ) includes nine categories of options . These are : Users , Settings , Photo , Music , Video , TV/Video Services , Game , Network , PlayStation Network and Friends ( similar to the PlayStation Portable media bar ) . TheTV/Video Services category is for services like Netflix and/or if PlayTV or torne is installed ; the first category in this section is " My Channels " , which lets users download various streaming services , including Sony 's own streaming services Crackle and PlayStation Vue . By default , the What 's New section of PlayStation Network is displayed when the system starts up . PS3 includes the ability to store various master and secondary user profiles , manage and explore photos with or without a musical slide show , play music and copy audio CD tracks to an attached data storage device , play movies and video files from the hard disk drive , an optical disc ( Blu-ray Disc or DVD-Video ) or an optional USB mass storage or Flash card , compatibility for a USB keyboard and mouse and a web browser supporting compatible-file download function . Additionally , UPnP media will appear in the respective audio/video/photo categories if a compatible media server or DLNA server is detected on the local network . The Friends menu allows mail with emoticon and attached picture features and video chat which requires an optional PlayStation Eye or EyeToy webcam . The Network menu allows online shopping through the PlayStation Store and connectivity to PlayStation Portable via Remote Play .
Wang and Nyima state that after the official title " Education Minister " was granted to Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen ( 1302–1364 ) by the Yuan court , this title appeared frequently with his name in various Tibetan texts , while his Tibetan title " Degsi " ( sic properly sde-srid or desi ) is seldom mentioned . Wang and Nyima take this to mean that " even in the later period of the Yuan dynasty , the Yuan imperial court and the Phagmodrupa Dynasty maintained a Central-local government relation . " The Tai Situpa is even supposed to have written in his will : " In the past I received loving care from the emperor in the east . If the emperor continues to care for us , please follow his edicts and the imperial envoy should be well received . "
Marvel first licensed two prose novels to Bantam Books , who printed The Avengers Battle the Earth Wrecker by Otto Binder ( 1967 ) and Captain America : The Great Gold Steal by Ted White ( 1968 ) . Various publishers took up the licenses from 1978 to 2002 . Also , with the various licensed films being released beginning in 1997 , various publishers put out movie novelizations . In 2003 , following publication of the prose young adult novel Mary Jane , starring Mary Jane Watson from the Spider-Man mythos , Marvel announced the formation of the publishing imprint Marvel Press . However , Marvel moved back to licensing with Pocket Books from 2005 to 2008 . With few books issued under the imprint , Marvel and Disney Books Group relaunched Marvel Press in 2011 with the Marvel Origin Storybooks line .
Detroit has four border crossings : the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel provide motor vehicle thoroughfares , with the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel providing railroad access to and from Canada . The fourth border crossing is the Detroit–Windsor Truck Ferry , located near the Windsor Salt Mine and Zug Island . Near Zug Island , the southwest part of the city was developed over a 1,500-acre ( 610 ha ) salt mine that is 1,100 feet ( 340 m ) below the surface . The Detroit Salt Company mine has over 100 miles ( 160 km ) of roads within .
In the United States and Canada , the film opened on 6 November 2015 , and in its opening weekend , was originally projected to gross $ 70–75 million from 3,927 screens , the widest release for a Bond film . However , after grossing $ 5.25 million from its early Thursday night showings and $ 28 million on its opening day , weekend projections were increased to $ 75–80 million . The film ended up grossing $ 70.4 million in its opening weekend ( about $ 20 million less than Skyfall 's $ 90.6 million debut , including IMAX previews ) , but nevertheless finished first at the box office . IMAX generated $ 9.1 million for Spectre at 374 screens , premium large format made $ 8 million from 429 cinemas , reaping 11 % of the film 's opening , which means that Spectre earned $ 17.1 million ( 23 % ) of its opening weekend total in large-format venues . Cinemark XD generated $ 1.85 million in 112 XD locations .
Muslim physicians contributed to the field of medicine , including the subjects of anatomy and physiology : such as in the 15th century Persian work by Mansur ibn Muhammad ibn al-Faqih Ilyas entitled Tashrih al-badan ( Anatomy of the body ) which contained comprehensive diagrams of the body 's structural , nervous and circulatory systems ; or in the work of the Egyptian physician Ibn al-Nafis , who proposed the theory of pulmonary circulation . Avicenna 's The Canon of Medicine remained an authoritative medical textbook in Europe until the 18th century . Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi ( also known as Abulcasis ) contributed to the discipline of medical surgery with his Kitab al-Tasrif ( " Book of Concessions " ) , a medical encyclopedia which was later translated to Latin and used in European and Muslim medical schools for centuries . Other medical advancements came in the fields of pharmacology and pharmacy .
Apollo 11 was prepared with the goal of a July landing in the Sea of Tranquility . The crew , selected in January 1969 , consisted of commander ( CDR ) Neil Armstrong , Command Module Pilot ( CMP ) Michael Collins , and Lunar Module Pilot ( LMP ) Edwin " Buzz " Aldrin . They trained for the mission until just before the actual launch day . On July 16 , 1969 , at exactly 9:32 am EDT , the Saturn V rocket , AS-506 , lifted off from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 in Florida .
Fox announced on May 11 , 2015 that the fifteenth season would be the final season of American Idol ; as such , the season is expected to have an additional focus on the program 's alumni . Ryan Seacrest returns as host , with Harry Connick Jr. , Keith Urban , and Jennifer Lopez all returning for their respective third , fourth , and fifth seasons as judges .
The British dealt with range measurement first , when it was realised that range was the key to producing a better fuse setting . This led to the Height/Range Finder ( HRF ) , the first model being the Barr & Stroud UB2 , a 2-metre optical coincident rangefinder mounted on a tripod . It measured the distance to the target and the elevation angle , which together gave the height of the aircraft . These were complex instruments and various other methods were also used . The HRF was soon joined by the Height/Fuse Indicator ( HFI ) , this was marked with elevation angles and height lines overlaid with fuse length curves , using the height reported by the HRF operator , the necessary fuse length could be read off .
The Frankish kingdom in northern Gaul split into kingdoms called Austrasia , Neustria , and Burgundy during the 6th and 7th centuries , all of them ruled by the Merovingian dynasty , who were descended from Clovis . The 7th century was a tumultuous period of wars between Austrasia and Neustria . Such warfare was exploited by Pippin ( d. 640 ) , the Mayor of the Palace for Austrasia who became the power behind the Austrasian throne . Later members of his family inherited the office , acting as advisers and regents . One of his descendants , Charles Martel ( d. 741 ) , won the Battle of Poitiers in 732 , halting the advance of Muslim armies across the Pyrenees . [ K ] Great Britain was divided into small states dominated by the kingdoms of Northumbria , Mercia , Wessex , and East Anglia , which were descended from the Anglo-Saxon invaders . Smaller kingdoms in present-day Wales and Scotland were still under the control of the native Britons and Picts . Ireland was divided into even smaller political units , usually known as tribal kingdoms , under the control of kings . There were perhaps as many as 150 local kings in Ireland , of varying importance .
The use of uranium in its natural oxide form dates back to at least the year 79 CE , when it was used to add a yellow color to ceramic glazes . Yellow glass with 1 % uranium oxide was found in a Roman villa on Cape Posillipo in the Bay of Naples , Italy , by R. T. Gunther of the University of Oxford in 1912 . Starting in the late Middle Ages , pitchblende was extracted from the Habsburg silver mines in Joachimsthal , Bohemia ( now Jáchymov in the Czech Republic ) , and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry . In the early 19th century , the world 's only known sources of uranium ore were these mines .
Unlike in higher animals , where parthenogenesis is rare , asexual reproduction may occur in plants by several different mechanisms . The formation of stem tubers in potato is one example . Particularly in arctic or alpine habitats , where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers by animals are rare , plantlets or bulbs , may develop instead of flowers , replacing sexual reproduction with asexual reproduction and giving rise to clonal populations genetically identical to the parent . This is one of several types of apomixis that occur in plants . Apomixis can also happen in a seed , producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent .
During the listing process , economic factors can not be considered , but must be " based solely on the best scientific and commercial data available . " The 1982 amendment to the ESA added the word " solely " to prevent any consideration other than the biological status of the species . Congress rejected President Ronald Reagan 's Executive Order 12291 which required economic analysis of all government agency actions . The House committee 's statement was " that economic considerations have no relevance to determinations regarding the status of species . "
In 2005 , the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1624 concerning incitement to commit acts of terrorism and the obligations of countries to comply with international human rights laws . Although both resolutions require mandatory annual reports on counter-terrorism activities by adopting nations , the United States and Israel have both declined to submit reports . In the same year , the United States Department of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a planning document , by the name " National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism " , which stated that it constituted the " comprehensive military plan to prosecute the Global War on Terror for the Armed Forces of the United States ... including the findings and recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and a rigorous examination with the Department of Defense " .
The outbreak of World War I in 1914 was precipitated by the rise of nationalism in Southeastern Europe as the Great Powers took up sides . The Allies defeated the Central Powers in 1918 . During the Paris Peace Conference the Big Four imposed their terms in a series of treaties , especially the Treaty of Versailles .
The Royal Institute of British Architects ( RIBA ) is a professional body for architects primarily in the United Kingdom , but also internationally , founded for the advancement of architecture under its charter granted in 1837 and Supplemental Charter granted in 1971 .
Hume divided all of human knowledge into two categories : relations of ideas and matters of fact ( see also Kant 's analytic-synthetic distinction ) . Mathematical and logical propositions ( e.g . " that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two sides " ) are examples of the first , while propositions involving some contingent observation of the world ( e.g . " the sun rises in the East " ) are examples of the second . All of people 's " ideas " , in turn , are derived from their " impressions " . For Hume , an " impression " corresponds roughly with what we call a sensation . To remember or to imagine such impressions is to have an " idea " . Ideas are therefore the faint copies of sensations .
The transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture is not necessarily a one way process . It has been argued that hunting and gathering represents an adaptive strategy , which may still be exploited , if necessary , when environmental change causes extreme food stress for agriculturalists . In fact , it is sometimes difficult to draw a clear line between agricultural and hunter-gatherer societies , especially since the widespread adoption of agriculture and resulting cultural diffusion that has occurred in the last 10,000 years . [ citation needed ] This anthropological view has remained unchanged since the 1960s . [ clarification needed ] [ citation needed ]
In addition to the change in the mean length of the calendar year from 365.25 days ( 365 days 6 hours ) to 365.2425 days ( 365 days 5 hours 49 minutes 12 seconds ) , a reduction of 10 minutes 48 seconds per year , the Gregorian calendar reform also dealt with the accumulated difference between these lengths . The canonical Easter tables were devised at the end of the third century , when the vernal equinox fell either on 20 March or 21 March depending on the year 's position in the leap year cycle . As the rule was that the full moon preceding Easter was not to precede the equinox the equinox was fixed at 21 March for computational purposes and the earliest date for Easter was fixed at 22 March . The Gregorian calendar reproduced these conditions by removing ten days .
The most common staple crops consumed during Han were wheat , barley , foxtail millet , proso millet , rice , and beans . Commonly eaten fruits and vegetables included chestnuts , pears , plums , peaches , melons , apricots , strawberries , red bayberries , jujubes , calabash , bamboo shoots , mustard plant and taro . Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens , Mandarin ducks , geese , cows , sheep , pigs , camels and dogs ( various types were bred specifically for food , while most were used as pets ) . Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes . Commonly hunted game , such as owl , pheasant , magpie , sika deer , and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed . Seasonings included sugar , honey , salt and soy sauce . Beer and wine were regularly consumed .
Today Saint Helena has its own currency , the Saint Helena pound , which is at parity with the pound sterling . The government of Saint Helena produces its own coinage and banknotes . The Bank of Saint Helena was established on Saint Helena and Ascension Island in 2004 . It has branches in Jamestown on Saint Helena , and Georgetown , Ascension Island and it took over the business of the St. Helena government savings bank and Ascension Island Savings Bank .
The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world , broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people . In the 2014–15 season , the average Premier League match attendance exceeded 36,000 , second highest of any professional football league behind the Bundesliga 's 43,500 . Most stadium occupancies are near capacity . The Premier League rank second in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons .
The law of the Eastern Catholic Churches in full union with Rome was in much the same state as that of the Latin or Western Church before 1917 ; much more diversity in legislation existed in the various Eastern Catholic Churches . Each had its own special law , in which custom still played an important part . In 1929 Pius XI informed the Eastern Churches of his intention to work out a Code for the whole of the Eastern Church . The publication of these Codes for the Eastern Churches regarding the law of persons was made between 1949 through 1958 but finalized nearly 30 years later .
Models suggest that Neptune 's troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on altitude . The upper-level clouds lie at pressures below one bar , where the temperature is suitable for methane to condense . For pressures between one and five bars ( 100 and 500 kPa ) , clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are thought to form . Above a pressure of five bars , the clouds may consist of ammonia , ammonium sulfide , hydrogen sulfide and water . Deeper clouds of water ice should be found at pressures of about 50 bars ( 5.0 MPa ) , where the temperature reaches 273 K ( 0 °C ) . Underneath , clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide may be found .
In Japan , professional wrestling done by female wrestlers is called joshi puroresu ( 女子プロレス ) or joshi puro for short . Female wrestling is usually handled by promotions that specialize in joshi puroresu rather than divisions of otherwise male-dominated promotions , as is the case in the United States . However , joshi puroresu promotions usually have agreements with male puroresu promotions such that they recognize each other 's titles as legitimate , and may share cards . All Japan Women 's Pro-Wrestling was the dominant joshi organization from the 1970s to the 1990s .
This period also saw some contacts with Jesuits and Capuchins from Europe , and in 1774 a Scottish nobleman , George Bogle , came to Shigatse to investigate prospects of trade for the British East India Company . However , in the 19th century the situation of foreigners in Tibet grew more tenuous . The British Empire was encroaching from northern India into the Himalayas , the Emirate of Afghanistan and the Russian Empire were expanding into Central Asia and each power became suspicious of the others ' intentions in Tibet .
In September 2003 , retired four-star general Wesley Clark announced his intention to run in the presidential primary election for the Democratic Party nomination . His campaign focused on themes of leadership and patriotism ; early campaign ads relied heavily on biography . His late start left him with relatively few detailed policy proposals . This weakness was apparent in his first few debates , although he soon presented a range of position papers , including a major tax-relief plan . Nevertheless , the Democrats did not flock to support his campaign .
Although Germany used forced labourers in most occupied countries , Poles and other Slavs were viewed as inferior by Nazi propaganda , thus , better suited for such duties . Between 1 and 2.5 million Polish citizens were transported to the Reich for forced labour , against their will . All Polish males were required to perform forced labour . While ethnic Poles were subject to selective persecution , all ethnic Jews were targeted by the Reich . In the winter of 1939–40 , about 100,000 Jews were thus deported to Poland . They were initially gathered into massive urban ghettos , such as 380,000 held in the Warsaw Ghetto , where large numbers died under the harsh conditions therein , including 43,000 in the Warsaw Ghetto alone . Poles and ethnic Jews were imprisoned in nearly every camp of the extensive concentration camp system in German-occupied Poland and the Reich . In Auschwitz , which began operating on 14 June 1940 , 1.1 million people died .
The 2009 Human Development Report by UNDP was released on October 5 , 2009 , and covers the period up to 2007 . It was titled " Overcoming barriers : Human mobility and development " . The top countries by HDI were grouped in a new category called " very high human development " . The report refers to these countries as developed countries . They are :
During most of the war , the UN navies patrolled the west and east coasts of North Korea , sinking supply and ammunition ships and denying the North Koreans the ability to resupply from the sea . Aside from very occasional gunfire from North Korean shore batteries , the main threat to United States and UN navy ships was from magnetic mines . During the war , five U.S. Navy ships were lost to mines : two minesweepers , two minesweeper escorts , and one ocean tug . Mines and gunfire from North Korean coastal artillery damaged another 87 U.S. warships , resulting in slight to moderate damage .
Hayek is widely recognised for having introduced the time dimension to the equilibrium construction and for his key role in helping inspire the fields of growth theory , information economics , and the theory of spontaneous order . The " informal " economics presented in Milton Friedman 's massively influential popular work Free to Choose ( 1980 ) , is explicitly Hayekian in its account of the price system as a system for transmitting and co-ordinating knowledge . This can be explained by the fact that Friedman taught Hayek 's famous paper " The Use of Knowledge in Society " ( 1945 ) in his graduate seminars .
In practical terms , a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions , as do the programs for word processors and web browsers for example . A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second ( gigaflops ) and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation . Large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to write , and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors .
In 2008 , extreme waves and high tides caused widespread flooding in the capital city of Majuro and other urban centres , 3 feet ( 0.91 m ) above sea level . On Christmas morning in 2008 , the government declared a state of emergency . In 2013 , heavy waves once again breached the city walls of Majuro .
Chopin seldom performed publicly in Paris . In later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the Salle Pleyel , a venue that seated three hundred . He played more frequently at salons , but preferred playing at his own Paris apartment for small groups of friends . The musicologist Arthur Hedley has observed that " As a pianist Chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances—few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime . " The list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts provides an indication of the richness of Parisian artistic life during this period . Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833 , in which Chopin , Liszt and Hiller performed ( on pianos ) a concerto by J.S . Bach for three keyboards ; and , on 3 March 1838 , a concert in which Chopin , his pupil Adolphe Gutmann , Charles-Valentin Alkan , and Alkan 's teacher Joseph Zimmermann performed Alkan 's arrangement , for eight hands , of two movements from Beethoven 's 7th symphony . Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt 's Hexameron ; he wrote the sixth ( and final ) variation on Bellini 's theme . Chopin 's music soon found success with publishers , and in 1833 he contracted with Maurice Schlesinger , who arranged for it to be published not only in France but , through his family connections , also in Germany and England .
Of the 80 torch-bearers in London , Sir Steve Redgrave , who started the relay , mentioned to the media that he had received e-mailed pleas to boycott the event and could " see why they would like to make an issue " of it . Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch , while Konnie Huq decided to carry it and also speak out against China . The pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker asked all bearers to reconsider . Amid pressure from both directions , Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it . The London relay saw the torch surrounded by what the BBC described as " a mobile protective ring . " Protests began as soon as Redgrave started the event , leading to at least thirty-five arrests . In Ladbroke Grove a demonstrator attempted to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq in a momentary struggle , and in a separate incident , a fire extinguisher was set off near the torch . The Chinese ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown after an unpublicized change to the route amid security concerns . The torch made an unscheduled move onto a bus along Fleet Street amid security concerns and efforts to evade the protesters . In an effort to counter the pro-Tibet protesters and show their support for the 2008 Beijing Olympics , more than 2,000 Chinese also gathered on the torch route and demonstrated with signs , banners and Chinese flags . A large number of supporters were concentrated in Trafalgar Square , displaying the Olympic slogan " One World , One Dream " .
A Macau resident was arrested on April 26 for posting a message on cyberctm.com encouraging people to disrupt the relay . Both orchidbbs.com and cyberctm.com Internet forums were shut down from May 2 to 4 . This fueled speculation that the shutdowns were targeting speeches against the relay . The head of the Bureau of Telecommunications Regulation has denied that the shutdowns of the websites were politically motivated . About 2,200 police were deployed on the streets , there were no interruptions .

From the beginning of 2014 , Madonna began to make multiple media appearances . She appeared at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in January 2014 , performing " Open Your Heart " alongside rappers Macklemore & Ryan Lewis and singer Mary Lambert , who sang their single " Same Love " , as 33 couples were wed onstage , officiated by Queen Latifah . Days later , she joined singer Miley Cyrus on her MTV Unplugged special , singing a mash-up of " Do n't Tell Me " and Cyrus ' single " We Ca n't Stop " ( 2013 ) . She also extended her business ventures and in February 2014 the singer premiered MDNA Skin , a range of skin care products , in Tokyo , Japan . After visiting her hometown of Detroit during May 2014 , Madonna decided to contribute funds to three of the city 's organizations , to help eliminate poverty from there . The singer released a statement saying that she was inspired by their work , adding that " it was obvious to me that I had to get involved and be part of the solution to help Detroit recover " .
Beginning his second effort that fall , West would invest two million dollars and take over a year to craft his second album . West was significantly inspired by Roseland NYC Live , a 1998 live album by English trip hop group Portishead , produced with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra . Early in his career , the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip-hop production . Though West had not been able to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album , the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album Late Registration . West collaborated with American film score composer Jon Brion , who served as the album 's co-executive producer for several tracks . Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records , he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre . Late Registration sold over 2.3 million units in the United States alone by the end of 2005 and was considered by industry observers as the only successful major album release of the fall season , which had been plagued by steadily declining CD sales .
Following a custom she maintained throughout her widowhood , Victoria spent the Christmas of 1900 at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight . Rheumatism in her legs had rendered her lame , and her eyesight was clouded by cataracts . Through early January , she felt " weak and unwell " , and by mid-January she was " drowsy ... dazed , [ and ] confused " . She died on Tuesday , 22 January 1901 , at half past six in the evening , at the age of 81 . Her son and successor King Edward VII , and her eldest grandson , Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany , were at her deathbed . Her favourite pet Pomeranian , Turri , was laid upon her deathbed as a last request .
A desire to be closer to the urban scene has also attracted some young professionals to reside in inner ring suburbs such as Grosse Pointe and Royal Oak , Detroit . Detroit 's proximity to Windsor , Ontario , provides for views and nightlife , along with Ontario 's minimum drinking age of 19 . A 2011 study by Walk Score recognized Detroit for its above average walkability among large U.S. cities . About two-thirds of suburban residents occasionally dine and attend cultural events or take in professional games in the city of Detroit .
Estonia is a dependent country in the terms of energy and energy production . In recent years many local and foreign companies have been investing in renewable energy sources . [ citation needed ] The importance of wind power has been increasing steadily in Estonia and currently the total amount of energy production from wind is nearly 60 MW while at the same time roughly 399 MW worth of projects are currently being developed and more than 2800 MW worth of projects are being proposed in the Lake Peipus area and the coastal areas of Hiiumaa .
The release of a video-game Starpower : Beyoncé was cancelled after Beyoncé pulled out of a $ 100 million with GateFive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development . It was settled out of court by her lawyers in June 2013 who said that they had cancelled because GateFive had lost its financial backers . Beyoncé also has had deals with American Express , Nintendo DS and L'Oréal since the age of 18 .
New Haven 's best-known geographic features are its large deep harbor , and two reddish basalt trap rock ridges which rise to the northeast and northwest of the city core . These trap rocks are known respectively as East Rock and West Rock , and both serve as extensive parks . West Rock has been tunneled through to make way for the east-west passage of the Wilbur Cross Parkway ( the only highway tunnel through a natural obstacle in Connecticut ) , and once served as the hideout of the " Regicides " ( see : Regicides Trail ) . Most New Haveners refer to these men as " The Three Judges " . East Rock features the prominent Soldiers and Sailors war monument on its peak as well as the " Great/Giant Steps " which run up the rock 's cliffside .
Christian theologians have held idealist views , often based on Neoplatonism , despite the influence of Aristotelian scholasticism from the 12th century onward . Later western theistic idealism such as that of Hermann Lotze offers a theory of the " world ground " in which all things find their unity : it has been widely accepted by Protestant theologians . Several modern religious movements , for example the organizations within the New Thought Movement and the Unity Church , may be said to have a particularly idealist orientation . The theology of Christian Science includes a form of idealism : it teaches that all that truly exists is God and God 's ideas ; that the world as it appears to the senses is a distortion of the underlying spiritual reality , a distortion that may be corrected ( both conceptually and in terms of human experience ) through a reorientation ( spiritualization ) of thought .
There have been modern studies that have supported the original autopsy finding . In a 2008 study , researchers analysed samples of Napoleon 's hair from throughout his life , as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries . All samples had high levels of arsenic , approximately 100 times higher than the current average . According to these researchers , Napoleon 's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy , and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning ; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives . [ note 7 ] Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning , and confirmed evidence of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer as the cause of death .
Since the 2010 election , the government has embarked on a series of reforms to direct the country towards liberal democracy , a mixed economy , and reconciliation , although doubts persist about the motives that underpin such reforms . The series of reforms includes the release of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest , the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission , the granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners , new labour laws that permit labour unions and strikes , a relaxation of press censorship , and the regulation of currency practices .
Interstate 40 crosses the state in a west-east orientation . Its branch interstate highways include I-240 in Memphis ; I-440 in Nashville ; I-140 from Knoxville to Alcoa and I-640 in Knoxville . I-26 , although technically an east-west interstate , runs from the North Carolina border below Johnson City to its terminus at Kingsport . I-24 is an east-west interstate that runs cross-state from Chattanooga to Clarksville . In a north-south orientation are highways I-55 , I-65 , I-75 , and I-81 . Interstate 65 crosses the state through Nashville , while Interstate 75 serves Chattanooga and Knoxville and Interstate 55 serves Memphis . Interstate 81 enters the state at Bristol and terminates at its junction with I-40 near Dandridge . I-155 is a branch highway from I-55 . The only spur highway of I-75 in Tennessee is I-275 , which is in Knoxville . When completed , I-69 will travel through the western part of the state , from South Fulton to Memphis . A branch interstate , I-269 also exists from Millington to Collierville .
In the 14th century , much of the Greek peninsula was lost by the Byzantine Empire at first to the Serbs and then to the Ottomans . By the beginning of the 15th century , the Ottoman advance meant that Byzantine territory in Greece was limited mainly to its then-largest city , Thessaloniki , and the Peloponnese ( Despotate of the Morea ) . After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 , the Morea was the last remnant of the Byzantine Empire to hold out against the Ottomans . However , this , too , fell to the Ottomans in 1460 , completing the Ottoman conquest of mainland Greece . With the Turkish conquest , many Byzantine Greek scholars , who up until then were largely responsible for preserving Classical Greek knowledge , fled to the West , taking with them a large body of literature and thereby significantly contributing to the Renaissance .
The predominant educational psychology from the 1750s onward , especially in northern European countries was associationism , the notion that the mind associates or dissociates ideas through repeated routines . In addition to being conducive to Enlightenment ideologies of liberty , self-determination and personal responsibility , it offered a practical theory of the mind that allowed teachers to transform longstanding forms of print and manuscript culture into effective graphic tools of learning for the lower and middle orders of society . Children were taught to memorize facts through oral and graphic methods that originated during the Renaissance .
The company , which benefited from the imperial patronage , soon expanded its commercial trading operations , eclipsing the Portuguese Estado da Índia , which had established bases in Goa , Chittagong , and Bombay , which Portugal later ceded to England as part of the dowry of Catherine de Braganza . The East India Company also launched a joint attack with the Dutch United East India Company on Portuguese and Spanish ships off the coast of China , which helped secure their ports in China . The company established trading posts in Surat ( 1619 ) , Madras ( 1639 ) , Bombay ( 1668 ) , and Calcutta ( 1690 ) . By 1647 , the company had 23 factories , each under the command of a factor or master merchant and governor if so chosen , and 90 employees in India . The major factories became the walled forts of Fort William in Bengal , Fort St George in Madras , and Bombay Castle .
Predators are often another organism 's prey , and likewise prey are often predators . Though blue jays prey on insects , they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes , and snakes may be the prey of hawks . One way of classifying predators is by trophic level . Organisms that feed on autotrophs , the producers of the trophic pyramid , are known as herbivores or primary consumers ; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers . Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore , but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores , quartary consumers eating them , and so forth . Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level , this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere , and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels , and may go only as high as three trophic levels ( for example , a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest , which in turn eat grasses ) . A predator at the top of any food chain ( that is , one that is preyed upon by no organism ) is called an apex predator ; examples include the orca , sperm whale , anaconda , Komodo dragon , tiger , lion , tiger shark , Nile crocodile , and most eagles and owls—and even omnivorous humans and grizzly bears . An apex predator in one environment may not retain this position as a top predator if introduced to another habitat , such as a dog among alligators , a skunk in the presence of the great horned owl immune to skunk spray , or a snapping turtle among jaguars ; a predatory species introduced into an area where it faces no predators , such as a domestic cat or a dog in some insular environments , can become an apex predator by default .
A substantial number of artists and other figures have been influenced by , or complimented , West 's work , including hip hop artists RZA of Wu-Tang Clan , Chuck D of Public Enemy , and DJ Premier of Gang Starr . Both Drake and Casey Veggies have acknowledged being influenced directly by West . Non-rap artists such as English singer-songwriters Adele and Lily Allen , New Zealand artist Lorde , rock band Arctic Monkeys , pop singer Halsey , Sergio Pizzorno of English rock band Kasabian and American indie rock group MGMT have cited West as an influence . Experimental and electronic artists such as James Blake Daniel Lopatin , and Tim Hecker have also cited West 's work as an inspiration . Experimental rock pioneer and Velvet Underground founder Lou Reed , in a review of West 's album Yeezus , wrote that " the guy really , really , really is talented . He 's really trying to raise the bar . No one 's near doing what he’s doing , it’s not even on the same planet . " Musicians such as Paul McCartney and Prince have also commended West 's work . Famed Tesla Motors CEO and inventor Elon Musk complimented West in a piece for Time Magazine 's 100 most influential people list , writing that :
In a major split in the ranks of Al Qaeda 's organization , the Iraqi franchise , known as Al Qaeda in Iraq covertly invaded Syria and the Levant and began participating in the ongoing Syrian Civil War , gaining enough support and strength to re-invade Iraq 's western provinces under the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIS/ISIL ) , taking over much of the country in a blitzkrieg-like action and combining the Iraq insurgency and Syrian Civil War into a single conflict . Due to their extreme brutality and a complete change in their overall ideology , Al Qaeda 's core organization in Central Asia eventually denounced ISIS and directed their affiliates to cut off all ties with this organization . Many analysts [ who ? ] believe that because of this schism , Al Qaeda and ISIL are now in a competition to retain the title of the world 's most powerful terrorist organization .
In-mid 2015 , China started the build-up of the third generation BeiDou system ( BDS-3 ) in the global coverage constellation . The first BDS-3 satellite was launched 30 September 2015 . As of March 2016 , 4 BDS-3 in-orbit validation satellites have been launched .
In April 2008 , a £90m contract was signed with Boeing for a " quick fix " solution , so they can fly by 2010 : QinetiQ will downgrade the Chinooks—stripping out some of their more advanced equipment .
Howison 's personal idealism was also called " California Personalism " by others to distinguish it from the " Boston Personalism " which was of Bowne . Howison maintained that both impersonal , monistic idealism and materialism run contrary to the experience of moral freedom . To deny freedom to pursue truth , beauty , and " benignant love " is to undermine every profound human venture , including science , morality , and philosophy . Personalistic idealists Borden Parker Bowne and Edgar S. Brightman and realistic personal theist Saint Thomas Aquinas address a core issue , namely that of dependence upon an infinite personal God .
Before the advent of the ASA system , the system of Weston film speed ratings was introduced by Edward Faraday Weston ( 1878–1971 ) and his father Dr. Edward Weston ( 1850–1936 ) , a British-born electrical engineer , industrialist and founder of the US-based Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation , with the Weston model 617 , one of the earliest photo-electric exposure meters , in August 1932 . The meter and film rating system were invented by William Nelson Goodwin , Jr. , who worked for them and later received a Howard N. Potts Medal for his contributions to engineering .
Things were looking grim for Prussia now , with the Austrians mobilising to attack Prussian-controlled soil and a French army under Soubise approaching from the west . However , in November and December of 1757 , the whole situation in Germany was reversed . First , Frederick devastated Prince Soubise 's French force at the Battle of Rossbach on 5 November 1757 and then routed a vastly superior Austrian force at the Battle of Leuthen on 5 December 1757 With these victories , Frederick once again established himself as Europe 's premier general and his men as Europe 's most accomplished soldiers . In spite of this , the Prussians were now facing the prospect of four major powers attacking on four fronts ( France from the West , Austria from the South , Russia from the East and Sweden from the North ) . Meanwhile , a combined force from a number of smaller German states such as Bavaria had been established under Austrian leadership , thus threatening Prussian control of Saxony .
In 1983 , the Antarctic Treaty Parties began negotiations on a convention to regulate mining in Antarctica . A coalition of international organizations launched a public pressure campaign to prevent any minerals development in the region , led largely by Greenpeace International , which established its own scientific station—World Park Base—in the Ross Sea region and conducted annual expeditions to document environmental effects of humans on Antarctica . In 1988 , the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources ( CRAMRA ) was adopted . The following year , however , Australia and France announced that they would not ratify the convention , rendering it dead for all intents and purposes . They proposed instead that a comprehensive regime to protect the Antarctic environment be negotiated in its place . The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty ( the " Madrid Protocol " ) was negotiated as other countries followed suit and on 14 January 1998 it entered into force . The Madrid Protocol bans all mining in Antarctica , designating Antarctica a " natural reserve devoted to peace and science " .
His best known wife was Jovanka Broz . Tito was just shy of his 59th birthday , while she was 27 , when they finally married in April 1952 , with state security chief Aleksandar Ranković as the best man . Their eventual marriage came about somewhat unexpectedly since Tito actually rejected her some years earlier when his confidante Ivan Krajacic brought her in originally . At that time , she was in her early 20s and Tito , objecting to her energetic personality , opted for the more mature opera singer Zinka Kunc instead . Not one to be discouraged easily , Jovanka continued working at Beli Dvor , where she managed the staff and eventually got another chance after Tito 's strange relationship with Zinka failed . Since Jovanka was the only female companion he married while in power , she also went down in history as Yugoslavia 's first lady . Their relationship was not a happy one , however . It had gone through many , often public , ups and downs with episodes of infidelities and even allegations of preparation for a coup d'état by the latter pair . Certain unofficial reports suggest Tito and Jovanka even formally divorced in the late 1970s , shortly before his death . However , during Tito 's funeral she was officially present as his wife , and later claimed rights for inheritance . The couple did not have any children .
In 2012 , New York City had the lowest overall crime rate and the second lowest murder rate among the largest U.S. cities , having become significantly safer after a spike in crime in the 1970s through 1990s . Violent crime in New York City decreased more than 75 % from 1993 to 2005 , and continued decreasing during periods when the nation as a whole saw increases . By 2002 , New York City 's crime rate was similar to that of Provo , Utah , and was ranked 197th in crime among the 216 U.S. cities with populations greater than 100,000 . In 2005 the homicide rate was at its lowest level since 1966 , and in 2007 the city recorded fewer than 500 homicides for the first time ever since crime statistics were first published in 1963 . In the first six months of 2010 , 95.1 % of all murder victims and 95.9 % of all shooting victims in New York City were black or Hispanic ; additionally , 90.2 percent of those arrested for murder and 96.7 percent of those arrested for shooting someone were black or Hispanic . New York experienced a record low of 328 homicides in 2014 and has a far lower murder rate than other major American cities .
Although the ECB is governed by European law directly and thus not by corporate law applying to private law companies , its set-up resembles that of a corporation in the sense that the ECB has shareholders and stock capital . Its capital is five billion euros which is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders . The initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the states ' population and GDP , but the key is adjustable . Shares in the ECB are not transferable and can not be used as collateral .
The new SuperSpeed bus provides a fourth transfer mode with a data signaling rate of 5.0 Gbit/s , in addition to the modes supported by earlier versions . The payload throughput is 4 Gbit/s [ citation needed ] ( due to the overhead incurred by 8b/10b encoding ) , and the specification considers it reasonable to achieve around 3.2 Gbit/s ( 0.4 GB/s or 400 MB/s ) , which should increase with future hardware advances . Communication is full-duplex in SuperSpeed transfer mode ; in the modes supported previously , by 1.x and 2.0 , communication is half-duplex , with direction controlled by the host .
The succeeding Prussian reforms instigated by Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg included the implementation of an Oberlandesgericht appellation court at Königsberg , a municipal corporation , economic freedom as well as emancipation of the serfs and Jews . In the course of the Prussian restoration by the 1815 Congress of Vienna , the East Prussian territories were re-arranged in the Regierungsbezirke of Gumbinnen and Königsberg . From 1905 , the southern districts of East Prussia formed the separate Regierungsbezirk of Allenstein . East and West Prussia were first united in personal union in 1824 , and then merged in a real union in 1829 to form the Province of Prussia . The united province was again split into separate East and West Prussian provinces in 1878 .
A national railway system that extends throughout the country and into Spain , is supported and administered by Comboios de Portugal . Rail transport of passengers and goods is derived using the 2,791 km ( 1,734 mi ) of railway lines currently in service , of which 1,430 km ( 889 mi ) are electrified and about 900 km ( 559 mi ) allow train speeds greater than 120 km/h ( 75 mph ) . The railway network is managed by the REFER while the transport of passengers and goods are the responsibility of Comboios de Portugal ( CP ) , both public companies . In 2006 the CP carried 133 million passengers and 9,750,000 t ( 9,600,000 long tons ; 10,700,000 short tons ) of goods .
The dollar was first based on the value and look of the Spanish dollar , used widely in Spanish America from the 16th to the 19th centuries . The first dollar coins issued by the United States Mint ( founded 1792 ) were similar in size and composition to the Spanish dollar , minted in Mexico and Peru . The Spanish , U.S. silver dollars , and later , Mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the United States , and the Spanish dollar and Mexican peso remained legal tender until the Coinage Act of 1857 . The coinage of various English colonies also circulated . The lion dollar was popular in the Dutch New Netherland Colony ( New York ) , but the lion dollar also circulated throughout the English colonies during the 17th century and early 18th century . Examples circulating in the colonies were usually worn so that the design was not fully distinguishable , thus they were sometimes referred to as " dog dollars " .
The subsequent Slave dynasty of Delhi managed to conquer large areas of northern India , while the Khilji dynasty conquered most of central India but were ultimately unsuccessful in conquering and uniting the subcontinent . The Sultanate ushered in a period of Indian cultural renaissance . The resulting " Indo-Muslim " fusion of cultures left lasting syncretic monuments in architecture , music , literature , religion , and clothing . It is surmised that the language of Urdu ( literally meaning " horde " or " camp " in various Turkic dialects ) was born during the Delhi Sultanate period as a result of the intermingling of the local speakers of Sanskritic Prakrits with immigrants speaking Persian , Turkic , and Arabic under the Muslim rulers . The Delhi Sultanate is the only Indo-Islamic empire to enthrone one of the few female rulers in India , Razia Sultana ( 1236–1240 ) .
Beyoncé 's second solo album B'Day was released on September 5 , 2006 , in the US , to coincide with her twenty-fifth birthday . It sold 541,000 copies in its first week and debuted atop the Billboard 200 , becoming Beyoncé 's second consecutive number-one album in the United States . The album 's lead single " Déjà Vu " , featuring Jay Z , reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . The second international single " Irreplaceable " was a commercial success worldwide , reaching number one in Australia , Hungary , Ireland , New Zealand and the United States . B'Day also produced three other singles ; " Ring the Alarm " , " Get Me Bodied " , and " Green Light " ( released in the United Kingdom only ) .
That said , the score does not provide complete and exact instructions on how to perform a historical work . Even if the tempo is written with an Italian instruction ( e.g. , Allegro ) , we do not know exactly how fast the piece should be played . As well , in the Baroque era , many works that were designed for basso continuo accompaniment do not specify which instruments should play the accompaniment or exactly how the chordal instrument ( harpsichord , lute , etc . ) should play the chords , which are not notated in the part ( only a figured bass symbol beneath the bass part is used to guide the chord-playing performer ) . The performer and/or the conductor have a range of options for musical expression and interpretation of a scored piece , including the phrasing of melodies , the time taken during fermatas ( held notes ) or pauses , and the use ( or choice not to use ) of effects such as vibrato or glissando ( these effects are possible on various stringed , brass and woodwind instruments and with the human voice ) .
Some species of bacteria kill and then consume other microorganisms , these species are called predatory bacteria . These include organisms such as Myxococcus xanthus , which forms swarms of cells that kill and digest any bacteria they encounter . Other bacterial predators either attach to their prey in order to digest them and absorb nutrients , such as Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus , or invade another cell and multiply inside the cytosol , such as Daptobacter . These predatory bacteria are thought to have evolved from saprophages that consumed dead microorganisms , through adaptations that allowed them to entrap and kill other organisms .
The Valencia Cathedral was called Iglesia Mayor in the early days of the Reconquista , then Iglesia de la Seo ( Seo is from the Latin sedes , i.e. , ( archiepiscopal ) See ) , and by virtue of the papal concession of 16 October 1866 , it was called the Basilica Metropolitana . It is situated in the centre of the ancient Roman city where some believe the temple of Diana stood . In Gothic times , it seems to have been dedicated to the Holy Saviour ; the Cid dedicated it to the Blessed Virgin ; King James I of Aragon did likewise , leaving in the main chapel the image of the Blessed Virgin , which he carried with him and is reputed to be the one now preserved in the sacristy . The Moorish mosque , which had been converted into a Christian Church by the conqueror , was deemed unworthy of the title of the cathedral of Valencia , and in 1262 Bishop Andrés de Albalat laid the cornerstone of the new Gothic building , with three naves ; these reach only to the choir of the present building . Bishop Vidal de Blanes built the chapter hall , and James I added the tower , called El Miguelete because it was blessed on St. Michael 's day in 1418 . The tower is about 58 m high and topped with a belfry ( 1660–1736 ) .
Ancient Egypt made significant advances in astronomy , mathematics and medicine . Their development of geometry was a necessary outgrowth of surveying to preserve the layout and ownership of farmland , which was flooded annually by the Nile river . The 3-4-5 right triangle and other rules of thumb were used to build rectilinear structures , and the post and lintel architecture of Egypt . Egypt was also a center of alchemy research for much of the Mediterranean.The Edwin Smith papyrus is one of the first medical documents still extant , and perhaps the earliest document that attempts to describe and analyse the brain : it might be seen as the very beginnings of modern neuroscience . However , while Egyptian medicine had some effective practices , it was not without its ineffective and sometimes harmful practices . Medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology , for example , was largely ineffective . Nevertheless , it applies the following components to the treatment of disease : examination , diagnosis , treatment , and prognosis , which display strong parallels to the basic empirical method of science and according to G. E. R. Lloyd played a significant role in the development of this methodology . The Ebers papyrus ( c. 1550 BC ) also contains evidence of traditional empiricism .
Spielberg and actor Tom Cruise collaborated for the first time for the futuristic neo-noir Minority Report , based upon the science fiction short story written by Philip K. Dick about a Washington D.C. police captain in the year 2054 who has been foreseen to murder a man he has not yet met . The film received strong reviews with the review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes giving it a 92 % approval rating , reporting that 206 out of the 225 reviews they tallied were positive . The film earned over $ 358 million worldwide . Roger Ebert , who named it the best film of 2002 , praised its breathtaking vision of the future as well as for the way Spielberg blended CGI with live-action .
The English word scientist is relatively recent—first coined by William Whewell in the 19th century . Previously , people investigating nature called themselves natural philosophers . While empirical investigations of the natural world have been described since classical antiquity ( for example , by Thales , Aristotle , and others ) , and scientific methods have been employed since the Middle Ages ( for example , by Ibn al-Haytham , and Roger Bacon ) , the dawn of modern science is often traced back to the early modern period and in particular to the scientific revolution that took place in 16th- and 17th-century Europe . Scientific methods are considered to be so fundamental to modern science that some consider earlier inquiries into nature to be pre-scientific . Traditionally , historians of science have defined science sufficiently broadly to include those inquiries .
Asked about the liberal , non-democratic rule by a Chilean interviewer , Hayek is translated from German to Spanish to English as having said , " As long term institutions , I am totally against dictatorships . But a dictatorship may be a necessary system for a transitional period . [ ... ] Personally I prefer a liberal dictatorship to democratic government devoid of liberalism . My personal impression – and this is valid for South America – is that in Chile , for example , we will witness a transition from a dictatorial government to a liberal government . " In a letter to the London Times , he defended the Pinochet regime and said that he had " not been able to find a single person even in much maligned Chile who did not agree that personal freedom was much greater under Pinochet than it had been under Allende . " Hayek admitted that " it is not very likely that this will succeed , even if , at a particular point in time , it may be the only hope there is . " , he explained , however , " It is not certain hope , because it will always depend on the goodwill of an individual , and there are very few individuals one can trust . But if it is the sole opportunity which exists at a particular moment it may be the best solution despite this . And only if and when the dictatorial government is visibly directing its steps towards limited democracy " .
Sarvastivada teachings—which were criticized by Nāgārjuna—were reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asanga and were adapted into the Yogacara school . While the Mādhyamaka school held that asserting the existence or non-existence of any ultimately real thing was inappropriate , some exponents of Yogacara asserted that the mind and only the mind is ultimately real ( a doctrine known as cittamatra ) . Not all Yogacarins asserted that mind was truly existent ; Vasubandhu and Asanga in particular did not . [ web 11 ] These two schools of thought , in opposition or synthesis , form the basis of subsequent Mahayana metaphysics in the Indo-Tibetan tradition .
Documentary filmmakers have studied the lives of wrestlers and the effects the profession has on them and their families . The 1999 theatrical documentary Beyond the Mat focused on Terry Funk , a wrestler nearing retirement ; Mick Foley , a wrestler within his prime ; Jake Roberts , a former star fallen from grace ; and a school of wrestling student trying to break into the business . The 2005 release Lipstick and Dynamite , Piss and Vinegar : The First Ladies of Wrestling chronicled the development of women 's wrestling throughout the 20th century . Pro wrestling has been featured several times on HBO 's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel . MTV 's documentary series True Life featured two episodes titled " I 'm a Professional Wrestler " and " I Want to Be a Professional Wrestler " . Other documentaries have been produced by The Learning Channel ( The Secret World of Professional Wrestling ) and A & E ( Hitman Hart : Wrestling with Shadows ) . Bloodstained Memoirs explored the careers of several pro wrestlers , including Chris Jericho , Rob Van Dam and Roddy Piper .
The use of lossy compression is designed to greatly reduce the amount of data required to represent the audio recording and still sound like a faithful reproduction of the original uncompressed audio for most listeners . An MP3 file that is created using the setting of 128 kbit/s will result in a file that is about 1/11 the size of the CD file created from the original audio source ( 44,100 samples per second × 16 bits per sample × 2 channels = 1,411,200 bit/s ; MP3 compressed at 128 kbit/s : 128,000 bit/s [ 1 k = 1,000 , not 1024 , because it is a bit rate ] . Ratio : 1,411,200/128,000 = 11.025 ) . An MP3 file can also be constructed at higher or lower bit rates , with higher or lower resulting quality .
From the years 1500 to 1850 , an estimated 3.5 million captives were forcibly shipped from West/Central Africa to Brazil ; the territory received the highest number of slaves of any country in the Americas . Scholars estimate that more than half of the Brazilian population is at least in part descended from these individuals . Brazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants outside of Africa . In contrast to the US , during the slavery period and after , the Portuguese colonial government and later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti-miscegenation or segregation laws . As in other Latin countries , intermarriage was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward . In addition , people of mixed race ( pardo ) often tended to marry white , and their descendants became accepted as white . As a result , some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood . According to the last census of the 20th century , in which Brazilians could choose from five color/ethnic categories with which they identified , 54 % of individuals identified as white , 6.2 % identified as black , and 39.5 % identified as pardo ( brown ) — a broad multi-racial category , including tri-racial persons .
David Archuleta 's performance of John Lennon 's " Imagine " was considered by many as one of the best of the season . Jennifer Lopez , who was brought in as a judge in season ten , called it a beautiful song-moment that she will never forget . Jason Castro 's semi-final performance of " Hallelujah " also received considerable attention , and it propelled Jeff Buckley 's version of the song to the top of the Billboard digital song chart . This was the first season in which contestants ' recordings were released onto iTunes after their performances , and although sales information was not released so as not to prejudice the contest , leaked information indicated that contestants ' songs frequently reached the top of iTunes sales charts .
Such a theory would be true with higher probability , because it can not be attacked so easily : to falsify the first one , it is sufficient to find that the sun has stopped rising ; to falsify the second one , one additionally needs the assumption that the given day has not yet been reached . Popper held that it is the least likely , or most easily falsifiable , or simplest theory ( attributes which he identified as all the same thing ) that explains known facts that one should rationally prefer . His opposition to positivism , which held that it is the theory most likely to be true that one should prefer , here becomes very apparent . It is impossible , Popper argues , to ensure a theory to be true ; it is more important that its falsity can be detected as easily as possible .
The pointed arch , one of the defining attributes of Gothic , was earlier incorporated into Islamic architecture following the Islamic conquests of Roman Syria and the Sassanid Empire in the Seventh Century . The pointed arch and its precursors had been employed in Late Roman and Sassanian architecture ; within the Roman context , evidenced in early church building in Syria and occasional secular structures , like the Roman Karamagara Bridge ; in Sassanid architecture , in the parabolic and pointed arches employed in palace and sacred construction .
Much of the medieval period was a time of power struggles between competing dynasties such as the House of Savoy , the Visconti in northern Italy and the House of Habsburg in Austria and Slovenia . In 1291 to protect themselves from incursions by the Habsburgs , four cantons in the middle of Switzerland drew up a charter that is considered to be a declaration of independence from neighboring kingdoms . After a series of battles fought in the 13th , 14th and 15th centuries , more cantons joined the confederacy and by the 16th century Switzerland was well-established as a separate state .
During the 19th century , an important producer of art was the Academia de San Carlos ( San Carlos Art Academy ) , founded during colonial times , and which later became the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas ( the National School of Arts ) including painting , sculpture and graphic design , one of UNAM 's art schools . Many of the works produced by the students and faculty of that time are now displayed in the Museo Nacional de San Carlos ( National Museum of San Carlos ) . One of the students , José María Velasco , is considered one of the greatest Mexican landscape painters of the 19th century . Porfirio Díaz 's regime sponsored arts , especially those that followed the French school . Popular arts in the form of cartoons and illustrations flourished , e.g . those of José Guadalupe Posada and Manuel Manilla . The permanent collection of the San Carlos Museum also includes paintings by European masters such as Rembrandt , Velázquez , Murillo , and Rubens .
Composers of classical music have often made use of folk music ( music created by musicians who are commonly not classically trained , often from a purely oral tradition ) . Some composers , like Dvořák and Smetana , have used folk themes to impart a nationalist flavor to their work , while others like Bartók have used specific themes lifted whole from their folk-music origins .
On 6 February 2015 , it was announced that Judge Richard Marks is to be replaced by Judge Charles Wide at the retrial . Two days earlier , Marks had emailed counsel for the defendants telling them : " It has been decided ( not by me but by my elders and betters ) that I am not going to be doing the retrial " . Reporting the decision in UK newspaper The Guardian , Lisa O’Carroll wrote : " Wide is the only judge so far to have presided in a case which has seen a conviction of a journalist in relation to allegations of unlawful payments to public officials for stories . The journalist , who can not be named for legal reasons , is appealing the verdict " . Defence counsel for the four journalists threatened to take the decision to judicial review , with the barrister representing Pharo , Nigel Rumfitt QC , saying : " The way this has come about gives rise to the impression that something has been going on behind the scenes which should not have been going on behind the scenes and which should have been dealt with transparently " . He added that the defendants were " extremely concerned " and " entitled " to know why Marks was being replaced by Wide .
After losing an extra-inning game in Game 1 , the Cubs rallied and took a 3 games to 1 lead over the Wild Card Florida Marlins in the NLCS . Florida shut the Cubs out in Game 5 , but young pitcher Mark Prior led the Cubs in Game 6 as they took a 3–0 lead into the 8th inning and it was at this point when a now-infamous incident took place . Several spectators attempted to catch a foul ball off the bat of Luis Castillo . A Chicago Cubs fan by the name of Steve Bartman , of Northbrook , Illinois , reached for the ball and deflected it away from the glove of Moisés Alou for the second out of the 8th inning . Alou reacted angrily toward the stands , and after the game stated that he would have caught the ball . Alou at one point recanted , saying he would not have been able to make the play , but later said this was just an attempt to make Bartman feel better and believing the whole incident should be forgotten . Interference was not called on the play , as the ball was ruled to be on the spectator side of the wall . Castillo was eventually walked by Prior . Two batters later , and to the chagrin of the packed stadium , Cubs shortstop Alex Gonzalez misplayed an inning ending double play , loading the bases and leading to eight Florida runs and a Marlin victory . Despite sending Kerry Wood to the mound and holding a lead twice , the Cubs ultimately dropped Game 7 , and failed to reach the World Series .
At the end of the 1980s , Estonians perceived their demographic change as a national catastrophe . This was a result of the migration policies essential to the Soviet Nationalisation Programme aiming to russify Estonia – administrative and military immigration of non-Estonians from the USSR coupled with the deportation of Estonians to the USSR . In the decade following the reconstitution of independence , large-scale emigration by ethnic Russians and the removal of the Russian military bases in 1994 caused the proportion of ethnic Estonians in Estonia to increase from 61 % to 69 % in 2006 .
What industries children work in depends on if they grew up in a rural area or an urban area . Children who were born in urban areas often found themselves working for street vendors , washing cars , helping in construction sites , weaving clothing , and sometimes even working as exotic dancers . While children who grew up in rural areas would work on farms doing physical labour , working with animals , and selling crops . Of all the child workers , the most serious cases involved street children and trafficked children due to the physical and emotional abuse they endured by their employers . To address the issue of child labour , the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child Act was implemented in 1959 . Yet due to poverty , lack of education and ignorance , the legal actions were not/are not wholly enforced or accepted in Africa .
The inclusiveness of Weinreich 's definition ( above ) directs attention to the totality of one 's identity at a given phase in time , and assists in elucidating component aspects of one 's total identity , such as one 's gender identity , ethnic identity , occupational identity and so on . The definition readily applies to the young child , to the adolescent , to the young adult , and to the older adult in various phases of the life cycle . Depending on whether one is a young child or an adult at the height of one 's powers , how one construes oneself as one was in the past will refer to very different salient experiential markers . Likewise , how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future will differ considerably according to one 's age and accumulated experiences . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , ( eds ) 2003 , pp 26–34 ) .
The original post-punk movement ended as the bands associated with the movement turned away from its aesthetics , often in favor of more commercial sounds . Many of these groups would continue recording as part of the new pop movement , with entryism becoming a popular concept . In the United States , driven by MTV and modern rock radio stations , a number of post-punk acts had an influence on or became part of the Second British Invasion of " New Music " there . Some shifted to a more commercial new wave sound ( such as Gang of Four ) , while others were fixtures on American college radio and became early examples of alternative rock . Perhaps the most successful band to emerge from post-punk was U2 , who combined elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music .
Israel 's Supreme Court is at the head of the court system in the State of Israel . It is the highest judicial instance . The Supreme Court sits in Jerusalem . The area of its jurisdiction is the entire State . A ruling of the Supreme Court is binding upon every court , other than the Supreme Court itself . The Israeli supreme court is both an appellate court and the high court of justice . As an appellate court , the Supreme Court considers cases on appeal ( both criminal and civil ) on judgments and other decisions of the District Courts . It also considers appeals on judicial and quasi-judicial decisions of various kinds , such as matters relating to the legality of Knesset elections and disciplinary rulings of the Bar Association . As the High Court of Justice ( Hebrew : Beit Mishpat Gavoha Le'Zedek בית משפט גבוה לצדק ; also known by its initials as Bagatz בג " ץ ) , the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance , primarily in matters regarding the legality of decisions of State authorities : Government decisions , those of local authorities and other bodies and persons performing public functions under the law , and direct challenges to the constitutionality of laws enacted by the Knesset . The court has broad discretionary authority to rule on matters in which it considers it necessary to grant relief in the interests of justice , and which are not within the jurisdiction of another court or tribunal . The High Court of Justice grants relief through orders such as injunction , mandamus and Habeas Corpus , as well as through declaratory judgments . The Supreme Court can also sit at a further hearing on its own judgment . In a matter on which the Supreme Court has ruled - whether as a court of appeals or as the High Court of Justice - with a panel of three or more justices , it may rule at a further hearing with a panel of a larger number of justices . A further hearing may be held if the Supreme Court makes a ruling inconsistent with a previous ruling or if the Court deems that the importance , difficulty or novelty of a ruling of the Court justifies such hearing . The Supreme Court also holds the unique power of being able to order " trial de novo " ( a retrial ) .
In October 1997 , Nintendo released a redesigned model of the SNES ( the SNS-101 model ) in North America for US $ 99 , which sometimes included the pack-in game Super Mario World 2 : Yoshi 's Island . Like the earlier redesign of the NES ( the NES-101 model ) , the new model was slimmer and lighter than its predecessor , but it lacked S-Video and RGB output , and it was among the last major SNES-related releases in the region . A similarly redesigned Super Famicom Jr. was released in Japan at around the same time .
In 1830 , the Duchess of Kent and Conroy took Victoria across the centre of England to visit the Malvern Hills , stopping at towns and great country houses along the way . Similar journeys to other parts of England and Wales were taken in 1832 , 1833 , 1834 and 1835 . To the King 's annoyance , Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops . William compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heiress presumptive . Victoria disliked the trips ; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill , and there was little time for her to rest . She objected on the grounds of the King 's disapproval , but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy , and forced Victoria to continue the tours . At Ramsgate in October 1835 , Victoria contracted a severe fever , which Conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence . While Victoria was ill , Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary . As a teenager , Victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and Conroy to appoint him to her staff . Once queen , she banned him from her presence , but he remained in her mother 's household .
The term Hokkien ( 福建 ; hɔk˥˥kɪɛn˨˩ ) is itself a term not used in Chinese to refer to the dialect , as it simply means Fujian province . In Chinese linguistics , these dialects are known by their classification under the Quanzhang Division ( Chinese : 泉漳片 ; pinyin : Quánzhāng piàn ) of Min Nan , which comes from the first characters of the two main Hokkien urban centers Quanzhou and Zhangzhou . The variety is also known by other terms such as the more general Min Nan ( traditional Chinese : 閩南語 , 閩南話 ; simplified Chinese : 闽南语 , 闽南话 ; pinyin : Mǐnnányǔ , Mǐnnánhuà ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : Bân-lâm-gí , Bân-lâm-oē ) or Southern Min , and Fulaohua ( traditional Chinese : 福佬話 ; simplified Chinese : 福佬话 ; pinyin : Fúlǎohuà ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : Hō-ló-oē ) . The term Hokkien ( Chinese : 福建話 ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : hok-kiàn oē ; Tâi-lô : Hok-kiàn-uē ) , on the other hand , is used commonly in South East Asia to refer to Min-nan dialects .
In an interview that Popper gave in 1969 with the condition that it shall be kept secret until after his death , he summarised his position on God as follows : " I do n't know whether God exists or not . ... Some forms of atheism are arrogant and ignorant and should be rejected , but agnosticism—to admit that we do n't know and to search—is all right . ... When I look at what I call the gift of life , I feel a gratitude which is in tune with some religious ideas of God . However , the moment I even speak of it , I am embarrassed that I may do something wrong to God in talking about God . " He objected to organised religion , saying " it tends to use the name of God in vain " , noting the danger of fanaticism because of religious conflicts : " The whole thing goes back to myths which , though they may have a kernel of truth , are untrue . Why then should the Jewish myth be true and the Indian and Egyptian myths not be true ? " In a letter unrelated to the interview , he stressed his tolerant attitude : " Although I am not for religion , I do think that we should show respect for anybody who believes honestly . "
Sirri Amer was close to King Farouk , and was nominated for the presidency of the Officer 's Club—normally a ceremonial office—with the king 's backing . Nasser was determined to establish the independence of the army from the monarchy , and with Amer as the intercessor , resolved to field a nominee for the Free Officers . They selected Muhammad Naguib , a popular general who had offered his resignation to Farouk in 1942 over British high-handedness and was wounded three times in the Palestine War . Naguib won overwhelmingly and the Free Officers , through their connection with a leading Egyptian daily , al-Misri , publicized his victory while praising the nationalistic spirit of the army .
The Bovington signal course 's director reported that Gaddafi successfully overcame problems learning English , displaying a firm command of voice procedure . Noting that Gaddafi 's favourite hobbies were reading and playing football , he thought him an " amusing officer , always cheerful , hard-working , and conscientious . " Gaddafi disliked England , claiming British Army officers racially insulted him and finding it difficult adjusting to the country 's culture ; asserting his Arab identity in London , he walked around Piccadilly wearing traditional Libyan robes . He later related that while he travelled to England believing it more advanced than Libya , he returned home " more confident and proud of our values , ideals and social character . "
A Federal Trade Commission report issued in 1958 attempted to quantify the effect of antibiotic development on American public health . The report found that over the period 1946-1955 , there was a 42 % drop in the incidence of diseases for which antibiotics were effective and only a 20 % drop in those for which antibiotics were not effective . The report concluded that " it appears that the use of antibiotics , early diagnosis , and other factors have limited the epidemic spread and thus the number of these diseases which have occurred " . The study further examined mortality rates for eight common diseases for which antibiotics offered effective therapy ( syphilis , tuberculosis , dysentery , scarlet fever , whooping cough , meningococcal infections , and pneumonia ) , and found a 56 % decline over the same period . Notable among these was a 75 % decline in deaths due to tuberculosis .
People of Irish descent form the largest single ethnic group in the city , making up 15.8 % of the population , followed by Italians , accounting for 8.3 % of the population . People of West Indian and Caribbean ancestry are another sizable group , at 6.0 % , about half of whom are of Haitian ancestry . Over 27,000 Chinese Americans made their home in Boston city proper in 2013 , and the city hosts a growing Chinatown accommodating heavily traveled Chinese-owned bus lines to and from Chinatown , Manhattan . Some neighborhoods , such as Dorchester , have received an influx of people of Vietnamese ancestry in recent decades . Neighborhoods such as Jamaica Plain and Roslindale have experienced a growing number of Dominican Americans . The city and greater area also has a growing immigrant population of South Asians , including the tenth-largest Indian community in the country .
The evolutionary relationships and heredity of a group of organisms is called its phylogeny . Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies . The basic approach is to use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine relationships . As an example , species of Pereskia are trees or bushes with prominent leaves . They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless cactus such as an Echinocactus . However , both Pereskia and Echinocactus have spines produced from areoles ( highly specialised pad-like structures ) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related .
On the shores of the strait , in 1701 , the French officer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac , along with fifty-one French people and French Canadians , founded a settlement called Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit , naming it after Louis Phélypeaux , comte de Pontchartrain , Minister of Marine under Louis XIV . France offered free land to colonists to attract families to Detroit ; when it reached a total population of 800 in 1765 , it was the largest city between Montreal and New Orleans , both also French settlements . By 1773 , the population of Detroit was 1,400 . By 1778 , its population was up to 2,144 and it was the third-largest city in the Province of Quebec .
Modern interpretations see this period as a civil war between Hellenized and orthodox forms of Judaism . Out of this revolt was formed an independent Jewish kingdom known as the Hasmonaean Dynasty , which lasted from 165 BCE to 63 BCE . The Hasmonean Dynasty eventually disintegrated in a civil war , which coincided with civil wars in Rome . The last Hasmonean ruler , Antigonus II Mattathias , was captured by Herod and executed in 37 BCE . In spite of originally being a revolt against Greek overlordship , the Hasmonean kingdom and also the Herodian kingdom which followed gradually became more and more hellenized . From 37 BCE to 6 CE , the Herodian dynasty , Jewish-Roman client kings , ruled Judea . Herod the Great considerably enlarged the Temple ( see Herod 's Temple ) , making it one of the largest religious structures in the world . The style of the enlarged temple and other Herodian architecture shows significant Hellenistic architectural influence .
Another term for Christians which appears in the New Testament is " Nazarenes " which is used by the Jewish lawyer Tertullus in Acts 24 . Tertullian ( Against Marcion 4:8 ) records that " the Jews call us Nazarenes , " while around 331 AD Eusebius records that Christ was called a Nazoraean from the name Nazareth , and that in earlier centuries " Christians , " were once called " Nazarenes . " The Hebrew equivalent of " Nazarenes " , Notzrim , occurs in the Babylonian Talmud , and is still the modern Israeli Hebrew term for Christian .
Port Phillip is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and/or the land mass , particularly in spring and autumn ; this can set up a " bay effect " similar to the " lake effect " seen in colder climates where showers are intensified leeward of the bay . Relatively narrow streams of heavy showers can often affect the same places ( usually the eastern suburbs ) for an extended period , while the rest of Melbourne and surrounds stays dry . Overall , Melbourne is , owing to the rain shadow of the Otway Ranges , nonetheless drier than average for southern Victoria . Within the city and surrounds , however , rainfall varies widely , from around 425 millimetres ( 17 in ) at Little River to 1,250 millimetres ( 49 in ) on the eastern fringe at Gembrook . Melbourne receives 48.6 clear days annually . Dewpoint temperatures in the summer range from 9.5 °C ( 49.1 °F ) to 11.7 °C ( 53.1 °F ) .
There is little consensus on the precise beginning of the Age of Enlightenment ; the beginning of the 18th century ( 1701 ) or the middle of the 17th century ( 1650 ) are often used as epochs . French historians usually place the period , called the Siècle des Lumières ( Century of Enlightenments ) , between 1715 and 1789 , from the beginning of the reign of Louis XV until the French Revolution . If taken back to the mid-17th century , the Enlightenment would trace its origins to Descartes ' Discourse on Method , published in 1637 . In France , many cited the publication of Isaac Newton 's Principia Mathematica in 1687 . It is argued by several historians and philosophers that the beginning of the Enlightenment is when Descartes shifted the epistemological basis from external authority to internal certainty by his cogito ergo sum published in 1637 . As to its end , most scholars use the last years of the century , often choosing the French Revolution of 1789 or the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars ( 1804–15 ) as a convenient point in time with which to date the end of the Enlightenment .
The Somerset Levels ( or Somerset Levels and Moors as they are less commonly but more correctly known ) are a sparsely populated wetland area of central Somerset , between the Quantock and Mendip hills . They consist of marine clay levels along the coast , and the inland ( often peat based ) moors . The Levels are divided into two by the Polden Hills ; land to the south is drained by the River Parrett while land to the north is drained by the River Axe and the River Brue . The total area of the Levels amounts to about 647.5 square kilometres ( 160,000 acres ) and broadly corresponds to the administrative district of Sedgemoor but also includes the south west of Mendip district . Approximately 70 % of the area is grassland and 30 % is arable . Stretching about 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) inland , this expanse of flat land barely rises above sea level . Before it was drained , much of the land was under a shallow brackish sea in winter and was marsh land in summer . Drainage began with the Romans , and was restarted at various times : by the Anglo-Saxons ; in the Middle Ages by the Glastonbury Abbey , from 1400–1770 ; and during the Second World War , with the construction of the Huntspill River . Pumping and management of water levels still continues .
The first favours a primordialist approach which takes the sense of self and belonging to a collective group as a fixed thing , defined by objective criteria such as common ancestry and common biological characteristics . The second , rooted in social constructionist theory , takes the view that identity is formed by a predominantly political choice of certain characteristics . In so doing , it questions the idea that identity is a natural given , characterised by fixed , supposedly objective criteria . Both approaches need to be understood in their respective political and historical contexts , characterised by debate on issues of class , race and ethnicity . While they have been criticized , they continue to exert an influence on approaches to the conceptualisation of identity today .
The black-body problem was revisited in 1905 , when Rayleigh and Jeans ( on the one hand ) and Einstein ( on the other hand ) independently proved that classical electromagnetism could never account for the observed spectrum . These proofs are commonly known as the " ultraviolet catastrophe " , a name coined by Paul Ehrenfest in 1911 . They contributed greatly ( along with Einstein 's work on the photoelectric effect ) to convincing physicists that Planck 's postulate of quantized energy levels was more than a mere mathematical formalism . The very first Solvay Conference in 1911 was devoted to " the theory of radiation and quanta " . Max Planck received the 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics " in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta " .
Romanesque architecture in Germany , Poland , the Czech Lands and Austria is characterised by its massive and modular nature . This is expressed in the Gothic architecture of Central Europe in the huge size of the towers and spires , often projected , but not always completed . The west front generally follows the French formula , but the towers are very much taller and , if complete , are surmounted by enormous openwork spires that are a regional feature . Because of the size of the towers , the section of the façade between them may appear narrow and compressed . The eastern end follows the French form . The distinctive character of the interior of German Gothic cathedrals is their breadth and openness . This is the case even when , as at Cologne , they have been modelled upon a French cathedral . German cathedrals , like the French , tend not to have strongly projecting transepts . There are also many hall churches ( Hallenkirchen ) without clerestory windows .
During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period of China ( 907–960 ) , while the fractured political realm of China saw no threat in a Tibet which was in just as much political disarray , there was little in the way of Sino-Tibetan relations . Few documents involving Sino-Tibetan contacts survive from the Song dynasty ( 960–1279 ) . The Song were far more concerned with countering northern enemy states of the Khitan-ruled Liao dynasty ( 907–1125 ) and Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty ( 1115–1234 ) .
The changes brought about by these developments have led many scholars to view this period as the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of modern history and early modern Europe . However , the division is somewhat artificial , since ancient learning was never entirely absent from European society . As a result there was developmental continuity between the ancient age ( via classical antiquity ) and the modern age . Some historians , particularly in Italy , prefer not to speak of the late Middle Ages at all , but rather see the high period of the Middle Ages transitioning to the Renaissance and the modern era .
As a Republican , he was first elected on October 7 , 2003 , in a special recall election to replace then-Governor Gray Davis . Schwarzenegger was sworn in on November 17 , to serve the remainder of Davis 's term . Schwarzenegger was then re-elected on November 7 , 2006 , in California 's 2006 gubernatorial election , to serve a full term as governor , defeating Democrat Phil Angelides , who was California State Treasurer at the time . Schwarzenegger was sworn in for his second term on January 5 , 2007 . In 2011 , Schwarzenegger completed his second term as governor .
The race was the most expensive for Congress in the country that year and four days before the general election , Durkin withdrew and endorsed Cronin , hoping to see Kerry defeated . The week before , a poll had put Kerry 10 points ahead of Cronin , with Dukin on 13 % . In the final days of the campaign , Kerry sensed that it was " slipping away " and Cronin emerged victorious by 110,970 votes ( 53.45 % ) to Kerry 's 92,847 ( 44.72 % ) . After his defeat , Kerry lamented in a letter to supporters that " for two solid weeks , [ The Sun ] called me un-American , New Left antiwar agitator , unpatriotic , and labeled me every other 'un- ' and 'anti- ' that they could find . It 's hard to believe that one newspaper could be so powerful , but they were . " He later felt that his failure to respond directly to The Sun 's attacks cost him the race .
In 1785 , the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York the national capital shortly after the war . New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States . In 1789 , the first President of the United States , George Washington , was inaugurated ; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time , and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted , all at Federal Hall on Wall Street . By 1790 , New York had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States .
North Carolina became one of the English Thirteen Colonies and with the territory of South Carolina was originally known as the Province of Carolina . The northern and southern parts of the original province separated in 1729 . Originally settled by small farmers , sometimes having a few slaves , who were oriented toward subsistence agriculture , the colony lacked cities or towns . Pirates menaced the coastal settlements , but by 1718 the pirates had been captured and killed . Growth was strong in the middle of the 18th century , as the economy attracted Scots-Irish , Quaker , English and German immigrants . The colonists generally supported the American Revolution , as the number of Loyalists was smaller than in some other colonies .
In the next two years , the company established its first factory in south India in the town of Machilipatnam on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal . The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted King James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England . But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period , including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years .
Most types of capacitor include a dielectric spacer , which increases their capacitance . These dielectrics are most often insulators . However , low capacitance devices are available with a vacuum between their plates , which allows extremely high voltage operation and low losses . Variable capacitors with their plates open to the atmosphere were commonly used in radio tuning circuits . Later designs use polymer foil dielectric between the moving and stationary plates , with no significant air space between them .
As with the minerals discussed above , some vitamins are recognized as organic essential nutrients , necessary in the diet for good health . ( Vitamin D is the exception : it can be synthesized in the skin , in the presence of UVB radiation . ) Certain vitamin-like compounds that are recommended in the diet , such as carnitine , are thought useful for survival and health , but these are not " essential " dietary nutrients because the human body has some capacity to produce them from other compounds . Moreover , thousands of different phytochemicals have recently been discovered in food ( particularly in fresh vegetables ) , which may have desirable properties including antioxidant activity ( see below ) ; however , experimental demonstration has been suggestive but inconclusive . Other essential nutrients that are not classified as vitamins include essential amino acids ( see above ) , choline , essential fatty acids ( see above ) , and the minerals discussed in the preceding section .
Non-Australian citizens who are Australian permanent residents should be aware that during their stay on Norfolk Island they are " outside of Australia " for the purposes of the Migration Act . This means that not only will they need a still-valid migrant visa or Resident return visa to return from Norfolk Island to the mainland , but also the time spent in Norfolk Island will not be counted for satisfying the residence requirement for obtaining a Resident return visa in the future . On the other hand , as far as Australian nationality law is concerned , Norfolk Island is a part of Australia , and any time spent by an Australian permanent resident on Norfolk Island will count as time spent in Australia for the purpose of applying for Australian citizenship .
Perhaps the first electric motors were simple electrostatic devices created by the Scottish monk Andrew Gordon in the 1740s . The theoretical principle behind production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field , Ampère 's force law , was discovered later by André-Marie Ampère in 1820 . The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by electromagnetic means was demonstrated by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1821 . A free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury , on which a permanent magnet ( PM ) was placed . When a current was passed through the wire , the wire rotated around the magnet , showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire . This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments , brine substituting for toxic mercury . Though Barlow 's wheel was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration , these and similar homopolar motors were to remain unsuited to practical application until late in the century .
Melbourne is often referred to as Australia 's garden city , and the state of Victoria was once known as the garden state . There is an abundance of parks and gardens in Melbourne , many close to the CBD with a variety of common and rare plant species amid landscaped vistas , pedestrian pathways and tree-lined avenues . Melbourne 's parks are often considered the best public parks in all of Australia 's major cities . There are also many parks in the surrounding suburbs of Melbourne , such as in the municipalities of Stonnington , Boroondara and Port Phillip , south east of the central business district . The extensive area covered by urban Melbourne is formally divided into hundreds of suburbs ( for addressing and postal purposes ) , and administered as local government areas 31 of which are located within the metropolitan area .
Emotion , in everyday speech , is any relatively brief conscious experience characterized by intense mental activity and a high degree of pleasure or displeasure . Scientific discourse has drifted to other meanings and there is no consensus on a definition . Emotion is often intertwined with mood , temperament , personality , disposition , and motivation . In some theories , cognition is an important aspect of emotion . Those acting primarily on emotion may seem as if they are not thinking , but mental processes are still essential , particularly in the interpretation of events . For example , the realization of danger and subsequent arousal of the nervous system ( e.g . rapid heartbeat and breathing , sweating , muscle tension ) is integral to the experience of fear . Other theories , however , claim that emotion is separate from and can precede cognition .
TCM 's film content has remained mostly uncut and uncolorized ( with films natively filmed or post-produced in the format being those only ones presented in color ) , depending upon the original content of movies , particularly movies released after the 1968 implementation of the Motion Picture Association of America 's ratings system and the concurrent disestablishment of the Motion Picture Production Code . Because of this , TCM is formatted similarly to a premium channel with certain films – particularly those made from the 1960s onward – sometimes featuring nudity , sexual content , violence and/or strong profanity ; the network also features rating bumpers prior to the start of a program ( most programs on TCM , especially films , are rated for content using the TV Parental Guidelines , in lieu of the MPAA 's rating system ) .
Dell was listed at number 51 in the Fortune 500 list , until 2014 . After going private in 2013 , the newly confidential nature of its financial information prevents the company from being ranked by Fortune . In 2014 it was the third largest PC vendor in the world after Lenovo and HP . Dell is currently the # 1 shipper of PC monitors in the world . Dell is the sixth largest company in Texas by total revenue , according to Fortune magazine . It is the second largest non-oil company in Texas – behind AT & T – and the largest company in the Greater Austin area . It was a publicly traded company ( NASDAQ : DELL ) , as well as a component of the NASDAQ-100 and S & P 500 , until it was taken private in a leveraged buyout which closed on October 30 , 2013 .
During April , Fourteenth Army advanced 300 miles ( 480 km ) south towards Rangoon , the capital and principal port of Burma , but was delayed by Japanese rearguards 40 miles ( 64 km ) north of Rangoon at the end of the month . Slim feared that the Japanese would defend Rangoon house-to-house during the monsoon , placing his army in a disastrous supply situation , and in March he had asked that a plan to capture Rangoon by an amphibious force , Operation Dracula , which had been abandoned earlier , be reinstated . Dracula was launched on 1 May , but Rangoon was found to have been abandoned . The troops which occupied Rangoon linked up with Fourteenth Army five days later , securing the Allies ' lines of communication .
The nature of government under the Angevin monarchs was ill-defined and uncertain . John 's predecessors had ruled using the principle of vis et voluntas , or " force and will " , taking executive and sometimes arbitrary decisions , often justified on the basis that a king was above the law . Both Henry II and Richard had argued that kings possessed a quality of " divine majesty " ; John continued this trend and claimed an " almost imperial status " for himself as ruler . During the 12th century , there were contrary opinions expressed about the nature of kingship , and many contemporary writers believed that monarchs should rule in accordance with the custom and the law , and take counsel of the leading members of the realm . There was as yet no model for what should happen if a king refused to do so . Despite his claim to unique authority within England , John would sometimes justify his actions on the basis that he had taken council with the barons . Modern historians remain divided as to whether John suffered from a case of " royal schizophrenia " in his approach to government , or if his actions merely reflected the complex model of Angevin kingship in the early 13th century .
Beyoncé and husband Jay Z are friends with President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama . She performed " America the Beautiful " at the 2009 presidential inauguration , as well as " At Last " during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later . Beyoncé and Jay Z held a fundraiser at the latter 's 40/40 Club in Manhattan for Obama 's 2012 presidential campaign which raised $ 4 million . Beyoncé uploaded pictures of her paper ballot on Tumblr , confirming she had voted in support for the Democratic Party and to encourage others to do so . She also performed the American national anthem at his second inauguration , singing along with a pre-recorded track . She publicly endorsed same sex marriage on March 26 , 2013 , after the Supreme Court debate on California 's Proposition 8 . In July 2013 , Beyoncé and Jay-Z attended a rally in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting of Trayvon Martin .
In 1903 , Josiah White III bought a parcel of land near Ohio Avenue and the boardwalk and built the Queen Anne style Marlborough House . The hotel was a hit and , in 1905–06 , he chose to expand the hotel and bought another parcel of land next door to his Marlborough House . In an effort to make his new hotel a source of conversation , White hired the architectural firm of Price and McLanahan . The firm made use of reinforced concrete , a new building material invented by Jean-Louis Lambot in 1848 ( Joseph Monier received the patent in 1867 ) . The hotel 's Spanish and Moorish themes , capped off with its signature dome and chimneys , represented a step forward from other hotels that had a classically designed influence . White named the new hotel the Blenheim and merged the two hotels into the Marlborough-Blenheim . Bally 's Atlantic City was later constructed at this location .
Season six premiered with the series ' highest-rated debut episode and a few of its succeeding episodes rank among the most watched episodes of American Idol . During this time , many television executives begun to regard the show as a programming force unlike any seen before , as its consistent dominance of up to two hours two or three nights a week exceeded the 30- or 60-minute reach of previous hits such as NBC 's The Cosby Show . The show was dubbed " the Death Star " , and competing networks often rearranged their schedules in order to minimize losses . However , season six also showed a steady decline in viewership over the course of the season . The season finale saw a drop in ratings of 16 % from the previous year . Season six was the first season wherein the average results show rated higher than the competition stages ( unlike in the previous seasons ) , and became the second highest-rated of the series after the preceding season .
The Rajpath which was built similar to the Champs-Élysées in Paris is the ceremonial boulevard for the Republic of India located in New Delhi . The annual Republic Day parade takes place here on 26 January .
American Idol is an American singing competition series created by Simon Fuller and produced by 19 Entertainment , and is distributed by FremantleMedia North America . It began airing on Fox on June 11 , 2002 , as an addition to the Idols format based on the British series Pop Idol and has since become one of the most successful shows in the history of American television . The concept of the series is to find new solo recording artists , with the winner being determined by the viewers in America . Winners chosen by viewers through telephone , Internet , and SMS text voting were Kelly Clarkson , Ruben Studdard , Fantasia Barrino , Carrie Underwood , Taylor Hicks , Jordin Sparks , David Cook , Kris Allen , Lee DeWyze , Scotty McCreery , Phillip Phillips , Candice Glover , Caleb Johnson , and Nick Fradiani .
At the start of her reign Victoria was popular , but her reputation suffered in an 1839 court intrigue when one of her mother 's ladies-in-waiting , Lady Flora Hastings , developed an abdominal growth that was widely rumoured to be an out-of-wedlock pregnancy by Sir John Conroy . Victoria believed the rumours . She hated Conroy , and despised " that odious Lady Flora " , because she had conspired with Conroy and the Duchess of Kent in the Kensington System . At first , Lady Flora refused to submit to a naked medical examination , until in mid-February she eventually agreed , and was found to be a virgin . Conroy , the Hastings family and the opposition Tories organised a press campaign implicating the Queen in the spreading of false rumours about Lady Flora . When Lady Flora died in July , the post-mortem revealed a large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen . At public appearances , Victoria was hissed and jeered as " Mrs. Melbourne " .
Administratively , Portugal is divided into 308 municipalities ( Portuguese : municípios or concelhos ) , which after a reform in 2013 are subdivided into 3,092 civil parishes ( Portuguese : freguesia ) . Operationally , the municipality and civil parish , along with the national government , are the only legally identifiable local administrative units identified by the government of Portugal ( for example , cities , towns or villages have no standing in law , although may be used as catchment for the defining services ) . For statistical purposes the Portuguese government also identifies NUTS , inter-municipal communities and informally , the district system , used until European integration ( and being phased-out by the national government ) . [ original research ? ] Continental Portugal is agglomerated into 18 districts , while the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are governed as autonomous regions ; the largest units , established since 1976 , are either mainland Portugal ( Portuguese : Portugal Continental ) and the autonomous regions of Portugal ( Azores and Madeira ) .
Another popular argument for affirmative action is the compensation argument . Blacks were mistreated in the past for a morally irrelevant characteristic of being black so society today should compensate for the injuries . This causes reverse discrimination in the form of preferential hirings , contracts , and scholarships as a means to ameliorate past wrongs . Many opponents argue that this form of reparation is morally indefensible because if blacks were harmed for being black in the past , then preferential treatment for this same trait is illogical . In addition , arguments are made that whites today who innocently benefited from past injustices should not be punished for something they had no control over . Therefore , they are being reverse discriminated against because they are receiving the punishment that should be given to people who willingly and knowingly benefited from discriminatory practices
Over the years , the Mughals began to have internal disputes which greatly distracted them at times . The Mughal Empire continued to weaken , and with the decline of the Mughal Empire in the 18th century , Rajputana came under the suzerainty of the Marathas . The Marathas , who were Hindus from the state of what is now Maharashtra , ruled Rajputana for most of the eighteenth century . The Maratha Empire , which had replaced the Mughal Empire as the overlord of the subcontinent , was finally replaced by the British Empire in 1818 .
Cockfighting is said to be the world 's oldest spectator sport and may have originated in Persia 6,000 years ago . Two mature males ( cocks or roosters ) are set to fight each other , and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed . Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour . The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians , Chinese , Greeks , and Romans , and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter . Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of cruelty to animals .
Although the same basic components are present in all vertebrate brains , some branches of vertebrate evolution have led to substantial distortions of brain geometry , especially in the forebrain area . The brain of a shark shows the basic components in a straightforward way , but in teleost fishes ( the great majority of existing fish species ) , the forebrain has become " everted " , like a sock turned inside out . In birds , there are also major changes in forebrain structure . These distortions can make it difficult to match brain components from one species with those of another species .
Glacial moraines are formed by the deposition of material from a glacier and are exposed after the glacier has retreated . They usually appear as linear mounds of till , a non-sorted mixture of rock , gravel and boulders within a matrix of a fine powdery material . Terminal or end moraines are formed at the foot or terminal end of a glacier . Lateral moraines are formed on the sides of the glacier . Medial moraines are formed when two different glaciers merge and the lateral moraines of each coalesce to form a moraine in the middle of the combined glacier . Less apparent are ground moraines , also called glacial drift , which often blankets the surface underneath the glacier downslope from the equilibrium line .
The city remained in the hands of Christian troops until 1102 , when the Almoravids retook the city and restored the Muslim religion . Although the self-styled 'Emperor of All Spain ' , Alfonso VI of León and Castile , drove them from the city , he was not strong enough to hold it . The Christians set it afire before abandoning it , and the Almoravid Masdali took possession on 5 May 1109 . The event was commemorated in a poem by Ibn Khafaja in which he thanked Yusuf ibn Tashfin for the city 's liberation.The declining power of the Almoravids coincided with the rise of a new dynasty in North Africa , the Almohads , who seized control of the peninsula from the year 1145 , although their entry into Valencia was deterred by Ibn Mardanis , King of Valencia and Murcia until 1171 , at which time the city finally fell to the North Africans . The two Muslim dynasties would rule Valencia for more than a century .
The United Nations formulates multiple regional divisions as is convenient for its various operations . But few of them include a Near East , and that poorly defined . UNICEF recognizes the " Middle East and North Africa " region , where the Middle East is bounded by the Red Sea on the west and includes Iran on the east . UNESCO recognizes neither a Near East nor a Middle East , dividing the countries instead among three regions : Arab States , Asia and the Pacific , and Africa . Its division " does not forcibly reflect geography " but " refers to the execution of regional activities . " The United Nations Statistics Division defines Western Asia to contain the countries included elsewhere in the Middle East . The Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) describes its entire theatre of operations as the Near East , but then assigns many of its members to other regions as well ; for example , Cyprus , Malta and Turkey are in both the European and the Near Eastern regions . Its total area extends further into Central Asia than that of most agencies .
In recent years [ when ? ] , there have been reports of child abuse in St Helena . Britain’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) has been accused of lying to the United Nations about child abuse in St Helena to cover up allegations , including cases of a police officer having raped a four-year-old girl and of a police officer having mutilated a two-year-old .
Different phases of digestion take place including : the cephalic phase , gastric phase , and intestinal phase . The cephalic phase occurs at the sight , thought and smell of food , which stimulate the cerebral cortex . Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata . After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine . Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40 % of maximum rate . Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal ( secretes acid ) and G cell ( secretes gastrin ) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin . The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours . It is stimulated by distension of the stomach , presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH . Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes . This activates the release of acetylcholine , which stimulates the release of more gastric juices . As protein enters the stomach , it binds to hydrogen ions , which raises the pH of the stomach . Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted . This triggers G cells to release gastrin , which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid . Gastric acid is about 0.5 % hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) , which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3 . Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine . The intestinal phase has two parts , the excitatory and the inhibitory . Partially digested food fills the duodenum . This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released . Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei , activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering , and inhibits local reflexes .
The origins of the szlachta are shrouded in obscurity and mystery and have been the subject of a variety of theories . :207 Traditionally , its members were owners of landed property , often in the form of " manor farms " or so-called folwarks . The nobility negotiated substantial and increasing political and legal privileges for itself throughout its entire history until the decline of the Polish Commonwealth in the late 18th century .
Some multiracial individuals feel marginalized by U.S. society . For example , when applying to schools or for a job , or when taking standardized tests , Americans are sometimes asked to check boxes corresponding to race or ethnicity . Typically , about five race choices are given , with the instruction to " check only one . " While some surveys offer an " other " box , this choice groups together individuals of many different multiracial types ( ex : European Americans/African-Americans are grouped with Asian/Native American Indians ) .
During the tumultuous 14th century , disputes within the leadership of the Church led to the Avignon Papacy of 1305–78 , also called the " Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy " ( a reference to the Babylonian captivity of the Jews ) , and then to the Great Schism , lasting from 1378 to 1418 , when there were two and later three rival popes , each supported by several states . Ecclesiastical officials convened at the Council of Constance in 1414 , and in the following year the council deposed one of the rival popes , leaving only two claimants . Further depositions followed , and in November 1417 the council elected Martin V ( pope 1417–31 ) as pope .
The Arctic tern holds the long-distance migration record for birds , travelling between Arctic breeding grounds and the Antarctic each year . Some species of tubenoses ( Procellariiformes ) such as albatrosses circle the earth , flying over the southern oceans , while others such as Manx shearwaters migrate 14,000 km ( 8,700 mi ) between their northern breeding grounds and the southern ocean . Shorter migrations are common , including altitudinal migrations on mountains such as the Andes and Himalayas .
Twins ( 1988 ) , a comedy with Danny DeVito , also proved successful . Total Recall ( 1990 ) netted Schwarzenegger $ 10 million and 15 % of the film 's gross . A science fiction script , the film was based on the Philip K. Dick short story " We Can Remember It for You Wholesale " . Kindergarten Cop ( 1990 ) reunited him with director Ivan Reitman , who directed him in Twins . Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing , first with a 1990 episode of the TV series Tales from the Crypt , entitled " The Switch " , and then with the 1992 telemovie Christmas in Connecticut . He has not directed since .
At present , the full name of the government of Nanjing is " People 's Government of Nanjing City " and the city is under the one-party rule of the CPC , with the CPC Nanjing Committee Secretary as the de facto governor of the city and the mayor as the executive head of the government working under the secretary .
In 1982 , the band released the album Hot Space , a departure from their trademark seventies sound , this time being a mixture of rock , pop rock , dance , funk , and R & B . Most of the album was recorded in Munich during the most turbulent period in the band 's history , and Taylor and May lamented the new sound , with both being very critical of the influence Mercury 's personal manager Paul Prenter had on the singer . May was also scathing of Prenter , who was Mercury 's manager from the early 1980s to 1984 , for being dismissive of the importance of radio stations , such as the US networks , and their vital connection between the artist and the community , and for denying them access to Mercury . The band stopped touring North America after their Hot Space Tour , as their success there had waned , although they would perform on American television for the only time during the eighth season premiere of Saturday Night Live . Queen left Elektra Records , their label in the United States , Canada , Japan , Australia , and New Zealand , and signed onto EMI/Capitol Records .
The original post-punk movement ended as the bands associated with the movement turned away from its aesthetics , often in favor of more commercial sounds . Many of these groups would continue recording as part of the new pop movement , with entryism becoming a popular concept . In the United States , driven by MTV and modern rock radio stations , a number of post-punk acts had an influence on or became part of the Second British Invasion of " New Music " there . Some shifted to a more commercial new wave sound ( such as Gang of Four ) , while others were fixtures on American college radio and became early examples of alternative rock . Perhaps the most successful band to emerge from post-punk was U2 , who combined elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music .
Tuberculosis has been present in humans since antiquity . The earliest unambiguous detection of M. tuberculosis involves evidence of the disease in the remains of bison in Wyoming dated to around 17,000 years ago . However , whether tuberculosis originated in bovines , then was transferred to humans , or whether it diverged from a common ancestor , is currently unclear . A comparison of the genes of M. tuberculosis complex ( MTBC ) in humans to MTBC in animals suggests humans did not acquire MTBC from animals during animal domestication , as was previously believed . Both strains of the tuberculosis bacteria share a common ancestor , which could have infected humans as early as the Neolithic Revolution .
Israel is one of the world 's technological leaders in water technology . In 2011 , its water technology industry was worth around $ 2 billion a year with annual exports of products and services in the tens of millions of dollars . The ongoing shortage of water in the country has spurred innovation in water conservation techniques , and a substantial agricultural modernization , drip irrigation , was invented in Israel . Israel is also at the technological forefront of desalination and water recycling . The Ashkelon seawater reverse osmosis ( SWRO ) plant , the largest in the world , was voted 'Desalination Plant of the Year ' in the Global Water Awards in 2006 . Israel hosts an annual Water Technology Exhibition and Conference ( WaTec ) that attracts thousands of people from across the world . By 2014 , Israel 's desalination programs provided roughly 35 % of Israel 's drinking water and it is expected to supply 40 % by 2015 and 70 % by 2050 . As of May 29 , 2015 more than 50 percent of the water for Israeli households , agriculture and industry is artificially produced . As a result of innovations in reverse osmosis technology , Israel is set to become a net exporter of water in the coming years .
With nearly a third of Bostonians using public transit for their commute to work , Boston has the fifth-highest rate of public transit usage in the country . Boston 's subway system , the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ( MBTA—known as the " T " ) operates the oldest underground rapid transit system in the Americas , and is the fourth-busiest rapid transit system in the country , with 65.5 miles ( 105 km ) of track on four lines . The MBTA also operates busy bus and commuter rail networks , and water shuttles .
Others argue that the rule of law has survived but was transformed to allow for the exercise of discretion by administrators . For much of American history , the dominant notion of the rule of law , in this setting , has been some version of A. V. Dicey 's : “no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary Courts of the land.” That is , individuals should be able to challenge an administrative order by bringing suit in a court of general jurisdiction . As the dockets of worker compensation commissions , public utility commissions and other agencies burgeoned , it soon became apparent that letting judges decide for themselves all the facts in a dispute ( such as the extent of an injury in a worker 's compensation case ) would overwhelm the courts and destroy the advantages of specialization that led to the creation of administrative agencies in the first place . Even Charles Evans Hughes , a Chief Justice of the United States , believed “you must have administration , and you must have administration by administrative officers.” By 1941 , a compromise had emerged . If administrators adopted procedures that more-or-less tracked " the ordinary legal manner " of the courts , further review of the facts by " the ordinary Courts of the land " was unnecessary . That is , if you had your " day in commission , " the rule of law did not require a further " day in court . " Thus Dicey 's rule of law was recast into a purely procedural form .
1855 : Kars : In the year up to May 1855 Turkish forces in the east were reduced from 120,000 to 75,000 , mostly by disease . The local Armenian population kept Muravyev well-informed about the Turks at Kars and he judged they had about five months of supplies . He therefore decided to control the surrounding area with cavalry and starve them out . He started in May and by June was south and west of the town . A relieving force fell back and there was a possibility of taking Erzerum , but Muravyev chose not to . In late September he learned of the fall of Sevastopol and a Turkish landing at Batum . This led him to reverse policy and try a direct attack . It failed , the Russians losing 8000 men and the Turks 1500 ( 29 September ) . The blockade continued and Kars surrendered on 8 November .
Ibn Sīnā wrote at least one treatise on alchemy , but several others have been falsely attributed to him . His Logic , Metaphysics , Physics , and De Caelo , are treatises giving a synoptic view of Aristotelian doctrine , though Metaphysics demonstrates a significant departure from the brand of Neoplatonism known as Aristotelianism in Ibn Sīnā 's world ; Arabic philosophers [ who ? ] [ year needed ] have hinted at the idea that Ibn Sīnā was attempting to " re-Aristotelianise " Muslim philosophy in its entirety , unlike his predecessors , who accepted the conflation of Platonic , Aristotelian , Neo- and Middle-Platonic works transmitted into the Muslim world .
According to Y chromosome studies by Sanchez et al . ( 2005 ) , Cruciani et al . ( 2004 , 2007 ) , the Somalis are paternally closely related to other Afro-Asiatic-speaking groups in Northeast Africa . Besides comprising the majority of the Y-DNA in Somalis , the E1b1b1a ( formerly E3b1a ) haplogroup also makes up a significant proportion of the paternal DNA of Ethiopians , Sudanese , Egyptians , Berbers , North African Arabs , as well as many Mediterranean populations . Sanchez et al . ( 2005 ) observed the M78 subclade of E1b1b in about 77 % of their Somali male samples . According to Cruciani et al . ( 2007 ) , the presence of this subhaplogroup in the Horn region may represent the traces of an ancient migration from Egypt/Libya . After haplogroup E1b1b , the second most frequently occurring Y-DNA haplogroup among Somalis is the West Asian haplogroup T ( M70 ) . It is observed in slightly more than 10 % of Somali males . Haplogroup T , like haplogroup E1b1b , is also typically found among populations of Northeast Africa , North Africa , the Near East and the Mediterranean .
In 1938 Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission with radiochemical methods , and in 1939 Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch wrote the first theoretical interpretation of the fission process , which was later improved by Niels Bohr and John A. Wheeler . Further developments took place during World War II , which led to the practical application of radar and the development and use of the atomic bomb . Though the process had begun with the invention of the cyclotron by Ernest O. Lawrence in the 1930s , physics in the postwar period entered into a phase of what historians have called " Big Science " , requiring massive machines , budgets , and laboratories in order to test their theories and move into new frontiers . The primary patron of physics became state governments , who recognized that the support of " basic " research could often lead to technologies useful to both military and industrial applications . Currently , general relativity and quantum mechanics are inconsistent with each other , and efforts are underway to unify the two .
It seems an oracular cult existed in Delphi from the Mycenaean ages . In historical times , the priests of Delphi were called Labryaden , " the double-axe men " , which indicates Minoan origin . The double-axe , labrys , was the holy symbol of the Cretan labyrinth . The Homeric hymn adds that Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi , where they evidently transferred their religious practices . Apollo Delphinios was a sea-god especially worshiped in Crete and in the islands , and his name indicates his connection with Delphi and the holy serpent Delphyne ( " womb " ) . [ citation needed ] Apollo 's sister Artemis , who was the Greek goddess of hunting , is identified with Britomartis ( Diktynna ) , the Minoan " Mistress of the animals " . In her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the " Mister of the animals " , a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute . His original name is unknown , but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular Apollo , who stood by the virgin " Mistress of the Animals " , becoming her brother .
However , even if UTC is used internally , the systems still require information on time zones to correctly calculate local time where it is needed . Many systems in use today base their date/time calculations from data derived from the IANA time zone database also known as zoneinfo .
The standard SNES controller adds two additional face buttons ( X and Y ) to the design of the NES iteration , arranging the four in a diamond shape , and introduces two shoulder buttons . It also features an ergonomic design by Lance Barr , later used for the NES-102 model controllers , also designed by Barr . The Japanese and PAL region versions incorporate the colors of the four action buttons into system 's logo . The North American version 's buttons are colored to match the redesigned console ; the X and Y buttons are lavender with concave faces , and the A and B buttons are purple with convex faces . Several later consoles derive elements of their controller design from the SNES , including the PlayStation , Dreamcast , Xbox , and Wii Classic Controller .
Although Whig grandees such as Portland and Fitzwilliam privately agreed with Burke 's Appeal , they wished he had used more moderate language . Fitzwilliam saw the Appeal as containing " the doctrines I have sworn by , long and long since " . Francis Basset , a backbench Whig MP , wrote to Burke : " ... though for reasons which I will not now detail I did not then deliver my sentiments , I most perfectly differ from Mr. Fox & from the great Body of opposition on the French Revolution " . Burke sent a copy of the Appeal to the king and the king requested a friend to communicate to Burke that he had read it " with great Satisfaction " . Burke wrote of its reception : " Not one word from one of our party . They are secretly galled . They agree with me to a title ; but they dare not speak out for fear of hurting Fox . ... They leave me to myself ; they see that I can do myself justice " . Charles Burney viewed it as " a most admirable book—the best & most useful on political subjects that I have ever seen " but believed the differences in the Whig Party between Burke and Fox should not be aired publicly .
Victoria later described her childhood as " rather melancholy " . Her mother was extremely protective , and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called " Kensington System " , an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller , Sir John Conroy , who was rumoured to be the Duchess 's lover . The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable ( including most of her father 's family ) , and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them . The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William 's bastard children , and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety . Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night , studied with private tutors to a regular timetable , and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel , Dash . Her lessons included French , German , Italian , and Latin , but she spoke only English at home .
The most common forms of uranium oxide are triuranium octoxide ( U 3O 8 ) and UO 2 . Both oxide forms are solids that have low solubility in water and are relatively stable over a wide range of environmental conditions . Triuranium octoxide is ( depending on conditions ) the most stable compound of uranium and is the form most commonly found in nature . Uranium dioxide is the form in which uranium is most commonly used as a nuclear reactor fuel . At ambient temperatures , UO 2 will gradually convert to U 3O 8 . Because of their stability , uranium oxides are generally considered the preferred chemical form for storage or disposal .
The Seahawks ' CenturyLink Field has hosted NFL playoff games in 2006 , 2008 , 2011 , 2014 and 2015 . The Seahawks have advanced to the Super Bowl three times : 2005 , 2013 and 2014 . They defeated the Denver Broncos 43-8 to win their first Super Bowl championship in Super Bowl XLVIII , but lost 24-28 against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX . Seattle Sounders FC has played in Major League Soccer since 2009 , sharing CenturyLink Field with the Seahawks , as a continuation of earlier teams in the lower divisions of American soccer . The Sounders have not won the MLS Cup but have , however , won the MLS Supporters ' Shield in 2014 and the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup on four occasions : 2009 , 2010 , 2011 , and 2014 .
The Tucson Padres played at Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium from 2011 to 2013 . They served as the AAA affiliate of the San Diego Padres . The team , formerly known as the Portland Beavers , was temporarily relocated to Tucson from Portland while awaiting the building of a new stadium in Escondido . Legal issues derailed the plans to build the Escondido stadium , so they moved to El Paso , Texas for the 2014 season . Previously , the Tucson Sidewinders , a triple-A affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks , won the Pacific Coast League championship and unofficial AAA championship in 2006 . The Sidewinders played in Tucson Electric Park and were in the Pacific Conference South of the PCL . The Sidewinders were sold in 2007 and moved to Reno , Nevada after the 2008 season . They now compete as the Reno Aces .

Much research has been conducted on the psychological ramifications of body image on adolescents . Modern day teenagers are exposed to more media on a daily basis than any generation before them . Recent studies have indicated that the average teenager watches roughly 1500 hours of television per year . As such , modern day adolescents are exposed to many representations of ideal , societal beauty . The concept of a person being unhappy with their own image or appearance has been defined as " body dissatisfaction " . In teenagers , body dissatisfaction is often associated with body mass , low self-esteem , and atypical eating patterns . Scholars continue to debate the effects of media on body dissatisfaction in teens .
There are many lodges and reserves to accommodate eco-tourists . Sport hunting is also a large , and growing component of the Namibian economy , accounting for 14 % of total tourism in the year 2000 , or $ 19.6 million US dollars , with Namibia boasting numerous species sought after by international sport hunters . In addition , extreme sports such as sandboarding , skydiving and 4x4ing have become popular , and many cities have companies that provide tours . [ citation needed ] The most visited places include the capital city of Windhoek , Caprivi Strip , Fish River Canyon , Sossusvlei , the Skeleton Coast Park , Sesriem , Etosha Pan and the coastal towns of Swakopmund , Walvis Bay and Lüderitz .
The lands of Galicia are ascribed to two different areas in the Köppen climate classification : a south area ( roughly , the province of Ourense and Pontevedra ) with tendencies to have some summer drought , classified as a warm-summer Mediterranean climate ( Csb ) , with mild temperatures and rainfall usual throughout the year ; and the western and northern coastal regions , the provinces of Lugo and A Coruña , which are characterized by their Oceanic climate ( Cfb ) , with a more uniform precipitation distribution along the year , and milder summers . However , precipitation in southern coastal areas are often classified as oceanic since the averages remain significantly higher than a typical mediterranean climate .
The standard connectors were designed to be robust . Because USB is hot-pluggable , the connectors would be used more frequently , and perhaps with less care , than other connectors . Many previous connector designs were fragile , specifying embedded component pins or other delicate parts that were vulnerable to bending or breaking . The electrical contacts in a USB connector are protected by an adjacent plastic tongue , and the entire connecting assembly is usually protected by an enclosing metal sheath .
In India , Carnival is celebrated only in the state of Goa and a Roman Catholic tradition , where it is known as Intruz which means swindler while Entrudo , the appropriate word in Portuguese for Carnival . The largest celebration takes place in the city of Panjim which was part of Velha Conquista , Goa , but now is celebrate throughout the state . The tradition was introduced by the Portuguese who ruled Goa for over four centuries . On Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday , the European Tradition of Fat Tuesday is celebrated with the partaking of eating of crepes also called as " AleBelle . " The crepes are filled with freshly grated coconut and heat condensed coconut sap that sequentially converts it into a brown sweet molasses and additional heat concentration solidifies it to jaggery . The celebrations of Carnival peak for three days and nights and precede Ash Wednesday . When the legendary King Momo takes over the state . All-night parades occur throughout the state with bands , dances and floats and grand balls are held in the evenings .
Electric instruments such as the electric guitar , the electric bass and the ondes Martenot appear occasionally in the classical music of the 20th and 21st centuries . Both classical and popular musicians have experimented in recent decades with electronic instruments such as the synthesizer , electric and digital techniques such as the use of sampled or computer-generated sounds , and instruments from other cultures such as the gamelan .

Tracks include Tucson Raceway Park and Rillito Downs . Tucson Raceway Park hosts NASCAR-sanctioned auto racing events and is one of only two asphalt short tracks in Arizona . Rillito Downs is an in-town destination on weekends in January and February each year . This historic track held the first organized quarter horse races in the world , and they are still racing there . The racetrack is threatened by development . The Moltacqua racetrack , was another historic horse racetrack located on what is now Sabino Canyon Road and Vactor Ranch Trail , but it no longer exists .
The University of St Mark & St John ( known as " Marjon " or " Marjons " ) specialises in teacher training , and offers training across the country and abroad .
Mikhail Gorbachev was elected General Secretary by the Politburo on March 11 , 1985 , three hours after predecessor Konstantin Chernenko 's death at age 73 . Gorbachev , aged 54 , was the youngest member of the Politburo . His initial goal as general secretary was to revive the Soviet economy , and he realized that doing so would require reforming underlying political and social structures . The reforms began with personnel changes of senior Brezhnev-era officials who would impede political and economic change . On April 23 , 1985 , Gorbachev brought two protégés , Yegor Ligachev and Nikolai Ryzhkov , into the Politburo as full members . He kept the " power " ministries happy by promoting KGB Head Viktor Chebrikov from candidate to full member and appointing Minister of Defence Marshal Sergei Sokolov as a Politburo candidate .
As the century wore on , the factions slowly began to adopt more coherent political tendencies as the interests of their power bases began to diverge . The Whig party 's initial base of support from the great aristocratic families , widened to include the emerging industrial interests and wealthy merchants . As well as championing constitutional monarchy with strict limits on the monarch 's power , the Whigs adamantly opposed a Catholic king as a threat to liberty , and believed in extending toleration to nonconformist Protestants , or dissenters . A major influence on the Whigs were the liberal political ideas of John Locke , and the concepts of universal rights employed by Locke and Algernon Sidney .
Notable Greek seafarers include people such as Pytheas of Marseilles , Scylax of Caryanda who sailed to Iberia and beyond , Nearchus , the 6th century merchant and later monk Cosmas Indicopleustes ( Cosmas who sailed to India ) and the explorer of the Northwestern passage Juan de Fuca . In later times , the Romioi plied the sea-lanes of the Mediterranean and controlled trade until an embargo imposed by the Roman Emperor on trade with the Caliphate opened the door for the later Italian pre-eminence in trade .
Pain is usually transitory , lasting only until the noxious stimulus is removed or the underlying damage or pathology has healed , but some painful conditions , such as rheumatoid arthritis , peripheral neuropathy , cancer and idiopathic pain , may persist for years . Pain that lasts a long time is called chronic or persistent , and pain that resolves quickly is called acute . Traditionally , the distinction between acute and chronic pain has relied upon an arbitrary interval of time from onset ; the two most commonly used markers being 3 months and 6 months since the onset of pain , though some theorists and researchers have placed the transition from acute to chronic pain at 12 months . :93 Others apply acute to pain that lasts less than 30 days , chronic to pain of more than six months ' duration , and subacute to pain that lasts from one to six months . A popular alternative definition of chronic pain , involving no arbitrarily fixed durations , is " pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing " . Chronic pain may be classified as cancer pain or else as benign .
In practice , because of sovereignty , any state can withdraw from any treaty at any time . The question of whether this is permitted is really a question of how other states will react to the withdrawal ; for instance , another state might impose sanctions or go to war over a treaty violation .
In September 1940 the first Alsatian resistance movement led by Marcel Weinum called La main noire ( The black hand ) was created . It was composed by a group of 25 young men aged from 14 to 18 years old who led several attacks against the German occupation . The actions culminated with the attack of the Gauleiter Robert Wagner , the highest commander of Alsace directly under the order of Hitler . In March 1942 , Marcel Weinum was prosecuted by the Gestapo and sentenced to be beheaded at the age of 18 in April 1942 in Stuttgart , Germany . His last words will be : " If I have to die , I shall die but with a pure heart " . From 1943 the city was bombarded by Allied aircraft . While the First World War had not notably damaged the city , Anglo-American bombing caused extensive destruction in raids of which at least one was allegedly carried out by mistake . In August 1944 , several buildings in the Old Town were damaged by bombs , particularly the Palais Rohan , the Old Customs House ( Ancienne Douane ) and the Cathedral . On 23 November 1944 , the city was officially liberated by the 2nd French Armoured Division under General Leclerc . He achieved the oath that he made with his soldiers , after the decisive Capture of Kufra . With the Oath of Kuffra , they swore to keep up the fight until the French flag flew over the Cathedral of Strasbourg .
Other influential Muslim philosophers include al-Jahiz , a pioneer in evolutionary thought ; Ibn al-Haytham ( Alhazen ) , a pioneer of phenomenology and the philosophy of science and a critic of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Aristotle 's concept of place ( topos ) ; Al-Biruni , a critic of Aristotelian natural philosophy ; Ibn Tufail and Ibn al-Nafis , pioneers of the philosophical novel ; Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi , founder of Illuminationist philosophy ; Fakhr al-Din al-Razi , a critic of Aristotelian logic and a pioneer of inductive logic ; and Ibn Khaldun , a pioneer in the philosophy of history .
The effects of some types of mold on infection had been noticed many times over the course of history ( see : History of penicillin ) . In 1928 , Alexander Fleming noticed the same effect in a Petri dish , where a number of disease-causing bacteria were killed by a fungus of the genus Penicillium . Fleming postulated that the effect is mediated by an antibacterial compound he named penicillin , and that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy . He initially characterized some of its biological properties , and attempted to use a crude preparation to treat some infections , but he was unable to pursue its further development without the aid of trained chemists .
The latest study using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to humans and dogs together proved that dogs have same response to voices and use the same parts of the brain as humans to do so . This gives dogs the ability to recognize emotional human sounds , making them friendly social pets to humans .
Rufinus relates a story that as Bishop Alexander stood by a window , he watched boys playing on the seashore below , imitating the ritual of Christian baptism . He sent for the children and discovered that one of the boys ( Athanasius ) had acted as bishop . After questioning Athanasius , Bishop Alexander informed him that the baptisms were genuine , as both the form and matter of the sacrament had been performed through the recitation of the correct words and the administration of water , and that he must not continue to do this as those baptized had not been properly catechized . He invited Athanasius and his playfellows to prepare for clerical careers .
The London Underground in England is one of the few networks that uses a four-rail system . The additional rail carries the electrical return that , on third rail and overhead networks , is provided by the running rails . On the London Underground , a top-contact third rail is beside the track , energized at +420v DC , and a top-contact fourth rail is located centrally between the running rails at −210v DC , which combine to provide a traction voltage of 630v DC . London Underground is now upgrading its fourth rail system to 750v DC with a positive conductor rail energised to +500v DC and a negative conductor rail energised to -250v DC . However , many older sections in tunnels are still energised to 630v DC . The same system was used for Milan 's earliest underground line , Milan Metro 's line 1 , whose more recent lines use an overhead catenary or a third rail .
Though the true dimensions of species diversity remain uncertain , estimates range from 2.6–7.8 million species with a mean of 5.5 million . This probably represents less than 20 % of all species on Earth [ citation needed ] , and with only about 20,000 new species of all organisms being described each year , most species likely will remain undescribed for many years unless species descriptions increase in rate . About 850,000–1,000,000 of all described species are insects . Of the 24 orders of insects , four dominate in terms of numbers of described species , with at least 3 million species included in Coleoptera , Diptera , Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera . A recent study estimated the number of beetles at 0.9–2.1 million with a mean of 1.5 million .
The Supermarine Spitfire was designed and developed in Southampton , evolving from the Schneider trophy-winning seaplanes of the 1920s and 1930s . Its designer , R J Mitchell , lived in the Portswood area of Southampton , and his house is today marked with a blue plaque . Heavy bombing of the factory in September 1940 destroyed it as well as homes in the vicinity , killing civilians and workers . World War II hit Southampton particularly hard because of its strategic importance as a major commercial port and industrial area . Prior to the Invasion of Europe , components for a Mulberry harbour were built here . After D-Day , Southampton docks handled military cargo to help keep the Allied forces supplied , making it a key target of Luftwaffe bombing raids until late 1944 . Southampton docks was featured in the television show 24 : Live Another Day in Day 9 : 9:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m .
Ibn Sīnā wrote extensively on early Islamic philosophy , especially the subjects logic , ethics , and metaphysics , including treatises named Logic and Metaphysics . Most of his works were written in Arabic – then the language of science in the Middle East – and some in Persian . Of linguistic significance even to this day are a few books that he wrote in nearly pure Persian language ( particularly the Danishnamah-yi 'Ala ' , Philosophy for Ala ' ad-Dawla ' ) . Ibn Sīnā 's commentaries on Aristotle often criticized the philosopher , [ citation needed ] encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of ijtihad .
At low frequencies ( such as AM broadcast ) , arrays of vertical towers are used to achieve directionality and they will occupy large areas of land . For reception , a long Beverage antenna can have significant directivity . For non directional portable use , a short vertical antenna or small loop antenna works well , with the main design challenge being that of impedance matching . With a vertical antenna a loading coil at the base of the antenna may be employed to cancel the reactive component of impedance ; small loop antennas are tuned with parallel capacitors for this purpose .
In addition , Mahayana Buddhists believe there are innumerable other Buddhas in other universes . A Theravada commentary says that Buddhas arise one at a time in this world element , and not at all in others . The understandings of this matter reflect widely differing interpretations of basic terms , such as " world realm " , between the various schools of Buddhism .
The company is often criticized by both the media and its own staff for its less upstanding policies regarding employee relations . A 2012 Reddit post written by an anonymous Comcast call center employee eager to share their negative experiences with the public received attention from publications including The Huffington Post . A 2014 investigative series published by The Verge involved interviews with 150 of Comcast 's employees . It sought to examine why the company has become so widely criticized by its customers , the media and even members of its own staff . The series claimed part of the problem is internal and that Comcast 's staff endures unreasonable corporate policies . According to the report : " customer service has been replaced by an obsession with sales ; technicians are understaffed while tech support is poorly trained ; and the company is hobbled by internal fragmentation . " A widely read article penned by an anonymous call center employee working for Comcast appeared in November 2014 on Cracked . Titled " Five Nightmares You Live While Working For America 's Worst Company , " the article also claimed that Comcast is obsessed with sales , does n't train its employees properly and concluded that " the system makes good customer service impossible . "
As of the 2006 Census , there were 100,646 inhabitants in St. John 's itself , 151,322 in the urban area and 181,113 in the St. John 's Census Metropolitan Area ( CMA ) . Thus , St. John 's is Newfoundland and Labrador 's largest city and Canada 's 20th largest CMA . Apart from St. John 's , the CMA includes 12 other communities : the city of Mount Pearl and the towns of Conception Bay South , Paradise , Portugal Cove-St. Philip 's , Torbay , Logy Bay-Middle Cove-Outer Cove , Pouch Cove , Flatrock , Bay Bulls , Witless Bay , Petty Harbour-Maddox Cove and Bauline . The population of the CMA was 192,326 as of 1 July 2010 .
In the later 1890s and into first decade of the 20th century , structural changes occurred in the operation of the Pacific trading companies ; they moved from a practice of having traders resident on each island to instead becoming a business operation where the supercargo ( the cargo manager of a trading ship ) would deal directly with the islanders when a ship visited an island . From 1900 the numbers of palagi traders in Tuvalu declined and the last of the palagi traders were Fred Whibley on Niutao , Alfred Restieaux on Nukufetau , and Martin Kleis on Nui . By 1909 there were no more resident palagi traders representing the trading companies , although both Whibley and Restieaux remained in the islands until their deaths .
Kerry said on September 9 in response to a reporter 's question about whether Syrian President Bashar al-Assad could avert a military strike : " He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week . Turn it over , all of it , without delay , and allow a full and total accounting for that . But he is n't about to do it , and it ca n't be done , obviously . " This unscripted remark initiated a process that would lead to Syria agreeing to relinquish and destroy its chemical weapons arsenal , as Russia treated Kerry 's statement as a serious proposal . Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would work " immediately " to convince Syria relinquish and destroy its large chemical weapons arsenal . Syria quickly welcomed this proposal and on September 14 , the UN formally accepted Syria 's application to join the convention banning chemical weapons , and separately , the U.S. and Russia agreed on a plan to eliminate Syria 's chemical weapons by the middle of 2014 . On September 28 , the UN Security Council passed a resolution ordering the destruction of Syria 's chemical weapons and condemning the August 21 Ghouta attack .
Drug discovery and development is very expensive ; of all compounds investigated for use in humans only a small fraction are eventually approved in most nations by government appointed medical institutions or boards , who have to approve new drugs before they can be marketed in those countries . In 2010 18 NMEs ( New Molecular Entities ) were approved and three biologics by the FDA , or 21 in total , which is down from 26 in 2009 and 24 in 2008 . On the other hand , there were only 18 approvals in total in 2007 and 22 back in 2006 . Since 2001 , the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has averaged 22.9 approvals a year . This approval comes only after heavy investment in pre-clinical development and clinical trials , as well as a commitment to ongoing safety monitoring . Drugs which fail part-way through this process often incur large costs , while generating no revenue in return . If the cost of these failed drugs is taken into account , the cost of developing a successful new drug ( new chemical entity , or NCE ) , has been estimated at about 1.3 billion USD ( not including marketing expenses ) . Professors Light and Lexchin reported in 2012 , however , that the rate of approval for new drugs has been a relatively stable average rate of 15 to 25 for decades .
Major tourist destinations include Times Square ; Broadway theater productions ; the Empire State Building ; the Statue of Liberty ; Ellis Island ; the United Nations Headquarters ; museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art ; greenspaces such as Central Park and Washington Square Park ; Rockefeller Center ; the Manhattan Chinatown ; luxury shopping along Fifth and Madison Avenues ; and events such as the Halloween Parade in Greenwich Village ; the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade ; the lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree ; the St. Patrick 's Day parade ; seasonal activities such as ice skating in Central Park in the wintertime ; the Tribeca Film Festival ; and free performances in Central Park at Summerstage . Major attractions in the boroughs outside Manhattan include Flushing Meadows-Corona Park and the Unisphere in Queens ; the Bronx Zoo ; Coney Island , Brooklyn ; and the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx . The New York Wheel , a 630-foot ferris wheel , was under construction at the northern shore of Staten Island in 2015 , overlooking the Statue of Liberty , New York Harbor , and the Lower Manhattan skyline .
In 1977 , Gaddafi dissolved the Republic and created a new socialist state , the Jamahiriya ( " state of the masses " ) . Officially adopting a symbolic role in governance , he retained power as military commander-in-chief and head of the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing opponents . Overseeing unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad , Gaddafi 's support for foreign militants and alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing led to Libya 's label of " international pariah " . A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States and United Kingdom , resulting in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and United Nations-imposed economic sanctions . Rejecting his earlier ideological commitments , from 1999 Gaddafi encouraged economic privatization and sought rapprochement with Western nations , also embracing Pan-Africanism and helping to establish the African Union . Amid the Arab Spring , in 2011 an anti-Gaddafist uprising led by the National Transitional Council ( NTC ) broke out , resulting in the Libyan Civil War . NATO intervened militarily on the side of the NTC , bringing about the government 's downfall . Retreating to Sirte , Gaddafi was captured and killed by NTC militants .
Weinreich 's identity variant similarly includes the categories of identity diffusion , foreclosure and crisis , but with a somewhat different emphasis . Here , with respect to identity diffusion for example , an optimal level is interpreted as the norm , as it is unrealistic to expect an individual to resolve all their conflicted identifications with others ; therefore we should be alert to individuals with levels which are much higher or lower than the norm – highly diffused individuals are classified as diffused , and those with low levels as foreclosed or defensive . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , 2003 , pp 65–67 ; 105-106 ) . Weinreich applies the identity variant in a framework which also allows for the transition from one to another by way of biographical experiences and resolution of conflicted identifications situated in various contexts – for example , an adolescent going through family break-up may be in one state , whereas later in a stable marriage with a secure professional role may be in another . Hence , though there is continuity , there is also development and change . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , 2003 , pp 22–23 ) .
Consent will also be invalidated if it was induced by the fraudulent conduct of another party , or by the direct or indirect " corruption " of its representative by another party to the treaty . Coercion of either a representative , or the state itself through the threat or use of force , if used to obtain the consent of that state to a treaty , will invalidate that consent .
On April 20 , 2011 , Sony shut down the PlayStation Network and Qriocity for a prolonged interval , revealing on April 23 that this was due to " an external intrusion on our system " . Sony later revealed that the personal information of 77 million users might have been taken , including : names ; addresses ; countries ; email addresses ; birthdates ; PSN/Qriocity logins , passwords and handles/PSN online IDs . They also stated that it was possible that users ' profile data , including purchase history and billing address , and PlayStation Network/Qriocity password security answers may have been obtained . There was no evidence that any credit card data had been taken , but the possibility could not be ruled out , and Sony advised customers that their credit card data may have been obtained . Additionally , the credit card numbers were encrypted and Sony never collected the three digit CVC or CSC number from the back of the credit cards which is required for authenticating some transactions . In response to the incident , Sony announced a " Welcome Back " program , 30 days free membership of PlayStation Plus for all PSN members , two free downloadable PS3 games , and a free one-year enrollment in an identity theft protection program .
The creation–evolution controversy in the United States raises the issue of whether creationistic ideas may be legitimately called science and whether evolution itself may be legitimately called science . In the debate , both sides and even courts in their decisions have frequently invoked Popper 's criterion of falsifiability ( see Daubert standard ) . In this context , passages written by Popper are frequently quoted in which he speaks about such issues himself . For example , he famously stated " Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory , but a metaphysical research program—a possible framework for testable scientific theories . " He continued :
Because the nuns of the order did not preach among the people , the need to engage in study was not as immediate or intense as it was for men . They did participate , however , in a number of intellectual activities . Along with sewing and embroidery , nuns often engaged in reading and discussing correspondence from Church leaders . In the Strassburg monastery of St. Margaret , some of the nuns could converse fluently in Latin . Learning still had an elevated place in the lives of these religious . In fact , Margarette Reglerin , a daughter of a wealthy Nuremberg family , was dismissed from a convent because she did not have the ability or will to learn .
The easternmost section , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) in width , consists of hilly land that runs along the western bank of the Tennessee River . To the west of this narrow strip of land is a wide area of rolling hills and streams that stretches all the way to the Mississippi River ; this area is called the Tennessee Bottoms or bottom land . In Memphis , the Tennessee Bottoms end in steep bluffs overlooking the river . To the west of the Tennessee Bottoms is the Mississippi Alluvial Plain , less than 300 feet ( 90 m ) above sea level . This area of lowlands , flood plains , and swamp land is sometimes referred to as the Delta region . Memphis is the economic center of West Tennessee and the largest city in the state .
New Haven was the location of one of Jim Morrison 's infamous arrests while he fronted the rock group The Doors . The near-riotous concert and arrest in 1967 at the New Haven Arena was commemorated by Morrison in the lyrics to " Peace Frog " which include the line " ... blood in the streets in the town of New Haven ... " This was the first time a rock star had ever been arrested in concert . [ citation needed ] This event is portrayed in the movie The Doors ( 1991 ) , starring Val Kilmer as Morrison , with a concert hall in Los Angeles used to depict the New Haven Arena .
About 30 people have been indicted for participating in genocide or complicity in genocide during the early 1990s in Bosnia . To date , after several plea bargains and some convictions that were successfully challenged on appeal two men , Vujadin Popović and Ljubiša Beara , have been found guilty of committing genocide , Zdravko Tolimir has been found guilty of committing genocide and conspiracy to commit genocide , and two others , Radislav Krstić and Drago Nikolić , have been found guilty of aiding and abetting genocide . Three others have been found guilty of participating in genocides in Bosnia by German courts , one of whom Nikola Jorgić lost an appeal against his conviction in the European Court of Human Rights . A further eight men , former members of the Bosnian Serb security forces were found guilty of genocide by the State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( See List of Bosnian genocide prosecutions ) .
Upon being confirmed in 1966 , she adopted Veronica as a confirmation name . She was raised in the Detroit suburbs of Pontiac and Avon Township ( now Rochester Hills ) . Months before her mother died of breast cancer , Madonna noticed changes in her behavior and personality , although she did not understand the reason . Her mother was at a loss to explain her medical condition , and often began to cry when Madonna questioned her about it . Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying .
The city 's elevation is 2,643 ft ( 806 m ) above sea level ( as measured at the Tucson International Airport ) . Tucson is situated on an alluvial plain in the Sonoran desert , surrounded by five minor ranges of mountains : the Santa Catalina Mountains and the Tortolita Mountains to the north , the Santa Rita Mountains to the south , the Rincon Mountains to the east , and the Tucson Mountains to the west . The high point of the Santa Catalina Mountains is 9,157 ft ( 2,791 m ) Mount Lemmon , the southernmost ski destination in the continental U.S. , while the Tucson Mountains include 4,687 ft ( 1,429 m ) Wasson Peak . The highest point in the area is Mount Wrightson , found in the Santa Rita Mountains at 9,453 ft ( 2,881 m ) above sea level .
Xiamen dialect , sometimes known as Amoy , is the main dialect spoken in the Chinese city of Xiamen and its surrounding regions of Tong'an and Xiang'an , both of which are now included in the Greater Xiamen area . This dialect developed in the late Ming dynasty when Xiamen was increasingly taking over Quanzhou 's position as the main port of trade in southeastern China . Quanzhou traders began travelling southwards to Xiamen to carry on their businesses while Zhangzhou peasants began traveling northwards to Xiamen in search of job opportunities . It is at this time when a need for a common language arose . The Quanzhou and Zhangzhou varieties are similar in many ways ( as can be seen from the common place of Henan Luoyang where they originated ) , but due to differences in accents , communication can be a problem . Quanzhou businessmen considered their speech to be the prestige accent and considered Zhangzhou 's to be a village dialect . Over the centuries , dialect leveling occurred and the two speeches mixed to produce the Amoy dialect .
St Helena has long been known for its high proportion of endemic birds and vascular plants . The highland areas contain most of the 400 endemic species recognised to date . Much of the island has been identified by BirdLife International as being important for bird conservation , especially the endemic Saint Helena plover or wirebird , and for seabirds breeding on the offshore islets and stacks , in the north-east and the south-west Important Bird Areas . On the basis of these endemics and an exceptional range of habitats , Saint Helena is on the United Kingdom 's tentative list for future UNESCO World Heritage Sites .
Both the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira have a subtropical climate , although variations between islands exist , making weather predictions very difficult ( owing to rough topography ) . The Madeira and Azorean archipelagos have a narrower temperature range , with annual average temperatures exceeding 20 °C ( 68 °F ) along the coast ( according to the Portuguese Meteorological Institute ) . Some islands in Azores do have drier months in the summer . Consequently , the island of the Azores have been identified as having a Mediterranean climate ( both Csa and Csb types ) , while some islands ( such as Flores or Corvo ) are classified as Maritime Temperate ( Cfb ) and Humid subtropical ( Cfa ) , respectively , according to Köppen-Geiger classification .
As of 18 June 2012 , the ECB in total had spent €212.1bn ( equal to 2.2 % of the Eurozone GDP ) for bond purchases covering outright debt , as part of its Securities Markets Programme ( SMP ) running since May 2010 . On 6 September 2012 , the ECB announced a new plan for buying bonds from eurozone countries . The duration of the previous SMP was temporary , while the Outright Monetary Transactions ( OMT ) programme has no ex-ante time or size limit . On 4 September 2014 , the bank went further by announcing it would buy bonds and other debt instruments primarily from banks in a bid to boost the availability of credit for businesses .
Temporal theories offer an alternative that appeals to the temporal structure of action potentials , mostly the phase-locking and mode-locking of action potentials to frequencies in a stimulus . The precise way this temporal structure helps code for pitch at higher levels is still debated , but the processing seems to be based on an autocorrelation of action potentials in the auditory nerve . However , it has long been noted that a neural mechanism that may accomplish a delay—a necessary operation of a true autocorrelation—has not been found . At least one model shows that a temporal delay is unnecessary to produce an autocorrelation model of pitch perception , appealing to phase shifts between cochlear filters ; however , earlier work has shown that certain sounds with a prominent peak in their autocorrelation function do not elicit a corresponding pitch percept , and that certain sounds without a peak in their autocorrelation function nevertheless elicit a pitch . To be a more complete model , autocorrelation must therefore apply to signals that represent the output of the cochlea , as via auditory-nerve interspike-interval histograms . Some theories of pitch perception hold that pitch has inherent octave ambiguities , and therefore is best decomposed into a pitch chroma , a periodic value around the octave , like the note names in western music—and a pitch height , which may be ambiguous , that indicates the octave the pitch is in .
Population geneticists have debated whether the concept of population can provide a basis for a new conception of race . In order to do this , a working definition of population must be found . Surprisingly , there is no generally accepted concept of population that biologists use . Although the concept of population is central to ecology , evolutionary biology and conservation biology , most definitions of population rely on qualitative descriptions such as " a group of organisms of the same species occupying a particular space at a particular time " Waples and Gaggiotti identify two broad types of definitions for populations ; those that fall into an ecological paradigm , and those that fall into an evolutionary paradigm . Examples of such definitions are :
Each island has its own high-chief , or ulu-aliki , and several sub-chiefs ( alikis ) . The community council is the Falekaupule ( the traditional assembly of elders ) or te sina o fenua ( literally : " grey-hairs of the land " ) . In the past , another caste , the priests ( tofuga ) , were also amongst the decision-makers . The ulu-aliki and aliki exercise informal authority at the local level . Ulu-aliki are always chosen based on ancestry . Under the Falekaupule Act ( 1997 ) , the powers and functions of the Falekaupule are now shared with the pule o kaupule ( elected village presidents ; one on each atoll ) .
Roosevelt Boulevard and the Roosevelt Expressway ( U.S. 1 ) connect Northeast Philadelphia with Center City . Woodhaven Road ( Route 63 ) , built in 1966 , and Cottman Avenue ( Route 73 ) serve the neighborhoods of Northeast Philadelphia , running between Interstate 95 and the Roosevelt Boulevard ( U.S. 1 ) . The Fort Washington Expressway ( Route 309 ) extends north from the city 's northern border , serving Montgomery County and Bucks County . U.S. 30 , extending east-west from West Philadelphia to Lancaster , is known as Lancaster Avenue throughout most of the city and through the adjacent Main Line suburbs .
Many [ who ? ] expected BSkyB to make a bid to show some of the remaining FA Cup games for the remainder of the 2009–10 season which would include a semi-final and shared rights to the final . ESPN took over the package Setanta held for the FA Cup from the 2010–11 season . The 2011 final was also shown live on Sky 3D in addition to ESPN ( who provided the 3D coverage for Sky 3D ) and ITV . Following the sale of ESPN 's UK and Ireland channels to BT , ESPN 's rights package transferred to BT Sport from the 2013–14 season .
Prompted by legislation in various countries mandating increased bulb efficiency , new " hybrid " incandescent bulbs have been introduced by Philips . The " Halogena Energy Saver " incandescents can produce about 23 lm/W ; about 30 percent more efficient than traditional incandescents , by using a reflective capsule to reflect formerly wasted infrared radiation back to the filament from which it can be re-emitted as visible light . This concept was pioneered by Duro-Test in 1980 with a commercial product that produced 29.8 lm/W . More advanced reflectors based on interference filters or photonic crystals can theoretically result in higher efficiency , up to a limit of about 270 lm/W ( 40 % of the maximum efficacy possible ) . Laboratory proof-of-concept experiments have produced as much as 45 lm/W , approaching the efficacy of compact fluorescent bulbs .
Some recordings , such as books for the blind , were pressed at 16 2⁄3 rpm . Prestige Records released jazz records in this format in the late 1950s ; for example , two of their Miles Davis albums were paired together in this format . Peter Goldmark , the man who developed the 33 1⁄3 rpm record , developed the Highway Hi-Fi 16 2⁄3 rpm record to be played in Chrysler automobiles , but poor performance of the system and weak implementation by Chrysler and Columbia led to the demise of the 16 2⁄3 rpm records . Subsequently , the 16 2⁄3 rpm speed was used for narrated publications for the blind and visually impaired , and were never widely commercially available , although it was common to see new turntable models with a 16 rpm speed setting produced as late as the 1970s .
In July 1956 , Nasser unilaterally nationalised the Suez Canal . The response of Anthony Eden , who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister , was to collude with France to engineer an Israeli attack on Egypt that would give Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal . Eden infuriated US President Dwight D. Eisenhower , by his lack of consultation , and Eisenhower refused to back the invasion . Another of Eisenhower 's concerns was the possibility of a wider war with the Soviet Union after it threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side . Eisenhower applied financial leverage by threatening to sell US reserves of the British pound and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency . Though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objectives , UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces , and Eden resigned .
The malaria problem seems to be compounded by the AIDS epidemic . Research has shown that in Namibia the risk of contracting malaria is 14.5 % greater if a person is also infected with HIV . The risk of death from malaria is also raised by approximately 50 % with a concurrent HIV infection . Given infection rates this large , as well as a looming malaria problem , it may be very difficult for the government to deal with both the medical and economic impacts of this epidemic . The country had only 598 physicians in 2002 .
Teeth ( singular tooth ) are small whitish structures found in the jaws ( or mouths ) of many vertebrates that are used to tear , scrape , milk and chew food . Teeth are not made of bone , but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness , such as enamel , dentine and cementum . Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception . This is the ability of sensation when chewing , for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth , such as a chipped plate mixed in food , our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it can not be chewed , so we stop trying .
In the latter half of his career Hayek made a number of contributions to social and political philosophy , which he based on his views on the limits of human knowledge , and the idea of spontaneous order in social institutions . He argues in favour of a society organised around a market order , in which the apparatus of state is employed almost ( though not entirely ) exclusively to enforce the legal order ( consisting of abstract rules , and not particular commands ) necessary for a market of free individuals to function . These ideas were informed by a moral philosophy derived from epistemological concerns regarding the inherent limits of human knowledge . Hayek argued that his ideal individualistic , free-market polity would be self-regulating to such a degree that it would be 'a society which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it ' .
The design architecture of USB is asymmetrical in its topology , consisting of a host , a multitude of downstream USB ports , and multiple peripheral devices connected in a tiered-star topology . Additional USB hubs may be included in the tiers , allowing branching into a tree structure with up to five tier levels . A USB host may implement multiple host controllers and each host controller may provide one or more USB ports . Up to 127 devices , including hub devices if present , may be connected to a single host controller . USB devices are linked in series through hubs . One hub—built into the host controller—is the root hub .
All of the executions which have taken place since the 1936 hanging of Bethea in Owensboro have been conducted within a wall or enclosure . For example , Fred Adams was legally hanged in Kennett , Missouri , on April 2 , 1937 , within a 10-foot ( 3 m ) wooden stockade . Roscoe " Red " Jackson was hanged within a stockade in Galena , Missouri , on May 26 , 1937 . Two Kentucky hangings were conducted after Galena in which numerous persons were present within a wooden stockade , that of John " Peter " Montjoy in Covington , Kentucky on December 17 , 1937 , and that of Harold Van Venison in Covington on June 3 , 1938 . An estimated 400 witnesses were present for the hanging of Lee Simpson in Ryegate , Montana , on December 30 , 1939 . The execution of Timothy McVeigh on June 11 , 2001 was witnessed by some 300 people , some by closed-circuit television .
The influence of Nasser 's Arab nationalism over the RCC was immediately apparent . The administration was instantly recognized by the neighbouring Arab nationalist regimes in Egypt , Syria , Iraq and Sudan , with Egypt sending experts to aid the inexperienced RCC . Gaddafi propounded Pan-Arab ideas , proclaiming the need for a single Arab state stretching across North Africa and the Middle East . In December 1969 , Libya founded the Arab Revolutionary Front with Egypt and Sudan as a step towards political unification , and in 1970 Syria stated its intention to join .
During the SNES 's life , Nintendo contracted with two different companies to develop a CD-ROM-based peripheral for the console to compete with Sega 's CD-ROM based addon , Mega-CD . Ultimately , deals with both Sony and Philips fell through , ( although a prototype console was produced by Sony ) with Philips gaining the right to release a series of titles based on Nintendo franchises for its CD-i multimedia player and Sony going on to develop its own console based on its initial dealings with Nintendo ( the PlayStation ) .
Scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation , but they believe that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic , hormonal , and environmental influences . They favor biologically-based theories , which point to genetic factors , the early uterine environment , both , or the inclusion of genetic and social factors . There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences play a role when it comes to sexual orientation . Research over several decades has demonstrated that sexual orientation ranges along a continuum , from exclusive attraction to the opposite sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex .
Some rock musicians today use mandolins , often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins . One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys . In addition to electric guitar , bass , and drums , the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music , including mandolin , tin whistle , and Great Highland bagpipes . The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor . The 1991 R.E.M . hit " Losing My Religion " was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck , who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs . The single peaked at No . 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart ( # 1 on the rock and alternative charts ) , Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin , most notably on the Black Crowes song " Locust Street . " Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize . Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions , especially on their 2000 album , Warning . Boyd Tinsley , violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005 . Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band 's music . Nancy Wilson , rhythm guitarist of Heart , uses a mandolin in Heart 's song " Dream of the Archer " from the album Little Queen , as well as in Heart 's cover of Led Zeppelin 's song " The Battle of Evermore . " " Show Me Heaven " by Maria McKee , the theme song to the film Days of Thunder , prominently features a mandolin .
Among the parish churches are Saints John ( Baptist and Evangelist ) , rebuilt in 1368 , whose dome , decorated by Palonino , contains some of the best frescoes in Spain ; El Templo ( the Temple ) , the ancient church of the Knights Templar , which passed into the hands of the Order of Montesa and was rebuilt in the reigns of Ferdinand VI and Charles III ; the former convent of the Dominicans , at one time the headquarters of the Capital General , the cloister of which has a beautiful Gothic wing and the chapter room , large columns imitating palm trees ; the Colegio del Corpus Christi , which is devoted to the Blessed Sacrament , and in which perpetual adoration is carried on ; the Jesuit college , which was destroyed in 1868 by the revolutionary Committee of the Popular Front , but later rebuilt ; and the Colegio de San Juan ( also of the Society ) , the former college of the nobles , now a provincial institute for secondary instruction .
Relations between Grand Lodges are determined by the concept of Recognition . Each Grand Lodge maintains a list of other Grand Lodges that it recognises . When two Grand Lodges recognise and are in Masonic communication with each other , they are said to be in amity , and the brethren of each may visit each other 's Lodges and interact Masonically . When two Grand Lodges are not in amity , inter-visitation is not allowed . There are many reasons why one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another , but the two most common are Exclusive Jurisdiction and Regularity .
Bal Gangadhar Tilak , an Indian nationalist leader , declared Swaraj as the destiny of the nation . His popular sentence " Swaraj is my birthright , and I shall have it " became the source of inspiration for Indians . Tilak was backed by rising public leaders like Bipin Chandra Pal and Lala Lajpat Rai , who held the same point of view . Under them , India 's three big provinces – Maharashtra , Bengal and Punjab , India shaped the demand of the people and India 's nationalism . In 1907 , the Congress was split into two factions : The radicals , led by Tilak , advocated civil agitation and direct revolution to overthrow the British Empire and the abandonment of all things British . The moderates , led by leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale , on the other hand wanted reform within the framework of British rule .
When the Frankish rulers established the system of feudalism , the Bishops of Utrecht came to exercise worldly power as prince-bishops . The territory of the bishopric not only included the modern province of Utrecht ( Nedersticht , 'lower Sticht ' ) , but also extended to the northeast . The feudal conflict of the Middle Ages heavily affected Utrecht . The prince-bishopric was involved in almost continuous conflicts with the Counts of Holland and the Dukes of Guelders . The Veluwe region was seized by Guelders , but large areas in the modern province of Overijssel remained as the Oversticht .
The Times commissioned the serif typeface Times New Roman , created by Victor Lardent at the English branch of Monotype , in 1931 . It was commissioned after Stanley Morison had written an article criticizing The Times for being badly printed and typographically antiquated . The font was supervised by Morison and drawn by Victor Lardent , an artist from the advertising department of The Times . Morison used an older font named Plantin as the basis for his design , but made revisions for legibility and economy of space . Times New Roman made its debut in the issue of 3 October 1932 . After one year , the design was released for commercial sale . The Times stayed with Times New Roman for 40 years , but new production techniques and the format change from broadsheet to tabloid in 2004 have caused the newspaper to switch font five times since 1972 . However , all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman font :
Pesticides are substances meant for attracting , seducing , and then destroying any pest . They are a class of biocide . The most common use of pesticides is as plant protection products ( also known as crop protection products ) , which in general protect plants from damaging influences such as weeds , fungi , or insects . This use of pesticides is so common that the term pesticide is often treated as synonymous with plant protection product , although it is in fact a broader term , as pesticides are also used for non-agricultural purposes . The term pesticide includes all of the following : herbicide , insecticide , insect growth regulator , nematicide , termiticide , molluscicide , piscicide , avicide , rodenticide , predacide , bactericide , insect repellent , animal repellent , antimicrobial , fungicide , disinfectant ( antimicrobial ) , and sanitizer .
Following the war , some of these military airfields added civil facilities for handling passenger traffic . One of the earliest such fields was Paris – Le Bourget Airport at Le Bourget , near Paris . The first airport to operate scheduled international commercial services was Hounslow Heath Aerodrome in August 1919 , but it was closed and supplanted by Croydon Airport in March 1920 . In 1922 , the first permanent airport and commercial terminal solely for commercial aviation was opened at Flughafen Devau near what was then Königsberg , East Prussia . The airports of this era used a paved " apron " , which permitted night flying as well as landing heavier aircraft .
The Suez Canal , built in partnership with the French , was completed in 1869 . Its construction led to enormous debt to European banks , and caused popular discontent because of the onerous taxation it required . In 1875 Ismail was forced to sell Egypt 's share in the canal to the British Government . Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French controllers who sat in the Egyptian cabinet , and , " with the financial power of the bondholders behind them , were the real power in the Government . "
The life cycles of insects vary but most hatch from eggs . Insect growth is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series of molts . The immature stages can differ from the adults in structure , habit and habitat , and can include a passive pupal stage in those groups that undergo 4-stage metamorphosis ( see holometabolism ) . Insects that undergo 3-stage metamorphosis lack a pupal stage and adults develop through a series of nymphal stages . The higher level relationship of the Hexapoda is unclear . Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era , including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70 cm ( 22–28 in ) . The most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plants .
It was temporarily under the control of the Tibetan empire and Chinese from 650–680 and then under the control of the Umayyads in 710 . The Samanid Empire , 819 to 999 , restored Persian control of the region and enlarged the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara ( both cities are today part of Uzbekistan ) which became the cultural centers of Iran and the region was known as Khorasan . The Kara-Khanid Khanate conquered Transoxania ( which corresponds approximately with modern-day Uzbekistan , Tajikistan , southern Kyrgyzstan and southwest Kazakhstan ) and ruled between 999–1211 . Their arrival in Transoxania signaled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia , but gradually the Kara-khanids became assimilated into the Perso-Arab Muslim culture of the region .
Prior to 1992 , Armenians would participate in the Olympics representing the USSR . As part of the Soviet Union , Armenia was very successful , winning plenty of medals and helping the USSR win the medal standings at the Olympics on numerous occasions . The first medal won by an Armenian in modern Olympic history was by Hrant Shahinyan ( sometimes spelled as Grant Shaginyan ) , who won two golds and two silvers in gymnastics at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki . To highlight the level of success of Armenians in the Olympics , Shahinyan was quoted as saying :
The deliberate or accidental hybridising of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown in recent times for economic purposes . The number of successful interspecific mammalian hybrids is relatively small , although it has come to be known that there is a significant number of naturally occurring hybrids between forms or regional varieties of a single species . [ citation needed ] These may form zones of gradation known as clines . Indeed , the distinction between some hitherto distinct species can become clouded once it can be shown that they may not only breed but produce fertile offspring . Some hybrid animals exhibit greater strength and resilience than either parent . This is known as hybrid vigor . The existence of the mule ( donkey sire ; horse dam ) being used widely as a hardy draught animal throughout ancient and modern history is testament to this . Other well known examples are the lion/tiger hybrid , the liger , which is by far the largest big cat and sometimes used in circuses ; and cattle hybrids such as between European and Indian domestic cattle or between domestic cattle and American bison , which are used in the meat industry and marketed as Beefalo . There is some speculation that the donkey itself may be the result of an ancient hybridisation between two wild ass species or sub-species . Hybrid animals are normally infertile partly because their parents usually have slightly different numbers of chromosomes , resulting in unpaired chromosomes in their cells , which prevents division of sex cells and the gonads from operating correctly , particularly in males . There are exceptions to this rule , especially if the speciation process was relatively recent or incomplete as is the case with many cattle and dog species . Normally behavior traits , natural hostility , natural ranges and breeding cycle differences maintain the separateness of closely related species and prevent natural hybridisation . However , the widespread disturbances to natural animal behaviours and range caused by human activity , cities , dumping grounds with food , agriculture , fencing , roads and so on do force animals together which would not normally breed . Clear examples exist between the various sub-species of grey wolf , coyote and domestic dog in North America . As many birds and mammals imprint on their mother and immediate family from infancy , a practice used by animal hybridizers is to foster a planned parent in a hybridization program with the same species as the one with which they are planned to mate .
On April 12 , 1980 , a military coup led by Master Sergeant Samuel Doe of the Krahn ethnic group overthrew and killed President William R. Tolbert , Jr.. Doe and the other plotters later executed a majority of Tolbert 's cabinet and other Americo-Liberian government officials and True Whig Party members . The coup leaders formed the People 's Redemption Council ( PRC ) to govern the country . A strategic Cold War ally of the West , Doe received significant financial backing from the United States while critics condemned the PRC for corruption and political repression .
These regions were occupied by " the brown men , " with the yellow in the Far East and the black in Africa . The color issue was not settled until Kenya became independent in 1963 , ending the last vestige of the British Empire .
Coordination strategies differ when adjacent time zones shift clocks . The European Union shifts all at once , at 01:00 UTC or 02:00 CET or 03:00 EET ; for example , Eastern European Time is always one hour ahead of Central European Time . Most of North America shifts at 02:00 local time , so its zones do not shift at the same time ; for example , Mountain Time is temporarily ( for one hour ) zero hours ahead of Pacific Time , instead of one hour ahead , in the autumn and two hours , instead of one , ahead of Pacific Time in the spring . In the past , Australian districts went even further and did not always agree on start and end dates ; for example , in 2008 most DST-observing areas shifted clocks forward on October 5 but Western Australia shifted on October 26 . In some cases only part of a country shifts ; for example , in the US , Hawaii and most of Arizona do not observe DST .
Guinea-Bissau has started to show some economic advances after a pact of stability was signed by the main political parties of the country , leading to an IMF-backed structural reform program . The key challenges for the country in the period ahead are to achieve fiscal discipline , rebuild public administration , improve the economic climate for private investment , and promote economic diversification . After the country became independent from Portugal in 1974 due to the Portuguese Colonial War and the Carnation Revolution , the rapid exodus of the Portuguese civilian , military , and political authorities resulted in considerable damage to the country 's economic infrastructure , social order , and standard of living .
Many instruments today associated with popular music filled important roles in early classical music , such as bagpipes , vihuelas , hurdy-gurdies , and some woodwind instruments . On the other hand , instruments such as the acoustic guitar , once associated mainly with popular music , gained prominence in classical music in the 19th and 20th centuries .
After a lengthy period of formal racial segregation in the former Confederacy following the Reconstruction Era , and bans on interracial marriage in various parts of the country , more people are openly forming interracial unions . In addition , social conditions have changed and many multiracial people do not believe it is socially advantageous to try to " pass " as white . Diverse immigration has brought more mixed-race people into the United States , such as the large population of Hispanics identifying as mestizos . Since the 1980s , the United States has had a growing multiracial identity movement ( cf . Loving Day ) . Because more Americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins , the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one ethno-racial identity and thereby identify as multiracial . In 2008 Barack Obama was elected as the first multiracial President of the United States ; he acknowledges both sides of his family and identifies as African American .
Gamal Abdel Nasser Hussein ( Arabic : جمال عبد الناصر حسين‎ , IPA : [ ɡæˈmæːl ʕæbdenˈnɑːsˤeɾ ħeˈseːn ] ; 15 January 1918 – 28 September 1970 ) was the second President of Egypt , serving from 1956 until his death . Nasser led the 1952 overthrow of the monarchy and introduced far-reaching land reforms the following year . Following a 1954 attempt on his life by a Muslim Brotherhood member acting on his own , he cracked down on the organization , put President Muhammad Naguib under house arrest , and assumed executive office , officially becoming president in June 1956 .
Dryer and rockier uplands and ridges are occupied by oak-chestnut type forests dominated by a variety of oaks ( Quercus spp . ) , hickories ( Carya spp . ) and , in the past , by the American chestnut ( Castanea dentata ) . The American chestnut was virtually eliminated as a canopy species by the introduced fungal chestnut blight ( Cryphonectaria parasitica ) , but lives on as sapling-sized sprouts that originate from roots , which are not killed by the fungus . In present-day forest canopies chestnut has been largely replaced by oaks .
The Mass of Paul VI was also in Latin but approval was given for the use of vernacular languages . There had been other instructions issued by the Pope in 1964 , 1967 , 1968 , 1969 and 1970 which centered on the reform of all liturgies of the Roman Church . These major reforms were not welcomed by all and in all countries . The sudden apparent " outlawing " of the 400-year-old Mass , the last typical edition of which being promulgated only a few years earlier in 1962 by Paul 's predecessor , Pope John XXIII , was not always explained well . Further experimentation with the new Mass by liturgists , such as the usage of pop/folk music ( as opposed to the Gregorian Chant advocated by Pope Pius X ) , along with concurrent changes in the order of sanctuaries , was viewed by some as vandalism . In 2007 , Pope Benedict XVI clarified that the 1962 Mass of John XXIII and the 1970 Mass of Paul VI are two forms of the same Roman Rite , the first , which had never been " juridically abrogated " , now being an " extraordinary form of the Roman Rite " , while the other " obviously is and continues to be the normal Form – the Forma ordinaria – of the Eucharistic Liturgy " .
In the Treaty of Paris after the Revolution , the British had ceded the lands between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River to the United States , without consulting the Shawnee , Cherokee , Choctaw and other smaller tribes who lived there . Because many of the tribes had fought as allies of the British , the United States compelled tribal leaders to sign away lands in postwar treaties , and began dividing these lands for settlement . This provoked a war in the Northwest Territory in which the U.S. forces performed poorly ; the Battle of the Wabash in 1791 was the most severe defeat ever suffered by the United States at the hands of American Indians . President Washington dispatched a newly trained army to the region , which decisively defeated the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794 .
At the official counting of the electoral votes on January 6 , a motion was made contesting Ohio 's electoral votes . Because the motion was supported by at least one member of both the House of Representatives and the Senate , election law mandated that each house retire to debate and vote on the motion . In the House of Representatives , the motion was supported by 31 Democrats . It was opposed by 178 Republicans , 88 Democrats and one independent . Not voting were 52 Republicans and 80 Democrats . Four people elected to the House had not yet taken office , and one seat was vacant . In the Senate , it was supported only by its maker , Senator Boxer , with 74 Senators opposed and 25 not voting . During the debate , no Senator argued that the outcome of the election should be changed by either court challenge or revote . Senator Boxer claimed that she had made the motion not to challenge the outcome , but to " shed the light of truth on these irregularities . "
Also , Kendals in Manchester can lay claim to being one of the oldest department stores in the UK . Beginning as a small shop owned by S. and J. Watts in 1796 , its sold a variety of goods . Kendal Milne and Faulkner purchased the business in 1835 . Expanding the space , rather than use it as a typical warehouse simply to showcase textiles , it became a vast bazaar . Serving Manchester 's upmarket clientele for over 200 years , it was taken over by House of Fraser and recently rebranded as House of Fraser Manchester – although most Mancunians still refer to it as Kendals . The Kendal Milne signage still remains over the main entrance to the art deco building in the city 's Deansgate .
In 1393 King Richard II compelled landlords to erect signs outside their premises . The legislation stated " Whosoever shall brew ale in the town with intention of selling it must hang out a sign , otherwise he shall forfeit his ale . " This was to make alehouses easily visible to passing inspectors , borough ale tasters , who would decide the quality of the ale they provided . William Shakespeare 's father , John Shakespeare , was one such inspector .
Political unification returned in the mid-16th century , due to the efforts of Taungoo , a former vassal state of Ava . Taungoo 's young , ambitious king Tabinshwehti defeated the more powerful Hanthawaddy in the Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War ( 1534–41 ) . His successor Bayinnaung went on to conquer a vast swath of mainland Southeast Asia including the Shan states , Lan Na , Manipur , Mong Mao , the Ayutthaya Kingdom , Lan Xang and southern Arakan . However , the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia unravelled soon after Bayinnaung 's death in 1581 , completely collapsing by 1599 . Ayutthaya seized Tenasserim and Lan Na , and Portuguese mercenaries established Portuguese rule at Thanlyin ( Syriam ) .
In theory , the stadtholders were freely appointed by and subordinate to the states of each province . However , in practice the princes of Orange of the House of Orange-Nassau , beginning with William the Silent , were always chosen as stadtholders of most of the provinces . Zeeland and usually Utrecht had the same stadtholder as Holland .
In addressing the question of who invented the incandescent lamp , historians Robert Friedel and Paul Israel list 22 inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Joseph Swan and Thomas Edison . They conclude that Edison 's version was able to outstrip the others because of a combination of three factors : an effective incandescent material , a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve ( by use of the Sprengel pump ) and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable .
The Palacio Taranco is located in front of the Plaza Zabala , in the heart of Ciudad Vieja . It was erected in the early 20th century as the residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers on the ruins of Montevideo 's first theatre ( of 1793 ) , during a period in which the architectural style was influenced by French architecture . The palace was designed by French architects Charles Louis Girault and Jules Chifflot León who also designed the Petit Palais and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris . It passed to the city from the heirs of the Tarancos in 1943 , along with its precious collection of Uruguayan furniture and draperies and was deemed by the city as an ideal place for a museum ; in 1972 it became the Museum of Decorative Arts of Montevideo and in 1975 it became a National Heritage Site . The Decorative Arts Museum has an important collection of European paintings and decorative arts , ancient Greek and Roman art and Islamic ceramics of the 10th–18th century from the area of present-day Iran . The palace is often used as a meeting place by the Uruguayan government .
Critical and commercial reception to PS3 improved over time , after a series of price revisions , Blu-ray 's victory over HD DVD , and the release of several well received titles . Ars Technica 's original launch review gave PS3 only a 6/10 , but second review of the console in June 2008 rated it a 9/10 . In September 2009 , IGN named PlayStation 3 the 15th best gaming console of all time , behind both of its competitors : Wii ( 10th ) and Xbox 360 ( 6th ) . However , PS3 has won IGN 's " Console Showdown " —based on which console offers the best selection of games released during each year—in three of the four years since it began ( 2008 , 2009 and 2011 , with Xbox winning in 2010 ) . IGN judged PlayStation 3 to have the best game line-up of 2008 , based on their review scores in comparison to those of Wii and Xbox 360 . In a comparison piece by PC mag 's Will Greenwald in June 2012 , PS3 was selected as an overall better console compared to Xbox 360 . Pocket-lint said of the console " The PS3 has always been a brilliant games console , " and that " For now , this is just about the best media device for the money . "
The polyphony of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century , with compositions by Josquin des Prez . The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument , although this instrument would merely double the singers ' parts and was not independent . By the 16th century , a cappella polyphony had further developed , but gradually , the cantata began to take the place of a cappella forms . 16th century a cappella polyphony , nonetheless , continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day . Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina , such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ " doubling " some or all of the voices . Such is seen in the life of Palestrina becoming a major influence on Bach , most notably in the aforementioned Mass in B Minor . Other composers that utilized the a cappella style , if only for the occasional piece , were Claudio Monteverdi and his masterpiece , Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata ( A lover 's tears at his beloved 's grave ) , which was composed in 1610 , and Andrea Gabrieli when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces , one of which was in the unaccompanied style . Learning from the preceding two composeres , Heinrich Schütz utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces , chief among these were the pieces in the oratorio style , which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week , such as Christ 's suffering and the Passion . Five of Schutz 's Historien were Easter pieces , and of these the latter three , which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints , those of Matthew , Luke and John , were all done a cappella style . This was a near requirement for this type of piece , and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted parts from either Christ or the authors were performed in a plainchant .
From 1904 to 1907 , the Herero and the Namaqua took up arms against the Germans and in calculated punitive action by the German occupiers , the 'first genocide of the Twentieth Century ' was committed . In the Herero and Namaqua genocide , 10,000 Nama ( half the population ) and approximately 65,000 Hereros ( about 80 % of the population ) were systematically murdered . The survivors , when finally released from detention , were subjected to a policy of dispossession , deportation , forced labour , racial segregation and discrimination in a system that in many ways anticipated apartheid .
When paying a state visit to Britain , foreign heads of state are usually entertained by the Queen at Buckingham Palace . They are allocated a large suite of rooms known as the Belgian Suite , situated at the foot of the Minister 's Staircase , on the ground floor of the north-facing Garden Wing . The rooms of the suite are linked by narrow corridors , one of them is given extra height and perspective by saucer domes designed by Nash in the style of Soane . A second corridor in the suite has Gothic influenced cross over vaulting . The Belgian Rooms themselves were decorated in their present style and named after Prince Albert 's uncle Léopold I , first King of the Belgians . In 1936 , the suite briefly became the private apartments of the palace when they were occupied by King Edward VIII .
Von Neumann 's ability to instantaneously perform complex operations in his head stunned other mathematicians . Eugene Wigner wrote that , seeing von Neumann 's mind at work , " one had the impression of a perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch . " Paul Halmos states that " von Neumann 's speed was awe-inspiring . " Israel Halperin said : " Keeping up with him was ... impossible . The feeling was you were on a tricycle chasing a racing car . " Edward Teller wrote that von Neumann effortlessly outdid anybody he ever met , and said " I never could keep up with him " . Teller also said " von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3-year-old son , and the two of them would talk as equals , and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us . Most people avoid thinking if they can , some of us are addicted to thinking , but von Neumann actually enjoyed thinking , maybe even to the exclusion of everything else . "
The George Washington Bridge is the world 's busiest motor vehicle bridge , connecting Manhattan to Bergen County , New Jersey . The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the Americas and one of the world 's longest . The Brooklyn Bridge is an icon of the city itself . The towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are built of limestone , granite , and Rosendale cement , and their architectural style is neo-Gothic , with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers . This bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903 , and is the first steel-wire suspension bridge .

General Electric heavily contaminated the Hudson River with polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) between 1947-77 . This pollution caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people who eat fish from the river or drink the water . In response to this contamination , activists protested in various ways . Musician Pete Seeger founded the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater and the Clearwater Festival to draw attention to the problem . The activism led to the site being designated by the EPA as one of the superfund sites requiring extensive cleanup . Other sources of pollution , including mercury contamination and sewage dumping , have also contributed to problems in the Hudson River watershed .
Developed at roughly the same time as the USB 3.1 specification , but distinct from it , the USB Type-C Specification 1.0 was finalized in August 2014 and defines a new small reversible-plug connector for USB devices . The Type-C plug connects to both hosts and devices , replacing various Type-A and Type-B connectors and cables with a standard meant to be future-proof , similar to Apple Lightning and Thunderbolt . The 24-pin double-sided connector provides four power/ground pairs , two differential pairs for USB 2.0 data bus ( though only one pair is implemented in a Type-C cable ) , four pairs for high-speed data bus , two " sideband use " pins , and two configuration pins for cable orientation detection , dedicated biphase mark code ( BMC ) configuration data channel , and VCONN +5 V power for active cables . Type-A and Type-B adaptors and cables are required for older devices to plug into Type-C hosts . Adapters and cables with a Type-C receptacle are not allowed . [ citation needed ]

The next week , Lil Rounds and Anoop Desai were eliminated .
Between 1985 and 2015 , Israel sent 24 delegations of IDF search and rescue unit to 22 countries . In Haiti , immediately following the 2010 earthquake , Israel was the first country to set up a field hospital capable of performing surgical operations . Israel sent over 200 medical doctors and personnel to start treating injured Haitians at the scene . At the conclusion of its humanitarian mission 11 days later , the Israeli delegation had treated more than 1,110 patients , conducted 319 successful surgeries , delivered 16 births and rescued or assisted in the rescue of four individuals . Despite radiation concerns , Israel was one of the first countries to send a medical delegation to Japan following the earthquake and tsunami disaster . Israel dispatched a medical team to the tsunami-stricken city of Kurihara in 2011 . A medical clinic run by an IDF team of some 50 members featured pediatric , surgical , maternity and gynecological , and otolaryngology wards , together with an optometry department , a laboratory , a pharmacy and an intensive care unit . After treating 200 patients in two weeks , the departing emergency team donated its equipment to the Japanese .
Charlemagne 's court in Aachen was the centre of the cultural revival sometimes referred to as the " Carolingian Renaissance " . Literacy increased , as did development in the arts , architecture and jurisprudence , as well as liturgical and scriptural studies . The English monk Alcuin ( d. 804 ) was invited to Aachen and brought the education available in the monasteries of Northumbria . Charlemagne 's chancery—or writing office—made use of a new script today known as Carolingian minuscule , [ M ] allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe . Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy , imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains , as well as the Gregorian chant in liturgical music for the churches . An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying , correcting , and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics , with the aim of encouraging learning . New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced . Grammarians of the period modified the Latin language , changing it from the Classical Latin of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form to fit the needs of the church and government . By the reign of Charlemagne , the language had so diverged from the classical that it was later called Medieval Latin .
After the Civil War , population expansion , railroad construction , and the disappearance of the buffalo herds heightened military tensions on the Great Plains . Several tribes , especially the Sioux and Comanche , fiercely resisted confinement to reservations . The main role of the Army was to keep indigenous peoples on reservations and to end their wars against settlers and each other , William Tecumseh Sherman and Philip Sheridan were in charge . A famous victory for the Plains Nations was the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 , when Col. George Armstrong Custer and two hundred plus members of the 7th Cavalry were killed by a force consisting of Native Americans from the Lakota , Northern Cheyenne , and Arapaho nations . The last significant conflict came in 1891 .
Some alloys occur naturally , such as electrum , which is an alloy that is native to Earth , consisting of silver and gold . Meteorites are sometimes made of naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel , but are not native to the Earth . One of the first alloys made by humans was bronze , which is made by mixing the metals tin and copper . Bronze was an extremely useful alloy to the ancients , because it is much stronger and harder than either of its components . Steel was another common alloy . However , in ancient times , it could only be created as an accidental byproduct from the heating of iron ore in fires ( smelting ) during the manufacture of iron . Other ancient alloys include pewter , brass and pig iron . In the modern age , steel can be created in many forms . Carbon steel can be made by varying only the carbon content , producing soft alloys like mild steel or hard alloys like spring steel . Alloy steels can be made by adding other elements , such as molybdenum , vanadium or nickel , resulting in alloys such as high-speed steel or tool steel . Small amounts of manganese are usually alloyed with most modern-steels because of its ability to remove unwanted impurities , like phosphorus , sulfur and oxygen , which can have detrimental effects on the alloy . However , most alloys were not created until the 1900s , such as various aluminium , titanium , nickel , and magnesium alloys . Some modern superalloys , such as incoloy , inconel , and hastelloy , may consist of a multitude of different components .
Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding , representation , and handling of text expressed in most of the world 's writing systems . Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set ( UCS ) standard and published as The Unicode Standard , the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 120,000 characters covering 129 modern and historic scripts , as well as multiple symbol sets . The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference , an encoding method and set of standard character encodings , a set of reference data files , and a number of related items , such as character properties , rules for normalization , decomposition , collation , rendering , and bidirectional display order ( for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts , such as Arabic and Hebrew , and left-to-right scripts ) . As of June 2015 [ update ] , the most recent version is Unicode 8.0 . The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium .
Students from the Imperial University organized a widespread student protest against the eunuchs of Emperor Huan 's court . Huan further alienated the bureaucracy when he initiated grandiose construction projects and hosted thousands of concubines in his harem at a time of economic crisis . Palace eunuchs imprisoned the official Li Ying ( 李膺 ) and his associates from the Imperial University on a dubious charge of treason . In 167 AD , the Grand Commandant Dou Wu ( d. 168 AD ) convinced his son-in-law , Emperor Huan , to release them . However the emperor permanently barred Li Ying and his associates from serving in office , marking the beginning of the Partisan Prohibitions .
South West Africa became known as Namibia by the UN when the General Assembly changed the territory 's name by Resolution 2372 ( XXII ) of 12 June 1968 . In 1978 the UN Security Council passed UN Resolution 435 which planned a transition toward independence for Namibia . Attempts to persuade South Africa to agree to the plan 's implementation were not successful until 1988 when the transition to independence finally started under a diplomatic agreement between South Africa , Angola and Cuba , with the USSR and the USA as observers , under which South Africa agreed to withdraw and demobilise its forces in Namibia . As a result , Cuba agreed to pull back its troops in southern Angola sent to support the MPLA in its war for control of Angola with UNITA .
In their first meeting after the election the group 's Members of Parliament decided to adopt the name " The Labour Party " formally ( 15 February 1906 ) . Keir Hardie , who had taken a leading role in getting the party established , was elected as Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party ( in effect , the Leader ) , although only by one vote over David Shackleton after several ballots . In the party 's early years the Independent Labour Party ( ILP ) provided much of its activist base as the party did not have individual membership until 1918 but operated as a conglomerate of affiliated bodies . The Fabian Society provided much of the intellectual stimulus for the party . One of the first acts of the new Liberal Government was to reverse the Taff Vale judgement .
In January 2008 , Kaz Hirai , CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment , suggested that the console may start making a profit by early 2009 , stating that , " the next fiscal year starts in April and if we can try to achieve that in the next fiscal year that would be a great thing " and that " [ profitability ] is not a definite commitment , but that is what I would like to try to shoot for " . However , market analysts Nikko Citigroup have predicted that PlayStation 3 could be profitable by August 2008 . In a July 2008 interview , Hirai stated that his objective is for PlayStation 3 to sell 150 million units by its ninth year , surpassing PlayStation 2 's sales of 140 million in its nine years on the market . In January 2009 Sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in Q3 2008 .
Building first evolved out of the dynamics between needs ( shelter , security , worship , etc . ) and means ( available building materials and attendant skills ) . As human cultures developed and knowledge began to be formalized through oral traditions and practices , building became a craft , and " architecture " is the name given to the most highly formalized and respected versions of that craft .
Genocide has become an official term used in international relations . The word genocide was not in use before 1944 . Before this , in 1941 , Winston Churchill described the mass killing of Russian prisoners of war and civilians as " a crime without a name " . In that year , a Polish-Jewish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin , described the policies of systematic murder founded by the Nazis as genocide . The word genocide is the combination of the Greek prefix geno- ( meaning tribe or race ) and caedere ( the Latin word for to kill ) . The word is defined as a specific set of violent crimes that are committed against a certain group with the attempt to remove the entire group from existence or to destroy them .
Chickens raised intensively for their meat are known as " broilers " . Breeds have been developed that can grow to an acceptable carcass size ( 2 kg ( 4.4 lb ) ) in six weeks or less . Broilers grow so fast , their legs can not always support their weight and their hearts and respiratory systems may not be able to supply enough oxygen to their developing muscles . Mortality rates at 1 % are much higher than for less-intensively reared laying birds which take 18 weeks to reach similar weights . Processing the birds is done automatically with conveyor-belt efficiency . They are hung by their feet , stunned , killed , bled , scalded , plucked , have their heads and feet removed , eviscerated , washed , chilled , drained , weighed , and packed , all within the course of little over two hours .
The Cubs ' current spring training facility is located in Sloan Park in |Mesa , Arizona , where they play in the Cactus League . The park seats 15,000 , making it Major League baseball 's largest spring training facility by capacity . The Cubs annually sell out most of their games both at home and on the road . Before Sloan Park opened in 2014 , the team played games at HoHoKam Park - Dwight Patterson Field from 1979 . " HoHoKam " is literally translated from Native American as " those who vanished . " The North Siders have called Mesa their spring home for most seasons since 1952 .
North Carolina averages fewer than 20 tornadoes per year , many of them produced by hurricanes or tropical storms along the coastal plain . Tornadoes from thunderstorms are a risk , especially in the eastern part of the state . The western Piedmont is often protected by the mountains , which tend to break up storms as they try to cross over ; the storms will often re-form farther east . Also a weather phenomenon known as " cold air damming " often occurs in the northwestern part of the state , which can also weaken storms but can also lead to major ice events in winter .
The personal copying exemption in the copyright law of EU member states stems from the EU Copyright Directive of 2001 , which is generally devised to allow EU members to enact laws sanctioning making copies without authorization , as long as they are for personal , noncommerical use . The Copyright Directive was not intended to legitimize file-sharing , but rather the common practice of space shifting copyright-protected content from a legally purchased CD ( for example ) to certain kinds of devices and media , provided rights holders are compensated and no copy protection measures are circumvented . Rights-holder compensation takes various forms , depending on the country , but is generally either a levy on " recording " devices and media , or a tax on the content itself . In some countries , such as Canada , the applicability of such laws to copying onto general-purpose storage devices like computer hard drives , portable media players , and phones , for which no levies are collected , has been the subject of debate and further efforts to reform copyright law .
Napoleon returned to Paris and found that both the legislature and the people had turned against him . Realizing his position was untenable , he abdicated on 22 June in favour of his son . He left Paris three days later and settled at Josephine 's former palace in Malmaison ( on the western bank of the Seine about 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) west of Paris ) . Even as Napoleon travelled to Paris , the Coalition forces crossed the frontier swept through France ( arriving in the vicinity of Paris on 29 June ) , with the stated intent on restoring Louis XVIII to the French throne .
In separate testimony to Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission , officers of Clayton Holdings—the largest residential loan due diligence and securitization surveillance company in the United States and Europe—testified that Clayton 's review of over 900,000 mortgages issued from January 2006 to June 2007 revealed that scarcely 54 % of the loans met their originators’ underwriting standards . The analysis ( conducted on behalf of 23 investment and commercial banks , including 7 " too big to fail " banks ) additionally showed that 28 % of the sampled loans did not meet the minimal standards of any issuer . Clayton 's analysis further showed that 39 % of these loans ( i.e . those not meeting any issuer 's minimal underwriting standards ) were subsequently securitized and sold to investors .
Many early 19th-century neoclassical architects were influenced by the drawings and projects of Étienne-Louis Boullée and Claude Nicolas Ledoux . The many graphite drawings of Boullée and his students depict spare geometrical architecture that emulates the eternality of the universe . There are links between Boullée 's ideas and Edmund Burke 's conception of the sublime . Ledoux addressed the concept of architectural character , maintaining that a building should immediately communicate its function to the viewer : taken literally such ideas give rise to " architecture parlante " .
Poultry ( /ˌpoʊltriː/ ) are domesticated birds kept by humans for the eggs they produce , their meat , their feathers , or sometimes as pets . These birds are most typically members of the superorder Galloanserae ( fowl ) , especially the order Galliformes ( which includes chickens , quails and turkeys ) and the family Anatidae , in order Anseriformes , commonly known as " waterfowl " and including domestic ducks and domestic geese . Poultry also includes other birds that are killed for their meat , such as the young of pigeons ( known as squabs ) but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game . The word " poultry " comes from the French/Norman word poule , itself derived from the Latin word pullus , which means small animal .
Politically , the paper 's stance was less clear under Prime Minister Gordon Brown who succeeded Blair in June 2007 . Its editorials were critical of many of Brown 's policies and often more supportive of those of Conservative leader David Cameron . Rupert Murdoch , head of The Sun 's parent company News Corporation , speaking at a 2007 meeting with the House of Lords Select Committee on Communications , which was investigating media ownership and the news , said that he acts as a " traditional proprietor " . This means he exercises editorial control on major issues such as which political party to back in a general election or which policy to adopt on Europe .
Galicia is further divided into 53 comarcas , 315 municipalities ( 93 in A Coruña , 67 in Lugo , 92 in Ourense , 62 in Pontevedra ) and 3,778 parishes . Municipalities are divided into parishes , which may be further divided into aldeas ( " hamlets " ) or lugares ( " places " ) . This traditional breakdown into such small areas is unusual when compared to the rest of Spain . Roughly half of the named population entities of Spain are in Galicia , which occupies only 5.8 percent of the country 's area . It is estimated that Galicia has over a million named places , over 40,000 of them being communities .
Tito 's foreign policy led to relationships with a variety of governments , such as exchanging visits ( 1954 and 1956 ) with Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia , where a street was named in his honor .
As a non-directive and flexible analytical tool , the concept of boundaries helps both to map and to define the changeability and mutability that are characteristic of people 's experiences of the self in society . While identity is a volatile , flexible and abstract 'thing ' , its manifestations and the ways in which it is exercised are often open to view . Identity is made evident through the use of markers such as language , dress , behaviour and choice of space , whose effect depends on their recognition by other social beings . Markers help to create the boundaries that define similarities or differences between the marker wearer and the marker perceivers , their effectiveness depends on a shared understanding of their meaning . In a social context , misunderstandings can arise due to a misinterpretation of the significance of specific markers . Equally , an individual can use markers of identity to exert influence on other people without necessarily fulfilling all the criteria that an external observer might typically associate with such an abstract identity .
Regardless of the ability of the Luftwaffe to win air superiority , Adolf Hitler was frustrated that it was not happening quickly enough . With no sign of the RAF weakening , and Luftwaffe air fleets ( Luftflotten ) taking punishing losses , the OKL was keen for a change in strategy . To reduce losses further , a change in strategy was also favoured to take place at night , to give the bombers greater protection under cover of darkness . [ b ] On 4 September 1940 , in a long address at the Sportspalast , Hitler declared : " And should the Royal Air Force drop two thousand , or three thousand [ kilograms ... ] then we will now drop [ ... ] 300,000 , 400,000 , yes one million kilograms in a single night . And should they declare they will greatly increase their attacks on our cities , then we will erase their cities . "
St. John 's is served by the Eastern School District , the largest school district in Newfoundland and Labrador by student population . There are currently 36 primary , elementary and secondary schools in the city of St. John 's , including three private schools . St. John 's also includes one school that is part of the province-wide Conseil Scolaire Francophone ( CSF ) , the Francophone public school district .

MUN provides comprehensive education and grants degrees in several fields and its historical strengths in engineering , business , geology , and medicine , make MUN one of the top comprehensive universities in Canada . The Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland ( MI ) or simply Marine Institute , is a post-secondary ocean and marine polytechnic located in St. John 's and is affiliated with Memorial University of Newfoundland . MUN also offers the lowest tuition in Canada ( $ 2,644 , per Academic Year )
In terms of impact on events , it was more than Napoleon 's personality that took effect . He reorganized France itself to supply the men and money needed for great wars . Above all he inspired his men—Wellington said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 soldiers , for he inspired confidence from privates to field marshals . He also unnerved the enemy . At the Battle of Auerstadt in 1806 , King Frederick William III of Prussia outnumbered the French by 63,000 to 27,000 ; however , when he mistakenly was told that Napoleon was in command , he ordered a hasty retreat that turned into a rout . The force of his personality neutralized material difficulties as his soldiers fought with the confidence that with Napoleon in charge they would surely win .
Peace negotiations at the Congress of Paris resulted in the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 30 March 1856 . In compliance with article III , Russia restored to the Ottoman Empire the city and citadel of Kars in common with " all other parts of the Ottoman territory of which the Russian troop were in possession " . Russia ceded some land in Bessarabia at the mouth of the Danube to Moldavia . By article IV The United Kingdom , France , Sardinia and Turkey restored to Russia " the towns and ports of Sevastopol , Balaklava , Kamish , Eupatoria , Kerch , Jenikale , Kinburn , as well as all other territories occupied by the allied troops " . In conformity with article XI and XIII , the Tsar and the Sultan agreed not to establish any naval or military arsenal on the Black Sea coast . The Black Sea clauses weakened Russia , and it no longer posed a naval threat to the Ottomans . The principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia were nominally returned to the Ottoman Empire ; in practice they became independent . The Great Powers pledged to respect the independence and territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire . :432–33
Many television shows and films have been produced which portray in-character professional wrestlers as protagonists , such as Ready to Rumble , ¡Mucha Lucha ! , Nacho Libre , and the Santo film series . In the wildly popular Rocky series of films about the fictional boxer Rocky Balboa , Rocky III saw its hero fighting a " boxer vs. wrestler " exhibition match against the enormous and villainous wrestler " Thunderlips " , portrayed by real-life soon-to-be wrestling icon Hulk Hogan . At least two stage plays set in the world of pro wrestling have been produced : The Baron is a comedy that retells the life of an actual performer known as Baron von Raschke . From Parts Unknown ... is an award-nominated Canadian drama about the rise and fall of a fictional wrestler . The 2009 South Park episode " W.T.F . " played on the soap operatic elements of professional wrestling . One of the lead characters on the Disney Channel series Kim Possible was a huge fan of pro wrestling and actually featured it on an episode ( with two former WWE wrestlers voicing the two fictitious wrestlers featured in the episode ) . The 2008 film The Wrestler , about a washed-up professional wrestler , garnered several Oscar nominations .
John was born to Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine on 24 December 1166 . Henry had inherited significant territories along the Atlantic seaboard—Anjou , Normandy and England—and expanded his empire by conquering Brittany . Henry married the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine , who reigned over the Duchy of Aquitaine and had a tenuous claim to Toulouse and Auvergne in southern France , in addition to being the former wife of Louis VII of France . The result was the Angevin Empire , named after Henry 's paternal title as Count of Anjou and , more specifically , its seat in Angers . [ nb 2 ] The Empire , however , was inherently fragile : although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry , the disparate parts each had their own histories , traditions and governance structures . As one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine , the extent of Henry 's power in the provinces diminished considerably , scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all . Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time . It was unclear what would happen to the empire on Henry 's death . Although the custom of primogeniture , under which an eldest son would inherit all his father 's lands , was slowly becoming more widespread across Europe , it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England . Most believed that Henry would divide the empire , giving each son a substantial portion , and hoping that his children would continue to work together as allies after his death . To complicate matters , much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France of the rival line of the House of Capet . Henry had often allied himself with the Holy Roman Emperor against France , making the feudal relationship even more challenging .
From 1981 to 2010 , the average annual precipitation measured at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport was 37.49 inches ( 952 mm ) . Annual precipitation has ranged from 23.78 in ( 604 mm ) in 1952 to 55.14 in ( 1,401 mm ) in 1950 ; for water year ( October 1 – September 30 ) precipitation , the range is 23.16 in ( 588 mm ) in 1976–77 to 51.82 in ( 1,316 mm ) in 1996–97 . Due to local variations in microclimate , Seattle also receives significantly lower precipitation than some other locations west of the Cascades . Around 80 mi ( 129 km ) to the west , the Hoh Rain Forest in Olympic National Park on the western flank of the Olympic Mountains receives an annual average precipitation of 142 in ( 3.61 m ) . Sixty miles to the south of Seattle , the state capital Olympia , which is out of the Olympic Mountains ' rain shadow , receives an annual average precipitation of 50 in ( 1,270 mm ) . The city of Bremerton , about 15 mi ( 24 km ) west of downtown Seattle , receives 56.4 in ( 1,430 mm ) of precipitation annually .
Bonaparte could win battles by concealment of troop deployments and concentration of his forces on the 'hinge ' of an enemy 's weakened front . If he could not use his favourite envelopment strategy , he would take up the central position and attack two co-operating forces at their hinge , swing round to fight one until it fled , then turn to face the other . In this Italian campaign , Bonaparte 's army captured 150,000 prisoners , 540 cannons , and 170 standards . The French army fought 67 actions and won 18 pitched battles through superior artillery technology and Bonaparte 's tactics .
The Space Age is a period encompassing the activities related to the Space Race , space exploration , space technology , and the cultural developments influenced by these events . The Space Age began with the development of several technologies that culminated with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union . This was the world 's first artificial satellite , orbiting the Earth in 98.1 minutes and weighing in at 83 kg . The launch of Sputnik 1 ushered a new era of political , scientific and technological achievements that became known as the Space Age . The Space Age was characterized by rapid development of new technology in a close race mostly between the United States and the Soviet Union . The Space Age brought the first human spaceflight during the Vostok programme and reached its peak with the Apollo program which captured the imagination of much of the world 's population . The landing of Apollo 11 was an event watched by over 500 million people around the world and is widely recognized as one of the defining moments of the 20th century . Since then and with the end of the space race due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union , public attention has largely moved to other areas .
Religion is extremely important to the Tibetans and has a strong influence over all aspects of their lives . Bön is the ancient religion of Tibet , but has been almost eclipsed by Tibetan Buddhism , a distinctive form of Mahayana and Vajrayana , which was introduced into Tibet from the Sanskrit Buddhist tradition of northern India . Tibetan Buddhism is practiced not only in Tibet but also in Mongolia , parts of northern India , the Buryat Republic , the Tuva Republic , and in the Republic of Kalmykia and some other parts of China . During China 's Cultural Revolution , nearly all Tibet 's monasteries were ransacked and destroyed by the Red Guards . A few monasteries have begun to rebuild since the 1980s ( with limited support from the Chinese government ) and greater religious freedom has been granted – although it is still limited . Monks returned to monasteries across Tibet and monastic education resumed even though the number of monks imposed is strictly limited . Before the 1950s , between 10 and 20 % of males in Tibet were monks .
The Ottoman Islamic legal system was set up differently from traditional European courts . Presiding over Islamic courts would be a Qadi , or judge . Since the closing of the ijtihad , or Gate of Interpretation , Qadis throughout the Ottoman Empire focused less on legal precedent , and more with local customs and traditions in the areas that they administered . However , the Ottoman court system lacked an appellate structure , leading to jurisdictional case strategies where plaintiffs could take their disputes from one court system to another until they achieved a ruling that was in their favor .
The Federation of International Gymnastics ( FIG ) was founded in Liege in 1881 . By the end of the nineteenth century , men 's gymnastics competition was popular enough to be included in the first " modern " Olympic Games in 1896 . From then on until the early 1950s , both national and international competitions involved a changing variety of exercises gathered under the rubric , gymnastics , that would seem strange to today 's audiences and that included for example , synchronized team floor calisthenics , rope climbing , high jumping , running , and horizontal ladder . During the 1920s , women organized and participated in gymnastics events . The first women 's Olympic competition was primitive , only involving synchronized calisthenics and track and field . These games were held in 1928 , in Amsterdam .
With the mixture of radio friendly AC tunes with some rock and pop fare also landing on the pop charts , mainstream songs won over many critics in the need to define AC , and appeared to change the tolerance and acceptance of AC music into mainstream day to day radio play . Part of the reason why more and more hot AC stations are forced to change is that less and less new music fits their bill ; most new rock is too alternative for mainstream radio and most new pop is now influenced heavily by dance-pop and electronic dance music .
Several bit rates are specified in the MPEG-1 Audio Layer III standard : 32 , 40 , 48 , 56 , 64 , 80 , 96 , 112 , 128 , 160 , 192 , 224 , 256 and 320 kbit/s , with available sampling frequencies of 32 , 44.1 and 48 kHz . MPEG-2 Audio Layer III allows bit rates of 8 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 , 56 , 64 , 80 , 96 , 112 , 128 , 144 , 160 kbit/s with sampling frequencies of 16 , 22.05 and 24 kHz . MPEG-2.5 Audio Layer III is restricted to bit rates of 8 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 , 56 and 64 kbit/s with sampling frequencies of 8 , 11.025 , and 12 kHz . [ citation needed ] Because of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem , frequency reproduction is always strictly less than half of the sampling frequency , and imperfect filters requires a larger margin for error ( noise level versus sharpness of filter ) , so 8 kHz sampling rate limits the maximum frequency to 4 kHz , while 48 kHz maximum sampling rate limits an MP3 to 24 kHz sound reproduction .
Bomber crews already had some experience with these types of systems due to the deployment of the Lorenz beam , a commercial blind-landing aid which allowed aircraft to land at night or in bad weather . The Germans developed the short-range Lorenz system into the Knickebein aid , a system which used two Lorenz beams with much stronger signal transmissions . The concept was the same as the Lorenz system . Two aerials were rotated for the two converging beams which were pointed to cross directly over the target . The German bombers would attach themselves to either beam and fly along it until they started to pick up the signal from the other beam . When a continuous sound was heard from the second beam the crew knew they were above the target and began dropping their bombs .
The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War ( German : Deutsch-Französischer Krieg , lit . German-French War , French : Guerre franco-allemande , lit . Franco-German War ) , often referred to in France as the War of 1870 ( 19 July 1870 – 10 May 1871 ) , was a conflict between the Second French Empire and the German states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia . The conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to extend German unification . Some historians argue that the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck planned to provoke a French attack in order to draw the southern German states—Baden , Württemberg , Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadt—into an alliance with the North German Confederation dominated by Prussia , while others contend that Bismarck did not plan anything and merely exploited the circumstances as they unfolded .
Napoleon married Joséphine de Beauharnais in 1796 , when he was 26 ; she was a 32-year-old widow whose first husband had been executed during the Revolution . Until she met Bonaparte , she had been known as " Rose " , a name which he disliked . He called her " Joséphine " instead , and she went by this name henceforth . Bonaparte often sent her love letters while on his campaigns . He formally adopted her son Eugène and cousin Stéphanie and arranged dynastic marriages for them . Joséphine had her daughter Hortense marry Napoleon 's brother Louis .
Washington University has over 300 undergraduate student organizations on campus . Most are funded by the Washington University Student Union , which has a $ 2 million plus annual budget that is completely student-controlled and is one of the largest student government budgets in the country . Known as SU for short , the Student Union sponsors large-scale campus programs including WILD ( a semesterly concert in the quad ) and free copies of the New York Times , USA Today , and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch through The Collegiate Readership Program ; it also contributes to the Assembly Series , a weekly lecture series produced by the University , and funds the campus television station , WUTV , and the radio station , KWUR . KWUR was named best radio station in St. Louis of 2003 by the Riverfront Times despite the fact that its signal reaches only a few blocks beyond the boundaries of the campus . There are 11 fraternities and 9 sororities , with approximately 35 % of the student body being involved in Greek life . The Congress of the South 40 ( CS40 ) is a Residential Life and Events Programming Board , which operates outside of the SU sphere . CS40 's funding comes from the Housing Activities Fee of each student living on the South 40 .
The British divided Florida into the two colonies of British East Florida and British West Florida . The British government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the French and Indian War in order to encourage settlement . In order to induce settlers to move to the two new colonies reports of the natural wealth of Florida were published in England . A large number of British colonists who were " energetic and of good character " moved to Florida , mostly coming from South Carolina , Georgia and England though there was also a group of settlers who came from the colony of Bermuda . This would be the first permanent English-speaking population in what is now Duval County , Baker County , St. Johns County and Nassau County . The British built good public roads and introduced the cultivation of sugar cane , indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber .
To Secure These Rights also called for desegregation of the Armed Forces . " Prejudice in any area is an ugly , undemocratic phenomenon , but in the armed services , where all men run the risk of death , it is especially repugnant . " The rationale was fairness : " When an individual enters the service of the country , he necessarily surrenders some of the rights and privileges which are inherent in American citizenship . " In return , the government " undertakes to protect his integrity as an individual . " Yet that was not possible in the segregated Army , since " any discrimination which…prevents members of the minority groups from rendering full military service in defense of their country is for them a humiliating badge of inferiority . " The report called for an end to " all discrimination and segregation based on race , color , creed , or national origins in…all branches of the Armed Services . " :38–39
After the formation of the People 's Republic of China in 1949 , the Chinese government named the Western nations , led by the United States , as the biggest threat to its national security . Basing this judgment on China 's century of humiliation beginning in the early 19th century , American support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War , and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries , the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States ' crusade against Communism . As a countermeasure and to elevate China 's standing among the worldwide Communist movements , the Chinese leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China 's periphery .
In October 2014 , Beyoncé signed a deal to launch an activewear line of clothing with British fashion retailer Topshop . The 50-50 venture is called Parkwood Topshop Athletic Ltd and is scheduled to launch its first dance , fitness and sports ranges in autumn 2015 . The line will launch in April 2016 .
Seattle 's foreign-born population grew 40 % between the 1990 and 2000 censuses . The Chinese population in the Seattle area has origins in mainland China , Hong Kong , Southeast Asia , and Taiwan . The earliest Chinese-Americans that came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were almost entirely from Guangdong province . The Seattle area is also home to a large Vietnamese population of more than 55,000 residents , as well as over 30,000 Somali immigrants . The Seattle-Tacoma area is also home to one of the largest Cambodian communities in the United States , numbering about 19,000 Cambodian Americans , and one of the largest Samoan communities in the mainland U.S. , with over 15,000 people having Samoan ancestry . Additionally , the Seattle area had the highest percentage of self-identified mixed-race people of any large metropolitan area in the United States , according to the 2000 United States Census Bureau . According to a 2012 HistoryLink study , Seattle 's 98118 ZIP code ( in the Columbia City neighborhood ) was one of the most diverse ZIP Code Tabulation Areas in the United States .
Burma continues to be used in English by the governments of many countries , such as Australia , Canada and the United Kingdom . Official United States policy retains Burma as the country 's name , although the State Department 's website lists the country as " Burma ( Myanmar ) " and Barack Obama has referred to the country by both names . The Czech Republic uses officially Myanmar , although its Ministry of Foreign Affairs mentions both Myanmar and Burma on its website . The United Nations uses Myanmar , as do the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , Russia , Germany , China , India , Norway , and Japan .
Key personnel involved in the flight deck include the shooters , the handler , and the air boss . Shooters are naval aviators or Naval Flight Officers and are responsible for launching aircraft . The handler works just inside the island from the flight deck and is responsible for the movement of aircraft before launching and after recovery . The " air boss " ( usually a commander ) occupies the top bridge ( Primary Flight Control , also called primary or the tower ) and has the overall responsibility for controlling launch , recovery and " those aircraft in the air near the ship , and the movement of planes on the flight deck , which itself resembles a well-choreographed ballet . " The captain of the ship spends most of his time one level below primary on the Navigation Bridge . Below this is the Flag Bridge , designated for the embarked admiral and his staff .
Northwestern 's football team has made 73 appearances in the top 10 of the AP poll since 1936 ( including 5 at # 1 ) and has won eight Big Ten conference championships since 1903 . At one time , Northwestern had the longest losing streak in Division I-A , losing 34 consecutive games between 1979 and 1982 . They did not appear in a bowl game after 1949 until the 1996 Rose Bowl . The team did not win a bowl since the 1949 Rose Bowl until the 2013 Gator Bowl . Following the sudden death of football coach Randy Walker in 2006 , 31-year-old former All-American Northwestern linebacker Pat Fitzgerald assumed the position , becoming the youngest Division I FBS coach at the time .
The league 's 2016 schedule , announced on the league 's website on December 10 , 2015 , shows an eight-team league playing a 16-game regular season over 18 weeks , with two bye weeks for each team , one on a rotational basis and the other a " universal bye " for all teams during the Independence Day weekend , the first weekend in July . All teams will qualify for the postseason , meaning that the regular season will serve only to establish seeding .
Cubism and modern European art was introduced into the United States at the now legendary 1913 Armory Show in New York City , which then traveled to Chicago and Boston . In the Armory show Pablo Picasso exhibited La Femme au pot de moutarde ( 1910 ) , the sculpture Head of a Woman ( Fernande ) ( 1909–10 ) , Les Arbres ( 1907 ) amongst other cubist works . Jacques Villon exhibited seven important and large drypoints , his brother Marcel Duchamp shocked the American public with his painting Nude Descending a Staircase , No . 2 ( 1912 ) . Francis Picabia exhibited his abstractions La Danse à la source and La Procession , Seville ( both of 1912 ) . Albert Gleizes exhibited La Femme aux phlox ( 1910 ) and L'Homme au balcon ( 1912 ) , two highly stylized and faceted cubist works . Georges Braque , Fernand Léger , Raymond Duchamp-Villon , Roger de La Fresnaye and Alexander Archipenko also contributed examples of their cubist works .
In the early 21st century , Republican voters control most of the state , especially in the more rural and suburban areas outside of the cities ; Democratic strength is mostly confined to the urban cores of the four major cities , and is particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis . The latter area includes a large African-American population . Historically , Republicans had their greatest strength in East Tennessee before the 1960s . Tennessee 's 1st and 2nd congressional districts , based in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville , respectively , are among the few historically Republican districts in the South . Those districts ' residents supported the Union over the Confederacy during the Civil War ; they identified with the GOP after the war and have stayed with that party ever since . The 1st has been in Republican hands continuously since 1881 , and Republicans ( or their antecedents ) have held it for all but four years since 1859 . The 2nd has been held continuously by Republicans or their antecedents since 1859 .
The dogs ' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures . Dogs perform many roles for people , such as hunting , herding , pulling loads , protection , assisting police and military , companionship , and , more recently , aiding handicapped individuals . This impact on human society has given them the nickname " man 's best friend " in the Western world . In some cultures , however , dogs are also a source of meat .
Throughout their history , Slavs came into contact with non-Slavic groups . In the postulated homeland region ( present-day Ukraine ) , they had contacts with the Iranic Sarmatians and the Germanic Goths . After their subsequent spread , they began assimilating non-Slavic peoples . For example , in the Balkans , there were Paleo-Balkan peoples , such as Romanized and Hellenized ( Jireček Line ) Illyrians , Thracians and Dacians , as well as Greeks and Celtic Scordisci . Over time , due to the larger number of Slavs , most descendants of the indigenous populations of the Balkans were Slavicized . The Thracians and Illyrians vanished from the population during this period – although the modern Albanian nation claims descent from the Illyrians . Exceptions are Greece , where the lesser numbered Slavs scattered there came to be Hellenized ( aided in time by more Greeks returning to Greece in the 9th century and the role of the church and administration ) and Romania where Slavic people settled en route for present-day Greece , Republic of Macedonia , Bulgaria and East Thrace whereby the Slavic population had come to assimilate . Bulgars were also assimilated by local Slavs but their ruling status and subsequent land cast the nominal legacy of Bulgarian country and people onto all future generations . The Romance speakers within the fortified Dalmatian cities managed to retain their culture and language for a long time , as Dalmatian Romance was spoken until the high Middle Ages . However , they too were eventually assimilated into the body of Slavs .
In June , 1998 Sammy Sosa exploded into the pursuit of Roger Maris ' home run record . Sosa had 13 home runs entering the month , representing less than half of Mark McGwire 's total . Sosa had his first of four multi-home run games that month on June 1 , and went on to break Rudy York 's record with 20 home runs in the month , a record that still stands . By the end of his historic month , the outfielder 's 33 home runs tied him with Ken Griffey , Jr. and left him only four behind McGwire 's 37 . Sosa finished with 66 and won the NL MVP Award .
The first amniotes apparently arose in the Late Carboniferous . They descended from earlier reptiliomorph amphibious tetrapods , which lived on land that was already inhabited by insects and other invertebrates as well as by ferns , mosses and other plants . Within a few million years , two important amniote lineages became distinct : the synapsids , which would later include the common ancestor of the mammals ; and the sauropsids , which would eventually come to include turtles , lizards , snakes , crocodilians , dinosaurs and birds . Synapsids have a single hole ( temporal fenestra ) low on each side of the skull .
The Compact of Free Association with the United States gives the U.S. sole responsibility for international defense of the Marshall Islands . It allows islanders to live and work in the United States and establishes economic and technical aid programs .
Nontrinitarians , such as Unitarians , Christadelphians and Jehovah 's Witnesses also acknowledge Mary as the biological mother of Jesus Christ , but do not recognise Marian titles such as " Mother of God " as these groups generally reject Christ 's divinity . Since Nontrinitarian churches are typically also mortalist , the issue of praying to Mary , whom they would consider " asleep " , awaiting resurrection , does not arise . Emanuel Swedenborg says God as he is in himself could not directly approach evil spirits to redeem those spirits without destroying them ( Exodus 33:20 , John 1:18 ) , so God impregnated Mary , who gave Jesus Christ access to the evil heredity of the human race , which he could approach , redeem and save .
Another significant change undergone by many of these newly agrarian communities was one of diet . Pre-agrarian diets varied by region , season , available local plant and animal resources and degree of pastoralism and hunting . Post-agrarian diet was restricted to a limited package of successfully cultivated cereal grains , plants and to a variable extent domesticated animals and animal products . Supplementation of diet by hunting and gathering was to variable degrees precluded by the increase in population above the carrying capacity of the land and a high sedentary local population concentration . In some cultures , there would have been a significant shift toward increased starch and plant protein . The relative nutritional benefits and drawbacks of these dietary changes and their overall impact on early societal development is still debated .
In the 1930s , record companies began issuing collections of 78 rpm records by one performer or of one type of music in specially assembled albums , typically with artwork on the front cover and liner notes on the back or inside cover . Most albums included three or four records , with two sides each , making six or eight tunes per album . When the 12-inch vinyl LP era began in 1949 , the single record often had the same or similar number of tunes as a typical album of 78s , and was still often referred to as an " album " .
In 1961 , Nasser sought to firmly establish Egypt as the leader of the Arab world and to promote a second revolution in Egypt with the purpose of merging Islamic and socialist thinking . To achieve this , he initiated several reforms to modernize al-Azhar , which serves as the de facto leading authority in Sunni Islam , and to ensure its prominence over the Muslim Brotherhood and the more conservative Wahhabism promoted by Saudi Arabia . Nasser had used al-Azhar 's most willing ulema ( scholars ) as a counterweight to the Brotherhood 's Islamic influence , starting in 1953 .
Gautama first went to study with famous religious teachers of the day , and mastered the meditative attainments they taught . But he found that they did not provide a permanent end to suffering , so he continued his quest . He next attempted an extreme asceticism , which was a religious pursuit common among the śramaṇas , a religious culture distinct from the Vedic one . Gautama underwent prolonged fasting , breath-holding , and exposure to pain . He almost starved himself to death in the process . He realized that he had taken this kind of practice to its limit , and had not put an end to suffering . So in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach . He devoted himself to anapanasati meditation , through which he discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way ( Skt . madhyamā-pratipad ) : a path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification .

The German materialist and atheist anthropologist Ludwig Feuerbach would signal a new turn in materialism through his book , The Essence of Christianity ( 1841 ) , which provided a humanist account of religion as the outward projection of man 's inward nature . Feuerbach 's materialism would later heavily influence Karl Marx .
Most mammals are viviparous , giving birth to live young . However , the five species of monotreme , the platypuses and the echidnas , lay eggs . The monotremes have a sex determination system different from that of most other mammals . In particular , the sex chromosomes of a platypus are more like those of a chicken than those of a therian mammal . Like marsupials and most other mammals , monotreme young are larval and fetus-like , as the presence of epipubic bones prevents the expansion of the torso , forcing them to produce small young .
The Traymore Hotel was located at the corner of Illinois Avenue and the boardwalk . Begun in 1879 as a small boarding house , the hotel grew through a series of uncoordinated expansions . By 1914 , the hotel 's owner , Daniel White , taking a hint from the Marlborough-Blenheim , commissioned the firm of Price and McLanahan to build an even bigger hotel . Rising 16 stories , the tan brick and gold-capped hotel would become one of the city 's best-known landmarks . The hotel made use of ocean-facing hotel rooms by jutting its wings farther from the main portion of the hotel along Pacific Avenue .
An important element in Estonia 's post-independence reorientation has been closer ties with the Nordic countries , especially Finland and Sweden . Indeed , Estonians consider themselves a Nordic people rather than Balts , based on their historical ties with Sweden , Denmark and particularly Finland . In December 1999 , then Estonian foreign minister ( and since 2006 , president of Estonia ) Toomas Hendrik Ilves delivered a speech entitled " Estonia as a Nordic Country " to the Swedish Institute for International Affairs . In 2003 , the foreign ministry also hosted an exhibit called " Estonia : Nordic with a Twist " .
While full-time work hinders schooling , empirical evidence is varied on the relationship between part-time work and school . Sometimes even part-time work may hinder school attendance or performance . On the other hand , many poor children work for resources to attend school . Children who are not doing well at school sometimes seek more satisfactory experience in work . Good relations with a supervisor at work can provide relief from tensions that children feel at school and home . In the modern world , school education has become so central to society that schoolwork has become the dominant work for most children , often replacing participation in productive work . If school curricula or quality do not provide children with appropriate skills for available jobs or if children do nor have the aptitude for schoolwork , school may impede the learning of skills , such as agriculture , which will become necessary for future livelihood .
An unauthorized user gaining physical access to a computer is most likely able to directly download data from it . They may also compromise security by making operating system modifications , installing software worms , keyloggers , or covert listening devices . Even when the system is protected by standard security measures , these may be able to be by passed by booting another operating system or tool from a CD-ROM or other bootable media . Disk encryption and Trusted Platform Module are designed to prevent these attacks .
In 1935 , Reza Shah requested the international community to refer to the country by its native name , Iran . As the New York Times explained at the time , " At the suggestion of the Persian Legation in Berlin , the Tehran government , on the Persian New Year , Nowruz , March 21 , 1935 , substituted Iran for Persia as the official name of the country . " Opposition to the name change led to the reversal of the decision , and Professor Ehsan Yarshater , editor of Encyclopædia Iranica , propagated a move to use Persia and Iran interchangeably . Today , both Persia and Iran are used in cultural contexts ; although , Iran is the name used officially in political contexts .
In 1981 , The Times and The Sunday Times were bought from Thomson by Rupert Murdoch 's News International . The acquisition followed three weeks of intensive bargaining with the unions by company negotiators , John Collier and Bill O'Neill .
Shortly after the unification of the region , the Western Jin dynasty collapsed . First the rebellions by eight Jin princes for the throne and later rebellions and invasion from Xiongnu and other nomadic peoples that destroyed the rule of the Jin dynasty in the north . In 317 , remnants of the Jin court , as well as nobles and wealthy families , fled from the north to the south and reestablished the Jin court in Nanjing , which was then called Jiankang ( 建康 ) , replacing Luoyang . It 's the first time that the capital of the nation moved to southern part .
The adolescent growth spurt is a rapid increase in the individual 's height and weight during puberty resulting from the simultaneous release of growth hormones , thyroid hormones , and androgens . Males experience their growth spurt about two years later , on average , than females . During their peak height velocity ( the time of most rapid growth ) , adolescents grow at a growth rate nearly identical to that of a toddler—about 4 inches ( 10.3 cm ) a year for males and 3.5 inches ( 9 cm ) for females . In addition to changes in height , adolescents also experience a significant increase in weight ( Marshall , 1978 ) . The weight gained during adolescence constitutes nearly half of one 's adult body weight . Teenage and early adult males may continue to gain natural muscle growth even after puberty .
Visual anthropology is concerned , in part , with the study and production of ethnographic photography , film and , since the mid-1990s , new media . While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film , visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation , including areas such as performance , museums , art , and the production and reception of mass media . Visual representations from all cultures , such as sandpaintings , tattoos , sculptures and reliefs , cave paintings , scrimshaw , jewelry , hieroglyphics , paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology .
Vinyl 's lower surface noise level than shellac was not forgotten , nor was its durability . In the late 1930s , radio commercials and pre-recorded radio programs being sent to disc jockeys started being stamped in vinyl , so they would not break in the mail . In the mid-1940s , special DJ copies of records started being made of vinyl also , for the same reason . These were all 78 rpm . During and after World War II , when shellac supplies were extremely limited , some 78 rpm records were pressed in vinyl instead of shellac , particularly the six-minute 12-inch ( 30 cm ) 78 rpm records produced by V-Disc for distribution to United States troops in World War II . In the 1940s , radio transcriptions , which were usually on 16-inch records , but sometimes 12-inch , were always made of vinyl , but cut at 33 1⁄3 rpm . Shorter transcriptions were often cut at 78 rpm .
The discovery and isolation of radium in uranium ore ( pitchblende ) by Marie Curie sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium , which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials . This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product , since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium . This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry , making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant . Besides the pottery glazes , uranium tile glazes accounted for the bulk of the use , including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green , yellow , mauve , black , blue , red and other colors .
In October 1919 , Albert went up to Trinity College , Cambridge , where he studied history , economics and civics for a year . On 4 June 1920 , he was created Duke of York , Earl of Inverness and Baron Killarney . He began to take on more royal duties . He represented his father , and toured coal mines , factories , and railyards . Through such visits he acquired the nickname of the " Industrial Prince " . His stammer , and his embarrassment over it , together with his tendency to shyness , caused him to appear much less impressive than his older brother , Edward . However , he was physically active and enjoyed playing tennis . He played at Wimbledon in the Men 's Doubles with Louis Greig in 1926 , losing in the first round . He developed an interest in working conditions , and was President of the Industrial Welfare Society . His series of annual summer camps for boys between 1921 and 1939 brought together boys from different social backgrounds .
Slavery and slaves were part of the social order ; there were slave markets where they could be bought and sold . Many slaves were freed by the masters for services rendered ; some slaves could save money to buy their freedom . Generally , mutilation and murder of slaves was prohibited by legislation . However , Rome did not have a law enforcement arm . All actions were treated as " torts , " which were brought by an accuser who was forced to prove the entire case himself . If the accused were a noble and the victim , not a noble , the likelihood of finding for the accused was small . At most , the accused might have to pay a fine for killing a slave . It is estimated that over 25 % of the Roman population was enslaved .
Advaita literally means " not two , sole , unity " . It is a sub-school of Vedanta , and asserts spiritual and universal non-dualism . Its metaphysics is a form of absolute monism , that is all ultimate reality is interconnected oneness . This is the oldest and most widely acknowledged Vedantic school . The foundational texts of this school are the Brahma Sutras and the early Upanishads from the 1st millennium BCE . Its first great consolidator was the 8th century scholar Adi Shankara , who continued the line of thought of the Upanishadic teachers , and that of his teacher 's teacher Gaudapada . He wrote extensive commentaries on the major Vedantic scriptures and is celebrated as one of the major Hindu philosophers from whose doctrines the main currents of modern Indian thought are derived .
In the mid 1970s , various American groups ( some with ties to Downtown Manhattan 's punk scene , including Television and Suicide ) had begun expanding on the vocabulary of punk music . Midwestern groups such as Pere Ubu and Devo drew inspiration from the region 's derelict industrial environments , employing conceptual art techniques , musique concrète and unconventional verbal styles that would presage the post-punk movement by several years . A variety of subsequent groups , including New York-based Talking Heads and Boston-based Mission of Burma , combined elements of punk with art school sensibilities . In 1978 , the former band began a series of collaborations with British ambient pioneer and ex-Roxy Music member Brian Eno , experimenting with Dada-influenced lyrical techniques , dance music , and African polyrhythms . San Francisco 's vibrant post-punk scene was centered around such groups as Chrome , the Residents and Tuxedomoon , who incorporated multimedia experimentation , film and ideas from Antonin Artaud 's Theater of Cruelty .
The Unorganized Borough has no government of its own , but the U.S. Census Bureau in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation . A recording district is a mechanism for administration of the public record in Alaska . The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State Recorder . All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria , fee schedule , etc. , for accepting documents into the public record .
The Cork accent , part of the Southwest dialect of Hiberno-English , displays various features which set it apart from other accents in Ireland . Patterns of tone and intonation often rise and fall , with the overall tone tending to be more high-pitched than other Irish accents . English spoken in Cork has a number of dialect words that are peculiar to the city and environs . Like standard Hiberno-English , some of these words originate from the Irish language , but others through other languages Cork 's inhabitants encountered at home and abroad . The Cork accent displays varying degrees of rhoticity , usually depending on the social-class of the speaker .
Despite Tom 's conviction , Bob Ewell is humiliated by the events of the trial , Atticus explaining that he " destroyed [ Ewell 's ] last shred of credibility at that trial . " Ewell vows revenge , spitting in Atticus ' face , trying to break into the judge 's house , and menacing Tom Robinson 's widow . Finally , he attacks the defenseless Jem and Scout while they walk home on a dark night after the school Halloween pageant . One of Jem 's arms is broken in the struggle , but amid the confusion someone comes to the children 's rescue . The mysterious man carries Jem home , where Scout realizes that he is Boo Radley .
Chopin 's successes as a composer and performer opened the door to western Europe for him , and on 2 November 1830 , he set out , in the words of Zdzisław Jachimecki , " into the wide world , with no very clearly defined aim , forever . " With Woyciechowski , he headed for Austria , intending to go on to Italy . Later that month , in Warsaw , the November 1830 Uprising broke out , and Woyciechowski returned to Poland to enlist . Chopin , now alone in Vienna , was nostalgic for his homeland , and wrote to a friend , " I curse the moment of my departure . " When in September 1831 he learned , while travelling from Vienna to Paris , that the uprising had been crushed , he expressed his anguish in the pages of his private journal : " Oh God ! ... You are there , and yet you do not take vengeance ! " Jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer 's maturing " into an inspired national bard who intuited the past , present and future of his native Poland . "
In southeast Asian colonies , such as Hong Kong , child labour such as the Mui Tsai ( 妹仔 ) , was rationalised as a cultural tradition and ignored by British authorities . The Dutch East India Company officials rationalised their child labour abuses with , " it is a way to save these children from a worse fate . " Christian mission schools in regions stretching from Zambia to Nigeria too required work from children , and in exchange provided religious education , not secular education . Elsewhere , the Canadian Dominion Statutes in form of so-called Breaches of Contract Act , stipulated jail terms for uncooperative child workers .
Oklahoma City was home to several pioneers in radio and television broadcasting . Oklahoma City 's WKY Radio was the first radio station transmitting west of the Mississippi River and the third radio station in the United States . WKY received its federal license in 1921 and has continually broadcast under the same call letters since 1922 . In 1928 , WKY was purchased by E.K . Gaylord 's Oklahoma Publishing Company and affiliated with the NBC Red Network ; in 1949 , WKY-TV ( channel 4 ) went on the air and later became the first independently owned television station in the U.S. to broadcast in color . In mid-2002 , WKY radio was purchased outright by Citadel Broadcasting , who was bought out by Cumulus Broadcasting in 2011 . The Gaylord family earlier sold WKY-TV in 1976 , which has gone through a succession of owners ( what is now KFOR-TV is currently owned by Tribune Broadcasting as of December 2013 ) .
The City Planning Commission , tasked with guiding growth and development of the city , has divided the city into 18 planning districts as part of the Philadelphia2035 physical development plan . Much of the city 's 1980 zoning code was overhauled from 2007–2012 as part of a joint effort between former mayors John F. Street and Michael Nutter . The zoning changes were intended to rectify incorrect zoning mapping that would streamline future community preferences and development , which the city forecasts an additional 100,000 residents and 40,000 jobs to be added to Philadelphia in 2035 .
The Middle Ages is one of the three major periods in the most enduring scheme for analysing European history : classical civilisation , or Antiquity ; the Middle Ages ; and the Modern Period .
Many communities have small air taxi services . These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas . Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane . The world 's busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood , located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport , where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers , cargo , and many items from stores and warehouse clubs . In 2006 Alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any U.S. state .
Alternative proposals for the etymology of *Slověninъ propounded by some scholars have much less support . Lozinski argues that the word *slava once had the meaning of worshipper , in this context meaning " practicer of a common Slavic religion , " and from that evolved into an ethnonym . S.B . Bernstein speculates that it derives from a reconstructed Proto-Indo-European * ( s ) lawos , cognate to Ancient Greek λαός laós " population , people , " which itself has no commonly accepted etymology . Meanwhile , others have pointed out that the suffix -enin indicates a man from a certain place , which in this case should be a place called Slova or Slava , possibly a river name . The Old East Slavic Slavuta for the Dnieper River was argued by Henrich Bartek ( 1907–1986 ) to be derived from slova and also the origin of Slovene .
Standard 35mm photographic film used for cinema projection has a much higher image resolution than HDTV systems , and is exposed and projected at a rate of 24 frames per second ( frame/s ) . To be shown on standard television , in PAL-system countries , cinema film is scanned at the TV rate of 25 frame/s , causing a speedup of 4.1 percent , which is generally considered acceptable . In NTSC-system countries , the TV scan rate of 30 frame/s would cause a perceptible speedup if the same were attempted , and the necessary correction is performed by a technique called 3:2 Pulldown : Over each successive pair of film frames , one is held for three video fields ( 1/20 of a second ) and the next is held for two video fields ( 1/30 of a second ) , giving a total time for the two frames of 1/12 of a second and thus achieving the correct average film frame rate .
Earthworms are Oligochaetes that support terrestrial food chains both as prey and in some regions are important in aeration and enriching of soil . The burrowing of marine polychaetes , which may constitute up to a third of all species in near-shore environments , encourages the development of ecosystems by enabling water and oxygen to penetrate the sea floor . In addition to improving soil fertility , annelids serve humans as food and as bait . Scientists observe annelids to monitor the quality of marine and fresh water . Although blood-letting is no longer in favor with doctors , some leech species are regarded as endangered species because they have been over-harvested for this purpose in the last few centuries . Ragworms ' jaws are now being studied by engineers as they offer an exceptional combination of lightness and strength .
It 's generally accepted that there are around 750 verses in the Quran dealing with natural phenomenon . In many of these verses the study of nature is " encouraged and highly recommended , " and historical Islamic scientists like Al-Biruni and Al-Battani derived their inspiration from verses of the Quran . Mohammad Hashim Kamali has the stated that " scientific observation , experimental knowledge and rationality " are the primary tools with which humanity can achieve the goals laid out for it in the Quran . Ziauddin Sardar built a case for Muslims having developed the foundations of modern science , by highlighting the repeated calls of the Quran to observe and reflect upon natural phenomenon . " The 'scientific method , ' as it is understood today , was first developed by Muslim scientists " like Ibn al-Haytham and Al-Biruni , along with numerous other Muslim scientists .
Early work in molecular genetics suggested the model that one gene makes one protein . This model has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing .
Bohr also introduced the quantity , now known as the reduced Planck constant , as the quantum of angular momentum . At first , Bohr thought that this was the angular momentum of each electron in an atom : this proved incorrect and , despite developments by Sommerfeld and others , an accurate description of the electron angular momentum proved beyond the Bohr model . The correct quantization rules for electrons – in which the energy reduces to the Bohr model equation in the case of the hydrogen atom – were given by Heisenberg 's matrix mechanics in 1925 and the Schrödinger wave equation in 1926 : the reduced Planck constant remains the fundamental quantum of angular momentum . In modern terms , if J is the total angular momentum of a system with rotational invariance , and Jz the angular momentum measured along any given direction , these quantities can only take on the values
It has been revealed that Southampton has the worst behaved secondary schools within the UK . With suspension rates three times the national average , the suspension rate is approximately 1 in every 14 children , the highest in the country for physical or verbal assaults against staff .
Illustrated humour periodicals were popular in 19th-century Britain , the earliest of which was the short-lived The Glasgow Looking Glass in 1825 . The most popular was Punch , which popularized the term cartoon for its humorous caricatures . On occasion the cartoons in these magazines appeared in sequences ; the character Ally Sloper featured in the earliest serialized comic strip when the character began to feature in its own weekly magazine in 1884 .
The NES Test Station 's front features a Game Pak slot and connectors for testing various components ( AC adapter , RF switch , Audio/Video cable , NES Control Deck , accessories and games ) , with a centrally-located selector knob to chose which component to test . The unit itself weighs approximately 11.7 pounds without a TV . It connects to a television via a combined A/V and RF Switch cable . By actuating the green button , a user can toggle between an A/V Cable or RF Switch connection . The television it is connected to ( typically 11 " to 14 " ) is meant to be placed atop it .
From the 9th century , the Pecheneg nomads began an uneasy relationship with Kievan Rus′ . For over two centuries they launched sporadic raids into the lands of Rus′ , which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars ( such as the 920 war on the Pechenegs by Igor of Kiev reported in the Primary Chronicle ) , but there were also temporary military alliances ( e.g . the 943 Byzantine campaign by Igor ) . In 968 , the Pechenegs attacked and besieged the city of Kiev . Some speculation exists that the Pechenegs drove off the Tivertsi and the Ulichs to the regions of the upper Dniester river in Bukovina . The Byzantine Empire was known to support the Pechenegs in their military campaigns against the Eastern Slavic states . [ citation needed ]
The newer micro-USB receptacles are designed for a minimum rated lifetime of 10,000 cycles of insertion and removal between the receptacle and plug , compared to 1,500 for the standard USB and 5,000 for the mini-USB receptacle . Features intended to accomplish include , a locking device was added and the leaf-spring was moved from the jack to the plug , so that the most-stressed part is on the cable side of the connection . This change was made so that the connector on the less expensive cable would bear the most wear instead of the more expensive micro-USB device . However the idea that these changes did in fact make the connector more durable in real world use has been widely disputed , with many contending that they are in fact , much less durable .
So-called voiced aspirated consonants are nearly always pronounced instead with breathy voice , a type of phonation or vibration of the vocal folds . The modifier letter ⟨◌ʰ⟩ after a voiced consonant actually represents a breathy-voiced or murmured dental stop , as with the " voiced aspirated " bilabial stop ⟨bʰ⟩ in the Indo-Aryan languages . This consonant is therefore more accurately transcribed as ⟨b̤⟩ , with the diacritic for breathy voice , or with the modifier letter ⟨bʱ⟩ , a superscript form of the symbol for the voiced glottal fricative ⟨ɦ⟩ .
In his 1884 article William James argued that feelings and emotions were secondary to physiological phenomena . In his theory , James proposed that the perception of what he called an " exciting fact " directly led to a physiological response , known as " emotion . " To account for different types of emotional experiences , James proposed that stimuli trigger activity in the autonomic nervous system , which in turn produces an emotional experience in the brain . The Danish psychologist Carl Lange also proposed a similar theory at around the same time , and therefore this theory became known as the James–Lange theory . As James wrote , " the perception of bodily changes , as they occur , is the emotion . " James further claims that " we feel sad because we cry , angry because we strike , afraid because we tremble , and neither we cry , strike , nor tremble because we are sorry , angry , or fearful , as the case may be . "
In modern Iran , he is considered a national icon , and is often regarded as one of the greatest Persians to have ever lived . A monument was erected outside the Bukhara museum [ year needed ] . The Avicenna Mausoleum and Museum in Hamadan was built in 1952 . Bu-Ali Sina University in Hamadan ( Iran ) , Avicenna Research Institute in Tehran ( Iran ) , the ibn Sīnā Tajik State Medical University in Dushanbe , Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences at Aligarh , India , Avicenna School in Karachi and Avicenna Medical College in Lahore , Pakistan Ibne Sina Balkh Medical School in his native province of Balkh in Afghanistan , Ibni Sina Faculty Of Medicine of Ankara University Ankara , Turkey and Ibn Sina Integrated School in Marawi City ( Philippines ) are all named in his honour . His portrait hangs in the Hall of the Avicenna Faculty of Medicine in the University of Paris . There is also a crater on the Moon named Avicenna and a plant genus Avicennia .
Like most other regions of central and southern Germany , Thuringia has a significant industrial sector reaching back to the mid-19th-century industrialisation . The economic transition after the German reunification in 1990 led to the closure of most large-scale factories and companies , leaving small and medium-sized ones to dominate the manufacturing sector . Well-known industrial centres are Jena ( a world centre for optical instruments with companies like Carl Zeiss , Schott and Jenoptik ) and Eisenach , where BMW started its car production in the 1920s and an Opel factory is based today . The most important industrial branches today are engineering and metalworking , vehicle production and food industries . Especially the small and mid-sized towns in central and southwestern Thuringia ( e.g . Arnstadt , Schmalkalden and Ohrdruf ) are highly industrialised , whereas there are fewer industrial companies in the northern and eastern parts of the Land . Traditional industries like production of glass , porcelain and toys collapsed during the economic crises between 1930 and 1990 .
The 2000 U.S. Census in the write-in response category had a code listing which standardizes the placement of various write-in responses for automatic placement within the framework of the U.S. Census 's enumerated races . Whereas most responses can be distinguished as falling into one of the five enumerated races , there remains some write-in responses which fall into the " Mixture " heading which can not be racially categorized . These include " Bi Racial , Combination , Everything , Many , Mixed , Multi National , Multiple , Several and Various " .
From around 750 , during the Abbasid Caliphate , women “became renowned for their brains as well as their beauty” . In particular , many well known women of the time were trained from childhood in music , dancing and poetry . Mahbuba was one of these . Another feminine figure to be remembered for her achievements was Tawaddud , " a slave girl who was said to have been bought at great cost by Hārūn al-Rashīd because she had passed her examinations by the most eminent scholars in astronomy , medicine , law , philosophy , music , history , Arabic grammar , literature , theology and chess " . Moreover , among the most prominent feminine figures was Shuhda who was known as " the Scholar " or " the Pride of Women " during the 12th century in Baghdad . Despite the recognition of women 's aptitudes during the Abbasid dynasty , all these came to an end in Iraq with the sack of Baghdad in 1258 .
Lack of meaningful alternatives , such as affordable schools and quality education , according to ILO , is another major factor driving children to harmful labour . Children work because they have nothing better to do . Many communities , particularly rural areas where between 60–70 % of child labour is prevalent , do not possess adequate school facilities . Even when schools are sometimes available , they are too far away , difficult to reach , unaffordable or the quality of education is so poor that parents wonder if going to school is really worth it .
After the Spanish in the 16th century , the first permanent European settlers of North Carolina were English colonists who migrated south from Virginia . The latter had grown rapidly and land was less available . Nathaniel Batts was documented as one of the first of these Virginian migrants . He settled south of the Chowan River and east of the Great Dismal Swamp in 1655 . By 1663 , this northeastern area of the Province of Carolina , known as the Albemarle Settlements , was undergoing full-scale English settlement . During the same period , the English monarch Charles II gave the province to the Lords Proprietors , a group of noblemen who had helped restore Charles to the throne in 1660 . The new province of " Carolina " was named in honor and memory of King Charles I ( Latin : Carolus ) . In 1712 , North Carolina became a separate colony . Except for the Earl Granville holdings , it became a royal colony seventeen years later . A large revolt happened in the state in 1711 known as Cary 's Rebellion .
To begin with , England had no permanent home stadium . They joined FIFA in 1906 and played their first ever games against countries other than the Home Nations on a tour of Central Europe in 1908 . Wembley Stadium was opened in 1923 and became their home ground . The relationship between England and FIFA became strained , and this resulted in their departure from FIFA in 1928 , before they rejoined in 1946 . As a result , they did not compete in a World Cup until 1950 , in which they were beaten in a 1–0 defeat by the United States , failing to get past the first round in one of the most embarrassing defeats in the team 's history .
Much of the cuisine of former Ottoman territories today is descended from a shared Ottoman cuisine , especially Turkish cuisine , and including Greek cuisine , Balkan cuisine , Armenian cuisine , and Middle Eastern cuisine . Many common dishes in the region , descendants of the once-common Ottoman cuisine , include yogurt , döner kebab/gyro/shawarma , cacık/tzatziki , ayran , pita bread , feta cheese , baklava , lahmacun , moussaka , yuvarlak , köfte/keftés/kofta , börek/boureki , rakı/rakia/tsipouro/tsikoudia , meze , dolma , sarma , rice pilaf , Turkish coffee , sujuk , kashk , keşkek , manti , lavash , kanafeh , and more .
State banquets also take place in the Ballroom ; these formal dinners are held on the first evening of a state visit by a foreign head of state . On these occasions , for up to 170 guests in formal " white tie and decorations " , including tiaras , the dining table is laid with the Grand Service , a collection of silver-gilt plate made in 1811 for the Prince of Wales , later George IV . The largest and most formal reception at Buckingham Palace takes place every November when the Queen entertains members of the diplomatic corps . On this grand occasion , all the state rooms are in use , as the royal family proceed through them , beginning at the great north doors of the Picture Gallery . As Nash had envisaged , all the large , double-mirrored doors stand open , reflecting the numerous crystal chandeliers and sconces , creating a deliberate optical illusion of space and light .
In 1997 , Queen returned to the studio to record " No-One but You ( Only the Good Die Young ) " , a song dedicated to Mercury and all those that die too soon . It was released as a bonus track on the Queen Rocks compilation album later that year . In January 1997 , Queen performed " The Show Must Go On " live with Elton John and the Béjart Ballet in Paris on a night Mercury was remembered , and it marked the last performance and public appearance of John Deacon , who chose to retire . The Paris concert was only the second time Queen had played live since Mercury 's death , prompting Elton John to urge them to perform again .
After just 100 hours of ground combat , and with all of Kuwait and much of southern Iraq under coalition control , US President George H. W. Bush ordered a cease-fire and negotiations began resulting in an agreement for cessation of hostilities . Some US politicians were disappointed by this move , believing Bush should have pressed on to Baghdad and removed Hussein from power ; there is little doubt that coalition forces could have accomplished this if they had desired . Still , the political ramifications of removing Hussein would have broadened the scope of the conflict greatly , and many coalition nations refused to participate in such an action , believing it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region .
One of Hyderabad 's earliest newspapers , The Deccan Times , was established in the 1780s . In modern times , the major Telugu dailies published in Hyderabad are Eenadu , Andhra Jyothy , Sakshi and Namaste Telangana , while the major English papers are The Times of India , The Hindu and The Deccan Chronicle . The major Urdu papers include The Siasat Daily , The Munsif Daily and Etemaad . Many coffee table magazines , professional magazines and research journals are also regularly published . The Secunderabad Cantonment Board established the first radio station in Hyderabad State around 1919 . Deccan Radio was the first radio public broadcast station in the city starting on 3 February 1935 , with FM broadcasting beginning in 2000 . The available channels in Hyderabad include All India Radio , Radio Mirchi , Radio City , Red FM and Big FM .
Gladstone returned to power after the 1892 general election ; he was 82 years old . Victoria objected when Gladstone proposed appointing the Radical MP Henry Labouchere to the Cabinet , so Gladstone agreed not to appoint him . In 1894 , Gladstone retired and , without consulting the outgoing prime minister , Victoria appointed Lord Rosebery as prime minister . His government was weak , and the following year Lord Salisbury replaced him . Salisbury remained prime minister for the remainder of Victoria 's reign .
The new peace would only last for two years ; war recommenced in the aftermath of John 's decision in August 1200 to marry Isabella of Angoulême . In order to remarry , John first needed to abandon Isabel , Countess of Gloucester , his first wife ; John accomplished this by arguing that he had failed to get the necessary papal permission to marry Isabel in the first place – as a cousin , John could not have legally wed her without this . It remains unclear why John chose to marry Isabella of Angoulême . Contemporary chroniclers argued that John had fallen deeply in love with Isabella , and John may have been motivated by desire for an apparently beautiful , if rather young , girl . On the other hand , the Angoumois lands that came with Isabella were strategically vital to John : by marrying Isabella , John was acquiring a key land route between Poitou and Gascony , which significantly strengthened his grip on Aquitaine .

Red is one of the most common colors used on national flags . The use of red has similar connotations from country to country : the blood , sacrifice , and courage of those who defended their country ; the sun and the hope and warmth it brings ; and the sacrifice of Christ 's blood ( in some historically Christian nations ) are a few examples . Red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the former British Empire . The British flag bears the colors red , white , and blue ; it includes the cross of Saint George , patron saint of England , and the saltire of Saint Patrick , patron saint of Ireland , both of which are red on white . The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain , the colors of the French tricolore include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms , and other countries ' flags , such as those of Australia , New Zealand , and Fiji , carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country . Many former colonies of Spain , such as Mexico , Colombia , Ecuador , Cuba , Puerto Rico , Peru , and Venezuela , also feature red-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners . Red flags are also used to symbolize storms , bad water conditions , and many other dangers . Navy flags are often red and yellow . Red is prominently featured in the flag of the United States Marine Corps .
Prior to the rally , seven anti-China protestors were arrested in Hanoi after unfurling a banner and shouting " Boycott the Beijing Olympics " through a loudhailer at a market . A Vietnamese American was deported for planning protests against the torch , while a prominent blogger , Điếu Cày ( real name Nguyễn Văn Hải ) , who blogged about protests around the world and who called for demonstrations in Vietnam , was arrested on charges of tax evasion . Outside Vietnam , there were protests by overseas Vietnamese in Paris , San Francisco and Canberra . Lê Minh Phiếu , a torchbearer who is a Vietnamese law student studying in France , wrote a letter to the president of the International Olympic Committee protesting China 's " politicisation of the Olympics " , citing maps of the torch relay at the official Beijing Olympic website depicting the disputed islands as Chinese territory and posted it on his blog . One day before the relay was to start , the official website appeared to have been updated to remove the disputed islands and dotted lines marking China 's maritime claims in the South China Sea .
John Knox ( 1505–1572 ) , a Scot who had spent time studying under Calvin in Geneva , returned to Scotland and urged his countrymen to reform the Church in line with Calvinist doctrines . After a period of religious convulsion and political conflict culminating in a victory for the Protestant party at the Siege of Leith the authority of the Church of Rome was abolished in favour of Reformation by the legislation of the Scottish Reformation Parliament in 1560 . The Church was eventually organised by Andrew Melville along Presbyterian lines to become the national Church of Scotland . King James VI and I moved the Church of Scotland towards an episcopal form of government , and in 1637 , James ' successor , Charles I and William Laud , the Archbishop of Canterbury , attempted to force the Church of Scotland to use the Book of Common Prayer . What resulted was an armed insurrection , with many Scots signing the Solemn League and Covenant . The Covenanters would serve as the government of Scotland for nearly a decade , and would also send military support to the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War . Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 , Charles II , despite the initial support that he received from the Covenanters , reinstated an episcopal form of government on the church .
Suffering ( Pāli : दुक्ख dukkha ; Sanskrit दुःख duḥkha ) is also a central concept in Buddhism . The word roughly corresponds to a number of terms in English including suffering , pain , unsatisfactoriness , sorrow , affliction , anxiety , dissatisfaction , discomfort , anguish , stress , misery , and frustration . Although the term is often translated as " suffering " , its philosophical meaning is more analogous to " disquietude " as in the condition of being disturbed . As such , " suffering " is too narrow a translation with " negative emotional connotations " [ web 9 ] that can give the impression that the Buddhist view is pessimistic , but Buddhism seeks to be neither pessimistic nor optimistic , but realistic . In English-language Buddhist literature translated from Pāli , " dukkha " is often left untranslated , so as to encompass its full range of meaning . [ note 8 ]
Some new immigrants arrived as refugees with no possessions and were housed in temporary camps known as ma'abarot ; by 1952 , over 200,000 immigrants were living in these tent cities . During this period , food , clothes and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the Austerity Period . The need to solve the crisis led Ben-Gurion to sign a reparations agreement with West Germany that triggered mass protests by Jews angered at the idea that Israel could accept monetary compensation for the Holocaust .
Citizens were organized on the basis of centuries and tribes , which would each gather into their own assemblies . The Comitia Centuriata ( " Centuriate Assembly " ) was the assembly of the centuries ( i.e . soldiers ) . The president of the Comitia Centuriata was usually a consul . The centuries would vote , one at a time , until a measure received support from a majority of the centuries . The Comitia Centuriata would elect magistrates who had imperium powers ( consuls and praetors ) . It also elected censors . Only the Comitia Centuriata could declare war , and ratify the results of a census . It also served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases .
According to Mahayana tradition , the Mahayana sutras were transmitted in secret , came from other Buddhas or Bodhisattvas , or were preserved in non-human worlds because human beings at the time could not understand them :
In 1877 , the Protestant James Cameron from the China Inland Mission walked from Chongqing to Batang in Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture , Sichuan province , and " brought the Gospel to the Tibetan people . " Beginning in the 20th century , in Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan , a large number of Lisu people and some Yi and Nu people converted to Christianity . Famous earlier missionaries include James O. Fraser , Alfred James Broomhall and Isobel Kuhn of the China Inland Mission , among others who were active in this area .
In 1968 Ronald Melzack and Kenneth Casey described pain in terms of its three dimensions : " sensory-discriminative " ( sense of the intensity , location , quality and duration of the pain ) , " affective-motivational " ( unpleasantness and urge to escape the unpleasantness ) , and " cognitive-evaluative " ( cognitions such as appraisal , cultural values , distraction and hypnotic suggestion ) . They theorized that pain intensity ( the sensory discriminative dimension ) and unpleasantness ( the affective-motivational dimension ) are not simply determined by the magnitude of the painful stimulus , but " higher " cognitive activities can influence perceived intensity and unpleasantness . Cognitive activities " may affect both sensory and affective experience or they may modify primarily the affective-motivational dimension . Thus , excitement in games or war appears to block both dimensions of pain , while suggestion and placebos may modulate the affective-motivational dimension and leave the sensory-discriminative dimension relatively undisturbed . " ( p. 432 ) The paper ends with a call to action : " Pain can be treated not only by trying to cut down the sensory input by anesthetic block , surgical intervention and the like , but also by influencing the motivational-affective and cognitive factors as well . " ( p. 435 )
Music is cherished in Boston . The Boston Symphony Orchestra is one of the " Big Five , " a group of the greatest American orchestras , and the classical music magazine Gramophone called it one of the " world 's best " orchestras . Symphony Hall ( located west of Back Bay ) is home to the Boston Symphony Orchestra , ( and the related Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra , which is the largest youth orchestra in the nation ) and the Boston Pops Orchestra . The British newspaper The Guardian called Boston Symphony Hall " one of the top venues for classical music in the world , " adding that " Symphony Hall in Boston was where science became an essential part of concert hall design . " Other concerts are held at the New England Conservatory 's Jordan Hall . The Boston Ballet performs at the Boston Opera House . Other performing-arts organizations located in the city include the Boston Lyric Opera Company , Opera Boston , Boston Baroque ( the first permanent Baroque orchestra in the US ) , and the Handel and Haydn Society ( one of the oldest choral companies in the United States ) . The city is a center for contemporary classical music with a number of performing groups , several of which are associated with the city 's conservatories and universities . These include the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Boston Musica Viva . Several theaters are located in or near the Theater District south of Boston Common , including the Cutler Majestic Theatre , Citi Performing Arts Center , the Colonial Theater , and the Orpheum Theatre .
In September 1998 , the Fraunhofer Institute sent a letter to several developers of MP3 software stating that a license was required to " distribute and/or sell decoders and/or encoders " . The letter claimed that unlicensed products " infringe the patent rights of Fraunhofer and Thomson . To make , sell and/or distribute products using the [ MPEG Layer-3 ] standard and thus our patents , you need to obtain a license under these patents from us . "
Teenager Sanjaya Malakar was the season 's most talked-about contestant for his unusual hairdo , and for managing to survive elimination for many weeks due in part to the weblog Vote for the Worst and satellite radio personality Howard Stern , who both encouraged fans to vote for him . However , on April 18 , Sanjaya was voted off .
Antarctica has no indigenous population and there is no evidence that it was seen by humans until the 19th century . However , belief in the existence of a Terra Australis—a vast continent in the far south of the globe to " balance " the northern lands of Europe , Asia and North Africa—had existed since the times of Ptolemy ( 1st century AD ) , who suggested the idea to preserve the symmetry of all known landmasses in the world . Even in the late 17th century , after explorers had found that South America and Australia were not part of the fabled " Antarctica " , geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size .
According to the same study , even though digital piracy inflicts additional costs on the production side of media , it also offers the main access to media goods in developing countries . The strong tradeoffs that favor using digital piracy in developing economies dictate the current neglected law enforcements toward digital piracy . In China , the issue of digital infringement is not merely legal , but social – originating from the high demand for cheap and affordable goods as well as the governmental connections of the businesses which produce such goods .
West 's third studio album , Graduation , garnered major publicity when its release date pitted West in a sales competition against rapper 50 Cent 's Curtis . Upon their September 2007 releases , Graduation outsold Curtis by a large margin , debuting at number one on the U.S . Billboard 200 chart and selling 957,000 copies in its first week . Graduation once again continued the string of critical and commercial successes by West , and the album 's lead single , " Stronger " , garnered the rapper his third number-one hit . " Stronger " , which samples French house duo Daft Punk , has been accredited to not only encouraging other hip-hop artists to incorporate house and electronica elements into their music , but also for playing a part in the revival of disco and electro-infused music in the late 2000s . Ben Detrick of XXL cited the outcome of the sales competition between 50 Cent 's Curtis and West 's Graduation as being responsible for altering the direction of hip-hop and paving the way for new rappers who did n't follow the hardcore-gangster mold , writing , " If there was ever a watershed moment to indicate hip-hop 's changing direction , it may have come when 50 Cent competed with Kanye in 2007 to see whose album would claim superior sales .

Many of Boston 's medical facilities are associated with universities . The facilities in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area and in Massachusetts General Hospital are affiliated with Harvard Medical School . Tufts Medical Center ( formerly Tufts-New England Medical Center ) , located in the southern portion of the Chinatown neighborhood , is affiliated with Tufts University School of Medicine . Boston Medical Center , located in the South End neighborhood , is the primary teaching facility for the Boston University School of Medicine as well as the largest trauma center in the Boston area ; it was formed by the merger of Boston University Hospital and Boston City Hospital , which was the first municipal hospital in the United States .
Tajikistan 's rivers , such as the Vakhsh and the Panj , have great hydropower potential , and the government has focused on attracting investment for projects for internal use and electricity exports . Tajikistan is home to the Nurek Dam , the highest dam in the world . Lately , Russia 's RAO UES energy giant has been working on the Sangtuda-1 hydroelectric power station ( 670 MW capacity ) commenced operations on 18 January 2008 . Other projects at the development stage include Sangtuda-2 by Iran , Zerafshan by the Chinese company SinoHydro , and the Rogun power plant that , at a projected height of 335 metres ( 1,099 ft ) , would supersede the Nurek Dam as highest in the world if it is brought to completion . A planned project , CASA 1000 , will transmit 1000 MW of surplus electricity from Tajikistan to Pakistan with power transit through Afghanistan . The total length of transmission line is 750 km while the project is planned to be on Public-Private Partnership basis with the support of WB , IFC , ADB and IDB . The project cost is estimated to be around US $ 865 million . Other energy resources include sizable coal deposits and smaller reserves of natural gas and petroleum .
In 1933 , von Neumann was offered a lifetime professorship on the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study when the institute 's plan to appoint Hermann Weyl fell through . He remained a mathematics professor there until his death , although he announced that shortly before his intention to resign and become a professor at large at the University of California . His mother , brothers and in-laws followed John to the United States in 1939 . Von Neumann anglicized his first name to John , keeping the German-aristocratic surname of von Neumann . His brothers changed theirs to " Neumann " and " Vonneumann " . Von Neumann became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1937 , and immediately tried to become a lieutenant in the United States Army 's Officers Reserve Corps . He passed the exams easily , but was ultimately rejected because of his age . His prewar analysis is often quoted . Asked about how France would stand up to Germany he said " Oh , France wo n't matter . "
San Diego and its backcountry are subject to periodic wildfires . In October 2003 , San Diego was the site of the Cedar Fire , which has been called the largest wildfire in California over the past century . The fire burned 280,000 acres ( 1,100 km2 ) , killed 15 people , and destroyed more than 2,200 homes . In addition to damage caused by the fire , smoke resulted in a significant increase in emergency room visits due to asthma , respiratory problems , eye irritation , and smoke inhalation ; the poor air quality caused San Diego County schools to close for a week . Wildfires four years later destroyed some areas , particularly within the communities of Rancho Bernardo , Rancho Santa Fe , and Ramona .
Physical pain is an important political topic in relation to various issues , including pain management policy , drug control , animal rights or animal welfare , torture , and pain compliance . In various contexts , the deliberate infliction of pain in the form of corporal punishment is used as retribution for an offence , or for the purpose of disciplining or reforming a wrongdoer , or to deter attitudes or behaviour deemed unacceptable . In some cultures , extreme practices such as mortification of the flesh or painful rites of passage are highly regarded .
Most wrestling matches last for a set number of falls , with the first side to achieve the majority number of pinfalls , submissions , or countouts being the winner . Historically , matches were wrestled to 3 falls ( " best 2 out of 3 " ) or 5 falls ( " best 3 out of 5 " ) . The standard for modern matches is one fall . However , even though it is now standard , many announcers will explicitly state this ( e.g . " The following contest is set for one fall with a 20-minute time limit " ) . These matches are given a time limit ; if not enough falls are scored by the end of the time limit , the match is declared a draw . Modern matches are generally given a 10- to 30-minute time limit for standard matches ; title matches can go for up to one hour . British wrestling matches held under Admiral-Lord Mountevans rules are 2 out of 3 falls .
Besides emptiness , Mahayana schools often place emphasis on the notions of perfected spiritual insight ( prajñāpāramitā ) and Buddha-nature ( tathāgatagarbha ) . There are conflicting interpretations of the tathāgatagarbha in Mahāyāna thought . The idea may be traced to Abhidharma , and ultimately to statements of the Buddha in the Nikāyas . In Tibetan Buddhism , according to the Sakya school , tathāgatagarbha is the inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one 's mind . In Nyingma , tathāgatagarbha also generally refers to inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one 's mind . According to the Gelug school , it is the potential for sentient beings to awaken since they are empty ( i.e . dependently originated ) . According to the Jonang school , it refers to the innate qualities of the mind that expresses themselves as omniscience etc . when adventitious obscurations are removed . The " Tathāgatagarbha Sutras " are a collection of Mahayana sutras that present a unique model of Buddha-nature . Even though this collection was generally ignored in India , East Asian Buddhism provides some significance to these texts .

White then commits suicide . Bond locates Swann at the Hoffler Klinik , but she is abducted by Hinx . Bond rescues her and the two meet Q , who discovers that Sciarra 's ring links Oberhauser to Bond 's previous missions , identifying Le Chiffre , Dominic Greene and Raoul Silva as Spectre agents . Swann reveals that L'Américain is a hotel in Tangier .
The Saharan cheetah ( northwest African cheetah ) lives in Algeria , Togo , Niger , Mali , Benin , and Burkina Faso . There remain fewer than 250 mature cheetahs , which are very cautious , fleeing any human presence . The cheetah avoids the sun from April to October , seeking the shelter of shrubs such as balanites and acacias . They are unusually pale . The other cheetah subspecies ( northeast African cheetah ) lives in Chad , Sudan and the eastern region of Niger . However , it is currently extinct in the wild of Egypt and Libya . They are approximately 2,000 mature individuals left in the wild .
Domestically , Barcelona has won 23 La Liga , 27 Copa del Rey , 11 Supercopa de España , 3 Copa Eva Duarte and 2 Copa de la Liga trophies , as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions . In international club football , Barcelona has won five UEFA Champions League titles , a record four UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup , a shared record five UEFA Super Cup , a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and a record three FIFA Club World Cup trophies . Barcelona was ranked first in the IFFHS Club World Ranking for 1997 , 2009 , 2011 , 2012 and 2015 and currently occupies the second position on the UEFA club rankings . The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid ; matches between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico .
The Soviet Union created the Eastern Bloc of countries that it occupied , annexing some as Soviet Socialist Republics and maintaining others as satellite states that would later form the Warsaw Pact . The United States and various western European countries began a policy of " containment " of communism and forged myriad alliances to this end , including NATO . Several of these western countries also coordinated efforts regarding the rebuilding of western Europe , including western Germany , which the Soviets opposed . In other regions of the world , such as Latin America and Southeast Asia , the Soviet Union fostered communist revolutionary movements , which the United States and many of its allies opposed and , in some cases , attempted to " roll back " . Many countries were prompted to align themselves with the nations that would later form either NATO or the Warsaw Pact , though other movements would also emerge .
Of the 10 most populous U.S. cities , Houston has the most total area of parks and green space , 56,405 acres ( 228 km2 ) . The city also has over 200 additional green spaces—totaling over 19,600 acres ( 79 km2 ) that are managed by the city—including the Houston Arboretum and Nature Center . The Lee and Joe Jamail Skatepark is a public skatepark owned and operated by the city of Houston , and is one of the largest skateparks in Texas consisting of 30,000 ( 2,800 m2 ) square foot in-ground facility . The Gerald D. Hines Waterwall Park—located in the Uptown District of the city—serves as a popular tourist attraction , weddings , and various celebrations . A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Houston the 23rd most walkable of the 50 largest cities in the United States . Wet'n'Wild SplashTown is a water park located north of Houston .
The final name for the republic during the Soviet era was adopted by the Russian Constitution of 1937 , which renamed it the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic .
Greece has universal compulsory military service for males , while females are exempted from conscription but may otherwise serve in the military . As of 2009 [ update ] , mandatory military service is nine months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45 . Additionally , Greek males between the age of 18 and 60 who live in strategically sensitive areas may be required to serve part-time in the National Guard . However , as the military has sought to become a completely professional force , the government has promised to reduce mandatory military service or abolish it completely .
Diarrhea , also spelled diarrhoea , is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day . It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss . Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour . This can progress to decreased urination , loss of skin color , a fast heart rate , and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe . Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are breastfed , however , may be normal .
Under the doctrine of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins ( 1938 ) , there is no general federal common law . Although federal courts can create federal common law in the form of case law , such law must be linked one way or another to the interpretation of a particular federal constitutional provision , statute , or regulation ( which in turn was enacted as part of the Constitution or after ) . Federal courts lack the plenary power possessed by state courts to simply make up law , which the latter are able to do in the absence of constitutional or statutory provisions replacing the common law . Only in a few narrow limited areas , like maritime law , has the Constitution expressly authorized the continuation of English common law at the federal level ( meaning that in those areas federal courts can continue to make law as they see fit , subject to the limitations of stare decisis ) .
In 1865 , when the Bell family moved to London , Bell returned to Weston House as an assistant master and , in his spare hours , continued experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment . Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a telegraph wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend . Throughout late 1867 , his health faltered mainly through exhaustion . His younger brother , Edward " Ted , " was similarly bed-ridden , suffering from tuberculosis . While Bell recovered ( by then referring to himself in correspondence as " A.G. Bell " ) and served the next year as an instructor at Somerset College , Bath , England , his brother 's condition deteriorated . Edward would never recover . Upon his brother 's death , Bell returned home in 1867 . His older brother Melville had married and moved out . With aspirations to obtain a degree at University College London , Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations , devoting his spare time at his family 's residence to studying .
Although it was Russia that was punished by the Paris Treaty , in the long run it was Austria that lost the most from the Crimean War despite having barely taken part in it . :433 Having abandoned its alliance with Russia , Austria was diplomatically isolated following the war , :433 which contributed to its disastrous defeats in the 1859 Franco-Austrian War that resulted in the cession of Lombardy to the Kingdom of Sardinia , and later in the loss of the Habsburg rule of Tuscany and Modena , which meant the end of Austrian influence in Italy . Furthermore , Russia did not do anything to assist its former ally , Austria , in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War:433 with its loss of Venetia and more important than that , its influence in most German-speaking lands . The status of Austria as a great power , with the unifications of Germany and Italy was now severely questioned . It had to compromise with Hungary , the two countries shared the Danubian Empire and Austria slowly became a little more than a German satellite . With France now hostile to Germany , allied with Russia , and Russia competing with the newly renamed Austro-Hungarian Empire for an increased role in the Balkans at the expense of the Ottoman Empire , the foundations were in place for creating the diplomatic alliances that would lead to World War I .
Axons transmit signals to other neurons by means of specialized junctions called synapses . A single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells . When an action potential , traveling along an axon , arrives at a synapse , it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released . The neurotransmitter binds to receptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell .
The new Supreme Court of New Zealand was officially established at the beginning of 2004 , although it did not come into operation until July . The High Court of New Zealand was until 1980 known as the Supreme Court . The Supreme Court has a purely appellate jurisdiction and hears appeals from the Court of Appeal of New Zealand . In some cases , an appeal may be removed directly to the Supreme Court from the High Court . For certain cases , particularly cases which commenced in the District Court , a lower court ( typically the High Court or the Court of Appeal ) may be the court of final jurisdiction .
Tibet has some of the world 's tallest mountains , with several of them making the top ten list . Mount Everest , located on the border with Nepal , is , at 8,848 metres ( 29,029 ft ) , the highest mountain on earth . Several major rivers have their source in the Tibetan Plateau ( mostly in present-day Qinghai Province ) . These include the Yangtze , Yellow River , Indus River , Mekong , Ganges , Salween and the Yarlung Tsangpo River ( Brahmaputra River ) . The Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon , along the Yarlung Tsangpo River , is among the deepest and longest canyons in the world .
Portuguese cinema has a long tradition , reaching back to the birth of the medium in the late 19th century . Portuguese film directors such as Arthur Duarte , António Lopes Ribeiro , António Reis , Pedro Costa , Manoel de Oliveira , João César Monteiro , António-Pedro Vasconcelos , Fernando Lopes , João Botelho and Leonel Vieira , are among those that gained notability . Noted Portuguese film actors include Joaquim de Almeida , Daniela Ruah , Maria de Medeiros , Diogo Infante , Soraia Chaves , Ribeirinho , Lúcia Moniz , and Diogo Morgado .
Title VII was perhaps the most controversial of the entire bill . Many conservatives accused it of advocating a de facto quota system , and claimed unconstitutionality as it attempts to regulate the workplace . Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey corrected this notion : " there is nothing in [ Title VII ] that will give power to the Commission to require hiring , firing , and promotion to meet a racial 'quota . ' [ . . . ] Title VII is designed to encourage the hiring on basis of ability and qualifications , not race or religion . " Title VII prohibits discrimination . Humphrey was the silent hero of the bill 's passing through Congress . He pledged that the bill required no quotas , just nondiscrimination . Doing so , he convinced many pro-business Republicans , including Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen ( IL ) to support Title VII . :78–80
Arsenal reached the final of the 2007 and 2011 League Cups , losing 2–1 to Chelsea and Birmingham City respectively . The club had not gained a major trophy since the 2005 FA Cup until 17 May 2014 , when Arsenal beat Hull City in the 2014 FA Cup Final , coming back from a 2–0 deficit to win the match 3–2 . This qualified them for the 2014 FA Community Shield where they would play Premier League champions Manchester City . They recorded a resounding 3–0 win in the game , winning their second trophy in three months . Nine months after their Community Shield triumph , Arsenal appeared in the FA Cup final for the second year in a row , thrashing Aston Villa 4–0 in the final and becoming the most successful club in the tournament 's history with 12 titles . On 2 August 2015 , Arsenal beat Chelsea 1–0 at Wembley Stadium to retain the Community Shield and earn their 14th Community Shield title .
King County Metro provides frequent stop bus service within the city and surrounding county , as well as a South Lake Union Streetcar line between the South Lake Union neighborhood and Westlake Center in downtown . Seattle is one of the few cities in North America whose bus fleet includes electric trolleybuses . Sound Transit currently provides an express bus service within the metropolitan area ; two Sounder commuter rail lines between the suburbs and downtown ; its Central Link light rail line , which opened in 2009 , between downtown and Sea-Tac Airport gives the city its first rapid transit line that has intermediate stops within the city limits . Washington State Ferries , which manages the largest network of ferries in the United States and third largest in the world , connects Seattle to Bainbridge and Vashon Islands in Puget Sound and to Bremerton and Southworth on the Kitsap Peninsula .
Consistent with the missions and priorities outlined above , the Canadian Armed Forces also contribute to the conduct of Canadian defence diplomacy through a range of activities , including the deployment of Canadian Defence Attachés , participation in bilateral and multilateral military forums ( e.g . the System of Cooperation Among the American Air Forces ) , ship and aircraft visits , military training and cooperation , and other such outreach and relationship-building efforts .
After the Nazi Party seized power in January 1933 , the Länder increasingly lost importance . They became administrative regions of a centralised country . Three changes are of particular note : on January 1 , 1934 , Mecklenburg-Schwerin was united with the neighbouring Mecklenburg-Strelitz ; and , by the Greater Hamburg Act ( Groß-Hamburg-Gesetz ) , from April 1 , 1937 , the area of the city-state was extended , while Lübeck lost its independence and became part of the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein .
The editor , Larry Lamb , was originally from a Labour background , with a socialist upbringing while his temporary replacement Bernard Shrimsley ( 1972–75 ) was a middle-class uncommitted Conservative . An extensive advertising campaign on the ITV network in this period , voiced by actor Christopher Timothy , may have helped The Sun to overtake the Daily Mirror 's circulation in 1978 . Despite the industrial relations of the 1970s – the so-called " Spanish practices " of the print unions – The Sun was very profitable , enabling Murdoch to expand his operations to the United States from 1973 .
In 1976 , a group of Italian American professors at City University of New York asked to be added as an affirmative action category for promotion and hiring . Italian Americans are usually considered white in the US and would not be covered under affirmative action policies , but the professors believed they were underrepresented . Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell wrote in his book , Affirmative Action Around the World : An Empirical Study , that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [ i.e. , primary beneficiaries of affirmative action ] to take advantage of group preference policies .
In mid-2015 , several new color schemes for all of the current iPod models were spotted in the latest version of iTunes , 12.2 . Belgian website Belgium iPhone originally found the images when plugging in an iPod for the first time , and subsequent leaked photos were found by Pierre Dandumont .
After the Holocaust , which had been perpetrated by the Nazi Germany and its allies prior to and during World War II , Lemkin successfully campaigned for the universal acceptance of international laws defining and forbidding genocides . In 1946 , the first session of the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution that " affirmed " that genocide was a crime under international law , but did not provide a legal definition of the crime . In 1948 , the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide ( CPPCG ) which defined the crime of genocide for the first time .
Houston was incorporated in 1837 under the ward system of representation . The ward designation is the progenitor of the eleven current-day geographically oriented Houston City Council districts . Locations in Houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside the Interstate 610 Loop . The inside encompasses the central business district and many residential neighborhoods that predate World War II . More recently , high-density residential areas have been developed within the loop . The city 's outlying areas , suburbs and enclaves are located outside of the loop . Beltway 8 encircles the city another 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) farther out .
The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and only in their penalty area . Outfield players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball , but may also use their head or torso to do so instead . The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins . If the score is level at the end of the game , either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition . The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863 . Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football ( FIFA ; French : Fédération Internationale de Football Association ) , which organises World Cups for both men and women every four years .
Spirit possession has been documented in modern Rajasthan . Some of the spirits possessing Rajasthanis are seen as good and beneficial while others are seen as malevolent . The good spirits include murdered royalty , the underworld god Bhaironji , and Muslim saints . Bad spirits include perpetual debtors who die in debt , stillborn infants , deceased widows , and foreign tourists . The possessed individual is referred to as a ghorala ( " mount " ) . Possession , even if it is by a benign spirit , is regarded as undesirable , as it entails loss of self-control and violent emotional outbursts .
Stepper motors are a type of motor frequently used when precise rotations are required . In a stepper motor an internal rotor containing PMs or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched electronically . A stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid . As each coil is energized in turn , the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding . Unlike a synchronous motor , in its application , the stepper motor may not rotate continuously ; instead , it " steps " —starts and then quickly stops again—from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence . Depending on the sequence , the rotor may turn forwards or backwards , and it may change direction , stop , speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time .
Two rounds of Soviet purges directed by Moscow ( 1927–1934 and 1937–1938 ) resulted in the expulsion of nearly 10,000 people , from all levels of the Communist Party of Tajikistan . Ethnic Russians were sent in to replace those expelled and subsequently Russians dominated party positions at all levels , including the top position of first secretary . Between 1926 and 1959 the proportion of Russians among Tajikistan 's population grew from less than 1 % to 13 % . Bobojon Ghafurov , Tajikistan 's First Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan from 1946–1956 was the only Tajikistani politician of significance outside of the country during the Soviet Era . He was followed in office by Tursun Uljabayev ( 1956–61 ) , Jabbor Rasulov ( 1961–1982 ) , and Rahmon Nabiyev ( 1982–1985 , 1991–1992 ) .
The Downtown District is the home of the Third Street Promenade , a major outdoor pedestrian-only shopping district that stretches for three blocks between Wilshire Blvd . and Broadway ( not the same Broadway in downtown and south Los Angeles ) . Third Street is closed to vehicles for those three blocks to allow people to stroll , congregate , shop and enjoy street performers . Santa Monica Place , featuring Bloomingdale 's and Nordstrom in a three-level outdoor environment , is located at the south end of the Promenade . After a period of redevelopment , the mall reopened in the fall of 2010 as a modern shopping , entertainment and dining complex with more outdoor space .
A maakond ( county ) is the biggest administrative subdivision . The county government ( Maavalitsus ) of each county is led by a county governor ( Maavanem ) , who represents the national government at the regional level . Governors are appointed by the Government of Estonia for a term of five years . Several changes were made to the borders of counties after Estonia became independent , most notably the formation of Valga County ( from parts of Võru , Tartu and Viljandi counties ) and Petseri County ( area acquired from Russia with the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty ) .
One-color light is well suited for traffic lights and signals , exit signs , emergency vehicle lighting , ships ' navigation lights or lanterns ( chromacity and luminance standards being set under the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 , Annex I and the CIE ) and LED-based Christmas lights . In cold climates , LED traffic lights may remain snow-covered . Red or yellow LEDs are used in indicator and alphanumeric displays in environments where night vision must be retained : aircraft cockpits , submarine and ship bridges , astronomy observatories , and in the field , e.g . night time animal watching and military field use .
New Haven lies at the intersection of Interstate 95 on the coast—which provides access southwards and/or westwards to the western coast of Connecticut and to New York City , and eastwards to the eastern Connecticut shoreline , Rhode Island , and eastern Massachusetts—and Interstate 91 , which leads northward to the interior of Massachusetts and Vermont and the Canadian border . I-95 is infamous for traffic jams increasing with proximity to New York City ; on the east side of New Haven it passes over the Quinnipiac River via the Pearl Harbor Memorial , or " Q Bridge " , which often presents a major bottleneck to traffic . I-91 , however , is relatively less congested , except at the intersection with I-95 during peak travel times .
Mandolin has also been used in blues music , most notably by Ry Cooder , who performed outstanding covers on his very first recordings , Yank Rachell , Johnny " Man " Young , Carl Martin , and Gerry Hundt . Howard Armstrong , who is famous for blues violin , got his start with his father 's mandolin and played in string bands similar to the other Tennessee string bands he came into contact with , with band makeup including " mandolins and fiddles and guitars and banjos . And once in a while they would ease a little ukulele in there and a bass fiddle . " Other blues players from the era 's string bands include Willie Black ( Whistler And His Jug Band ) , Dink Brister , Jim Hill , Charles Johnson , Coley Jones ( Dallas String Band ) , Bobby Leecan ( Need More Band ) , Alfred Martin , Charlie McCoy ( 1909-1950 ) , Al Miller , Matthew Prater , and Herb Quinn .
The person or organization submits a HCP and if approved by the agency ( FWS or NMFS ) , will be issued an Incidental Take Permit ( ITP ) which allows a certain number of " takes " of the listed species . The permit may be revoked at any time and can allow incidental takes for varying amounts of time . For instance , the San Bruno Habitat Conservation Plan/ Incidental Take Permit is good for 30 years and the Wal-Mart store ( in Florida ) permit expires after one year . Because the permit is issued by a federal agency to a private party , it is a federal action-which means other federal laws can apply , such as the National Environmental Policy Act or NEPA . A notice of the permit application action is published in the Federal Register and a public comment period of 30 to 90 days begins .
The British dealt with range measurement first , when it was realised that range was the key to producing a better fuse setting . This led to the Height/Range Finder ( HRF ) , the first model being the Barr & Stroud UB2 , a 2-metre optical coincident rangefinder mounted on a tripod . It measured the distance to the target and the elevation angle , which together gave the height of the aircraft . These were complex instruments and various other methods were also used . The HRF was soon joined by the Height/Fuse Indicator ( HFI ) , this was marked with elevation angles and height lines overlaid with fuse length curves , using the height reported by the HRF operator , the necessary fuse length could be read off .
A small , landlocked kingdom , Swaziland is bordered in the North , West and South by the Republic of South Africa and by Mozambique in the East . Swaziland has a land area of 17,364 km2 . Swaziland has four separate geographical regions . These run from North to South and are determined by altitude . Swaziland is located at approximately 26°30 'S , 31°30'E . Swaziland has a wide variety of landscapes , from the mountains along the Mozambican border to savannas in the east and rain forest in the northwest . Several rivers flow through the country , such as the Great Usutu River .
Laws were instituted that required every able-bodied male Japanese citizen , regardless of class , to serve a mandatory term of three years with the first reserves and two additional years with the second reserves . This action , the deathblow for the samurai warriors and their daimyo feudal lords , initially met resistance from both the peasant and warrior alike . The peasant class interpreted the term for military service , ketsu-eki ( blood tax ) literally , and attempted to avoid service by any means necessary . The Japanese government began modelling their ground forces after the French military . The French government contributed greatly to the training of Japanese officers . Many were employed at the military academy in Kyoto , and many more still were feverishly translating French field manuals for use in the Japanese ranks .
In the 1920s , John Maynard Keynes prompted a division between microeconomics and macroeconomics . Under Keynesian economics macroeconomic trends can overwhelm economic choices made by individuals . Governments should promote aggregate demand for goods as a means to encourage economic expansion . Following World War II , Milton Friedman created the concept of monetarism . Monetarism focuses on using the supply and demand of money as a method for controlling economic activity . In the 1970s , monetarism has adapted into supply-side economics which advocates reducing taxes as a means to increase the amount of money available for economic expansion .
The town was the subject of an attempt by a separate company , the Didcot , Newbury and Southampton Railway , to open another rail route to the North in the 1880s and some building work , including a surviving embankment , was undertaken in the Hill Lane area .
In a channel transupport system , several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria . It is a simple system , which consists of only three protein subunits : the ABC protein , membrane fusion protein ( MFP ) , and outer membrane protein ( OMP ) [ specify ] . This secretion system transports various molecules , from ions , drugs , to proteins of various sizes ( 20 - 900 kDa ) . The molecules secreted vary in size from the small Escherichia coli peptide colicin V , ( 10 kDa ) to the Pseudomonas fluorescens cell adhesion protein LapA of 900 kDa .
Greenwich Mean Time ( GMT ) is an older standard , adopted starting with British railways in 1847 . Using telescopes instead of atomic clocks , GMT was calibrated to the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory , Greenwich in the UK . Universal Time ( UT ) is the modern term for the international telescope-based system , adopted to replace " Greenwich Mean Time " in 1928 by the International Astronomical Union . Observations at the Greenwich Observatory itself ceased in 1954 , though the location is still used as the basis for the coordinate system . Because the rotational period of Earth is not perfectly constant , the duration of a second would vary if calibrated to a telescope-based standard like GMT or UT—in which a second was defined as a fraction of a day or year . The terms " GMT " and " Greenwich Mean Time " are sometimes used informally to refer to UT or UTC .
A public genome sequencing effort of cotton was initiated in 2007 by a consortium of public researchers . They agreed on a strategy to sequence the genome of cultivated , tetraploid cotton . " Tetraploid " means that cultivated cotton actually has two separate genomes within its nucleus , referred to as the A and D genomes . The sequencing consortium first agreed to sequence the D-genome relative of cultivated cotton ( G. raimondii , a wild Central American cotton species ) because of its small size and limited number of repetitive elements . It is nearly one-third the number of bases of tetraploid cotton ( AD ) , and each chromosome is only present once . [ clarification needed ] The A genome of G. arboreum would be sequenced next . Its genome is roughly twice the size of G. raimondii 's . Part of the difference in size between the two genomes is the amplification of retrotransposons ( GORGE ) . Once both diploid genomes are assembled , then research could begin sequencing the actual genomes of cultivated cotton varieties . This strategy is out of necessity ; if one were to sequence the tetraploid genome without model diploid genomes , the euchromatic DNA sequences of the AD genomes would co-assemble and the repetitive elements of AD genomes would assembly independently into A and D sequences respectively . Then there would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts .
Following the hardliners ' takeover , the September 30 , 1990 elections ( runoffs on October 14 ) were characterized by intimidation ; several Popular Front candidates were jailed , two were murdered , and unabashed ballot stuffing took place even in the presence of Western observers . The election results reflected the threatening environment ; out of the 350 members , 280 were Communists , with only 45 opposition candidates from the Popular Front and other non-communist groups , who together formed a Democratic Bloc ( " Dembloc " ) . In May 1990 Mutalibov was elected Chairman of the Supreme Soviet unopposed .
In 1913 , his father was elevated to the nobility for his service to the Austro-Hungarian Empire by Emperor Franz Joseph . The Neumann family thus acquired the hereditary appellation Margittai , meaning of Marghita . The family had no connection with the town ; the appellation was chosen in reference to Margaret , as was those chosen coat of arms depicting three marguerites . Neumann János became Margittai Neumann János ( John Neumann of Marghita ) , which he later changed to the German Johann von Neumann .
Some biographical accounts include the autobiography Life on the Color Line : The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black by Gregory Howard Williams ; One Drop : My Father 's Hidden Life—A Story of Race and Family Secrets written by Bliss Broyard about her father Anatole Broyard ; the documentary Colored White Boy about a white man in North Carolina who discovers that he is the descendant of a white plantation owner and a raped African slave ; and the documentary on The Sanders Women of Shreveport , Louisiana .
Older constitutions often vest this power in the cabinet . In the United Kingdom , for example , the tradition whereby it is the prime minister who requests a dissolution of parliament dates back to 1918 . Prior to then , it was the entire government that made the request . Similarly , though the modern 1937 Irish constitution grants to the Taoiseach the right to make the request , the earlier 1922 Irish Free State Constitution vested the power in the Executive Council ( the then name for the Irish cabinet ) .
Throughout the Hellenistic world , these Greco-Macedonian colonists considered themselves by and large superior to the native " barbarians " and excluded most non-Greeks from the upper echelons of courtly and government life . Most of the native population was not Hellenized , had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords . Gymnasiums and their Greek education , for example , were for Greeks only . Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus , but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite . The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch . Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways , but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects . In the Seleucid empire for example , this group amounted to only 2.5 percent of the official class .
122nd Street is mentioned in the movie Taxi Driver by main character Travis Bickle as the location where a fellow cab driver is assaulted with a knife . The street and the surrounding neighborhood of Harlem is then referred to as " Mau Mau Land " by another character named Wizard , slang indicating it is a majority black area .
They invented and developed arithmetic by using several different number systems including a mixed radix system with an alternating base 10 and base 6 . This sexagesimal system became the standard number system in Sumer and Babylonia . They may have invented military formations and introduced the basic divisions between infantry , cavalry , and archers . They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems , complete with courts , jails , and government records . The first true city-states arose in Sumer , roughly contemporaneously with similar entities in what are now Syria and Lebanon . Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform , the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for the first time , about 2600 BC , to messages and mail delivery , history , legend , mathematics , astronomical records , and other pursuits . Conjointly with the spread of writing , the first formal schools were established , usually under the auspices of a city-state 's primary temple .
The domination of Estonia after the Northern Crusades , from the 13th century to 1918 by Denmark , Germany , Sweden , and Russia delayed indigenous literacy in Estonia . [ citation needed ]
The 50th anniversary of his death was celebrated on 3 June 2013 by Pope Francis , who visited his tomb and prayed there , then addressing the gathered crowd and spoke about the late pope . The people that gathered there at the tomb were from Bergamo , the province where the late pope came from . A month later , on 5 July 2013 , Francis approved Pope John XXIII for canonization , along with Pope John Paul II without the traditional second miracle required . Instead , Francis based this decision on John XXIII 's merits for the Second Vatican Council . On Sunday , 27 April 2014 , John XXIII and Pope John Paul II were declared saints on Divine Mercy Sunday .
Towards the center , at the end of the groove , there is another wide-pitched section known as the lead-out . At the very end of this section the groove joins itself to form a complete circle , called the lock groove ; when the stylus reaches this point , it circles repeatedly until lifted from the record . On some recordings ( for example Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles , Super Trouper by Abba and Atom Heart Mother by Pink Floyd ) , the sound continues on the lock groove , which gives a strange repeating effect . Automatic turntables rely on the position or angular velocity of the arm , as it reaches the wider spacing in the groove , to trigger a mechanism that lifts the arm off the record . Precisely because of this mechanism , most automatic turntables are incapable of playing any audio in the lock groove , since they will lift the arm before it reaches that groove .
In addition to numerous articles on mathematics , Whitehead wrote three major books on the subject : A Treatise on Universal Algebra ( 1898 ) , Principia Mathematica ( co-written with Bertrand Russell and published in three volumes between 1910 and 1913 ) , and An Introduction to Mathematics ( 1911 ) . The former two books were aimed exclusively at professional mathematicians , while the latter book was intended for a larger audience , covering the history of mathematics and its philosophical foundations . Principia Mathematica in particular is regarded as one of the most important works in mathematical logic of the 20th century .
This article covers numbered east-west streets in Manhattan , New York City . Major streets have their own linked articles ; minor streets are discussed here . The streets do not run exactly east–west , because the grid plan is aligned with the Hudson River rather than with the cardinal directions . " West " is approximately 29 degrees north of true west .
Spectre ( 2015 ) is the twenty-fourth James Bond film produced by Eon Productions . It features Daniel Craig in his fourth performance as James Bond , and Christoph Waltz as Ernst Stavro Blofeld , with the film marking the character 's re-introduction into the series . It was directed by Sam Mendes as his second James Bond film following Skyfall , and was written by John Logan , Neal Purvis , Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth . It is distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures . With a budget around $ 245 million , it is the most expensive Bond film and one of the most expensive films ever made .
New developments in Judaism often transcend differences in religious practice between Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews . In North American cities , social trends such as the chavurah movement , and the emergence of " post-denominational Judaism " often bring together younger Jews of diverse ethnic backgrounds . In recent years , there has been increased interest in Kabbalah , which many Ashkenazi Jews study outside of the Yeshiva framework . Another trend is the new popularity of ecstatic worship in the Jewish Renewal movement and the Carlebach style minyan , both of which are nominally of Ashkenazi origin .
When Emperor Constantine I died , Athanasius was allowed to return to his See of Alexandria . Shortly thereafter , however , Constantine 's son , the new Roman Emperor Constantius II , renewed the order for Athanasius 's banishment in 338 . Athanasius went to Rome , where he was under the protection of Constans , the Emperor of the West . During this time , Gregory of Cappadocia was installed as the Patriarch of Alexandria , usurping the absent Athanasius . Athanasius did , however , remain in contact with his people through his annual Festal Letters , in which he also announced on which date Easter would be celebrated that year .
Although the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other , their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love-hate relationship . Harold C. Schonberg believes that Chopin displayed a " tinge of jealousy and spite " towards Liszt 's virtuosity on the piano , and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt 's theatricality , showmanship and success . Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin 's Op . 10 Études , and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller , " I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies . " However , Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments , at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all , forcing an apology . Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other , although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as " my friend Liszt " . Some commentators point to events in the two men 's romantic lives which led to a rift between them ; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d'Agoult 's obsession with Chopin , while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt 's growing relationship with George Sand .
Race was asked differently in the Census 2000 in several other ways than previously . Most significantly , respondents were given the option of selecting one or more race categories to indicate racial identities . Data show that nearly seven million Americans identified as members of two or more races . Because of these changes , the Census 2000 data on race are not directly comparable with data from the 1990 census or earlier censuses . Use of caution is therefore recommended when interpreting changes in the racial composition of the US population over time .
The NFL Network ceased airing Arena Football League games partway through the 2012 season as a result of ongoing labor problems within the league . Briefly , the games were broadcast on a tape delay to prevent the embarrassment that would result should the players stage a work stoppage immediately prior to a scheduled broadcast . ( In at least once incidence this actually happened , resulting in a non-competitive game being played with replacement players , and further such incidents were threatened . ) Once the labor issues were resolved , the NFL Network resumed the practice of broadcasting a live Friday night game . NFL Network dropped the league at the end of the 2012 season .
At the time of her accession , the government was led by the Whig prime minister Lord Melbourne , who at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced Queen , who relied on him for advice . Charles Greville supposed that the widowed and childless Melbourne was " passionately fond of her as he might be of his daughter if he had one " , and Victoria probably saw him as a father figure . Her coronation took place on 28 June 1838 at Westminster Abbey . Over 400,000 visitors came to London for the celebrations . She became the first sovereign to take up residence at Buckingham Palace and inherited the revenues of the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall as well as being granted a civil list allowance of £385,000 per year . Financially prudent , she paid off her father 's debts .
From Elizabeth 's birth onwards , the British Empire continued its transformation into the Commonwealth of Nations . By the time of her accession in 1952 , her role as head of multiple independent states was already established . In 1953 , the Queen and her husband embarked on a seven-month round-the-world tour , visiting 13 countries and covering more than 40,000 miles by land , sea and air . She became the first reigning monarch of Australia and New Zealand to visit those nations . During the tour , crowds were immense ; three-quarters of the population of Australia were estimated to have seen her . Throughout her reign , the Queen has made hundreds of state visits to other countries and tours of the Commonwealth ; she is the most widely travelled head of state .
There is an extensive network of caves , including Wookey Hole , underground rivers , and gorges , including the Cheddar Gorge and Ebbor Gorge . The county has many rivers , including the Axe , Brue , Cary , Parrett , Sheppey , Tone and Yeo . These both feed and drain the flat levels and moors of mid and west Somerset . In the north of the county the River Chew flows into the Bristol Avon . The Parrett is tidal almost to Langport , where there is evidence of two Roman wharfs . At the same site during the reign of King Charles I , river tolls were levied on boats to pay for the maintenance of the bridge .
Milena Sterio , American expert of international law , includes the former axis powers ( Germany , Italy and Japan ) and India among the great powers along with the permanent members of the UNSC . She considers Germany , Japan and Italy to be great powers due to their G7 membership and because of their influence in regional and international organizations . Various authors describe Italy as an equal major power , while others view Italy as an " intermittent great power " or as " the least of the great powers " .
Following the events in Olympia , there were reports that China requested permission to deploy People 's Liberation Army personnel along the relay route to protect the flame in Canberra . Australian authorities stated that such a request , if it were to be made , would be refused . Chinese officials labeled it a rumor . Australian police have been given powers to search relay spectators , following a call by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association for Chinese Australian students to " go defend our sacred torch " against " ethnic degenerate scum and anti-China separatists " . Tony Goh , chairman of the Australian Council of Chinese Organisations , has said the ACCO would be taking " thousands " of pro-Beijing demonstrators to Canberra by bus , to support the torch relay . Zhang Rongan , a Chinese Australian student organising pro-Beijing demonstrations , told the press that Chinese diplomats were assisting with the organization of buses , meals and accommodation for pro-Beijing demonstrators , and helping them organise a " peaceful show of strength " . Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said Chinese officials were urging supporters to " turn up and put a point of view " , but that he had no objection to it as long as they remained peaceful .
The nitrogen fixing Rhizobia are an interesting case , wherein conjugative elements naturally engage in inter-kingdom conjugation . Such elements as the Agrobacterium Ti or Ri plasmids contain elements that can transfer to plant cells . Transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories for the production of opines , which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources . Infected plant cells form crown gall or root tumors . The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria , which are in turn endosymbionts ( or parasites ) of the infected plant .
Forbes magazine began reporting on Beyoncé 's earnings in 2008 , calculating that the $ 80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008 , for her music , tour , films and clothing line made her the world 's best-paid music personality at the time , above Madonna and Celine Dion . They placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009 and ninth on the " Most Powerful Women in the World " list in 2010 . The following year , Forbes placed her eighth on the " Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30 " list , having earned $ 35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals . In 2012 , Forbes placed Beyoncé at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list , twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $ 40 million in the past year for her album 4 , clothing line and endorsement deals . In the same year , Beyoncé and Jay Z placed at number one on the " World 's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples " , for collectively earning $ 78 million . The couple made it into the previous year 's Guinness World Records as the " highest-earning power couple " for collectively earning $ 122 million in 2009 . For the years 2009 to 2011 , Beyoncé earned an average of $ 70 million per year , and earned $ 40 million in 2012 . In 2013 , Beyoncé 's endorsements of Pepsi and H & M made her and Jay Z the world 's first billion dollar couple in the music industry . That year , Beyoncé was published as the fourth most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings . MTV estimated that by the end of 2014 , Beyoncé would become the highest-paid black musician in history ; she succeeded to do so in April 2014 . In June 2014 , Beyoncé ranked at # 1 on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list , earning an estimated $ 115 million throughout June 2013 – June 2014 . This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date . As of May 2015 , her net worth is estimated to be $ 250 million .
A squab is the name given to the young of domestic pigeons that are destined for the table . Like other domesticated pigeons , birds used for this purpose are descended from the rock pigeon ( Columba livia ) . Special utility breeds with desirable characteristics are used . Two eggs are laid and incubated for about 17 days . When they hatch , the squabs are fed by both parents on " pigeon 's milk " , a thick secretion high in protein produced by the crop . Squabs grow rapidly , but are slow to fledge and are ready to leave the nest at 26 to 30 days weighing about 500 g ( 18 oz ) . By this time , the adult pigeons will have laid and be incubating another pair of eggs and a prolific pair should produce two squabs every four weeks during a breeding season lasting several months .
To the north-east of the Somerset Levels , the Mendip Hills are moderately high limestone hills . The central and western Mendip Hills was designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in 1972 and covers 198 km2 ( 76 sq mi ) . The main habitat on these hills is calcareous grassland , with some arable agriculture . To the south-west of the Somerset Levels are the Quantock Hills which was England 's first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty designated in 1956 which is covered in heathland , oak woodlands , ancient parklands with plantations of conifer and covers 99 square kilometres . The Somerset Coalfield is part of a larger coalfield which stretches into Gloucestershire . To the north of the Mendip hills is the Chew Valley and to the south , on the clay substrate , are broad valleys which support dairy farming and drain into the Somerset Levels .
Of the remaining land area , the state of Alaska owns 101 million acres ( 41 million hectares ) , its entitlement under the Alaska Statehood Act . A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs , under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs . Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities . These are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations . The University of Alaska , as a land grant university , also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently .
A number of vessels visiting the islands were attacked and their crews killed . In 1834 , Captain DonSette and his crew were killed . Similarly , in 1845 the schooner Naiad punished a native for stealing with such violence that the natives attacked the ship . Later that year a whaler 's boat crew were killed . In 1852 the San Francisco-based ships Glencoe and Sea Nymph were attacked and everyone aboard except for one crew member were killed . The violence was usually attributed as a response to the ill treatment of the natives in response to petty theft , which was a common practice . In 1857 , two missionaries successfully settled on Ebon , living among the natives through at least 1870.:3
1853 : There were four main events . 1 . In the north the Turks captured the border fort of Saint Nicholas in a surprise night attack ( 27/28 October ) . They then pushed about 20000 troops across the Cholok River border . Being outnumbered the Russians abandoned Poti and Redut Kale and drew back to Marani . Both sides remained immobile for the next seven months . 2 . In the center the Turks moved north from Ardahan to within cannon-shot of Akhaltsike and awaited reinforcements ( 13 November ) . The Russians routed them . The claimed losses were 4000 Turks and 400 Russians . 3 . In the south about 30000 Turks slowly moved east to the main Russian concentration at Gyumri or Alexandropol ( November ) . They crossed the border and set up artillery south of town . Prince Orbeliani tried to drive them off and found himself trapped . The Turks failed to press their advantage , the remaining Russians rescued Orbeliani and the Turks retired west . Orbeliani lost about 1000 men out of 5000 . The Russians now decided to advance , the Turks took up a strong position on the Kars road and attacked . They were defeated in the battle of Başgedikler , losing 6000 men , half their artillery and all their supply train . The Russians lost 1300 , including Prince Orbeliani . This was Prince Ellico Orbeliani whose wife was later kidnaped by Shamyl at Tsinandali . 4 . At sea the Turks sent a fleet east which was destroyed by Admiral Nakhimov at Sinope .
Smyth , convinced that his self-baptism was invalid , applied with the Mennonites for membership . He died while waiting for membership , and some of his followers became Mennonites . Thomas Helwys and others kept their baptism and their Baptist commitments . The modern Baptist denomination is an outgrowth of Smyth 's movement . Baptists rejected the name Anabaptist when they were called that by opponents in derision . McBeth writes that as late as the 18th century , many Baptists referred to themselves as " the Christians commonly—though falsely—called Anabaptists . "
Architecture ( Latin architectura , from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων arkhitekton " architect " , from ἀρχι- " chief " and τέκτων " builder " ) is both the process and the product of planning , designing , and constructing buildings and other physical structures . Architectural works , in the material form of buildings , are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art . Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements .
The Israel Defense Forces is the sole military wing of the Israeli security forces , and is headed by its Chief of General Staff , the Ramatkal , subordinate to the Cabinet . The IDF consist of the army , air force and navy . It was founded during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War by consolidating paramilitary organizations—chiefly the Haganah—that preceded the establishment of the state . The IDF also draws upon the resources of the Military Intelligence Directorate ( Aman ) , which works with Mossad and Shabak . The Israel Defense Forces have been involved in several major wars and border conflicts in its short history , making it one of the most battle-trained armed forces in the world .
In paintings , Mary is traditionally portrayed in blue . This tradition can trace its origin to the Byzantine Empire , from c.500 AD , where blue was " the colour of an empress " . A more practical explanation for the use of this colour is that in Medieval and Renaissance Europe , the blue pigment was derived from the rock lapis lazuli , a stone imported from Afghanistan of greater value than gold . Beyond a painter 's retainer , patrons were expected to purchase any gold or lapis lazuli to be used in the painting . Hence , it was an expression of devotion and glorification to swathe the Virgin in gowns of blue .
The state has the 12th-largest state economy in Mexico , accounting for 2.7 % of the country’s GDP . Chihuahua has the fifth highest manufacturing GDP in Mexico and ranks second for the most factories funded by foreign investment in the country . As of 2011 [ update ] , the state had an estimated 396 billion pesos ( 31.1 billion dollars ) of annual GDP . According to official federal statistical studies , the service sector accounted for the largest portion of the state economy at 59.28 % ; the manufacturing and industrial sector is estimated to account for 34.36 % of the state 's GDP , with the agricultural sector accounting for 6.36 % of the state 's GDP . Manufacturing sector was the principal foreign investment in the state followed by the mining sector . In 2011 , the state received approximately 884 million dollars in remittances from the United States , which was 4.5 % of all remittances from the United States to Mexico .
The development of a three-field rotation system for planting crops [ AA ] increased the usage of land from one half in use each year under the old two-field system to two-thirds under the new system , with a consequent increase in production . The development of the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently , aided by the spread of the horse collar , which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen . Horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture , factors that aided the implementation of the three-field system .
Some succeeded their fathers as rulers , such as Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur , who ruled Morocco from 1578 to 1608 . He was not technically considered as a mixed-race child of a slave ; his mother was Fulani and a concubine of his father . Such tolerance for black persons , even when technically " free " , was not so common in Morocco . The long association of sub-Saharan peoples as slaves is shown in the term abd ( Arabic : عبد‎ , ) ( meaning " slave " ) ; it is still frequently used in the Arabic-speaking world as a term for black people .
There are also open compression formats like Opus and Vorbis that are available free of charge and without any known patent restrictions . Some of the newer audio compression formats , such as AAC , WMA Pro and Vorbis , are free of some limitations inherent to the MP3 format that can not be overcome by any MP3 encoder .
An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005 , after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before , but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season . UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League , giving England five qualifiers . UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing . However , for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League , this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league , it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league . No association can have more than four entrants in the Champions League . This occurred in 2012 , when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League the previous year , but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur , who went into the Europa League .
Early followers of Whitehead were found primarily at the University of Chicago 's Divinity School , where Henry Nelson Wieman initiated an interest in Whitehead 's work that would last for about thirty years . Professors such as Wieman , Charles Hartshorne , Bernard Loomer , Bernard Meland , and Daniel Day Williams made Whitehead 's philosophy arguably the most important intellectual thread running through the Divinity School . They taught generations of Whitehead scholars , the most notable of which is John B. Cobb , Jr .
The city has several federal facilities , including the John F. Kennedy Federal Office Building , the Thomas P. O'Neill Federal Building , the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit , the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts , and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston .
Though pesticide regulations differ from country to country , pesticides , and products on which they were used are traded across international borders . To deal with inconsistencies in regulations among countries , delegates to a conference of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization adopted an International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides in 1985 to create voluntary standards of pesticide regulation for different countries . The Code was updated in 1998 and 2002 . The FAO claims that the code has raised awareness about pesticide hazards and decreased the number of countries without restrictions on pesticide use .
Beginning in the summer of 54 BC , a wave of political corruption and violence swept Rome . This chaos reached a climax in January of 52 BC , when Clodius was murdered in a gang war by Milo . On 1 January 49 BC , an agent of Caesar presented an ultimatum to the senate . The ultimatum was rejected , and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year , he would be considered an enemy of the Republic . Meanwhile , the senators adopted Pompey as their new champion against Caesar . On 7 January of 49 BC , the senate passed a senatus consultum ultimum , which vested Pompey with dictatorial powers . Pompey 's army , however , was composed largely of untested conscripts . On 10 January , Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his veteran army ( in violation of Roman laws ) and marched towards Rome . Caesar 's rapid advance forced Pompey , the consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece . Caesar entered the city unopposed .
During the Three Kingdoms period of ancient China , there was constant warfare occurring in the Central Plain of China . Northerners began to enter into Fujian region , causing the region to incorporate parts of northern Chinese dialects . However , the massive migration of northern Han Chinese into Fujian region mainly occurred after the Disaster of Yongjia . The Jìn court fled from the north to the south , causing large numbers of northern Han Chinese to move into Fujian region . They brought the old Chinese — spoken in Central Plain of China from prehistoric era to 3rd century — into Fujian . This then gradually evolved into the Quanzhou dialect .
The earliest known use of the phrase Brytish Iles in the English language is dated 1577 in a work by John Dee . Today , this name is seen by some as carrying imperialist overtones although it is still commonly used . Other names used to describe the islands include the Anglo-Celtic Isles , Atlantic archipelago , British-Irish Isles , Britain and Ireland , UK and Ireland , and British Isles and Ireland . Owing to political and national associations with the word British , the Government of Ireland does not use the term British Isles and in documents drawn up jointly between the British and Irish governments , the archipelago is referred to simply as " these islands " . Nonetheless , British Isles is still the most widely accepted term for the archipelago .
The Premier League sends representatives to UEFA 's European Club Association , the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients . For the 2012–13 season the Premier League has 10 representatives in the Association : Arsenal , Aston Villa , Chelsea , Everton , Fulham , Liverpool , Manchester City , Manchester United , Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur . The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA 's Club Competitions Committee , which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League .
During this battle , on September 13 , the 4th Division , under John A. Quitman , spearheaded the attack against Chapultepec and carried the castle . Future Confederate generals George E. Pickett and James Longstreet participated in the attack . Serving in the Mexican defense were the cadets later immortalized as Los Niños Héroes ( the " Boy Heroes " ) . The Mexican forces fell back from Chapultepec and retreated within the city . Attacks on the Belén and San Cosme Gates came afterwards . The treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in what is now the far north of the city .

Another misunderstanding is that , by her immaculate conception , Mary did not need a saviour . When defining the dogma in Ineffabilis Deus , Pope Pius IX explicitly affirmed that Mary was redeemed in a manner more sublime . He stated that Mary , rather than being cleansed after sin , was completely prevented from contracting Original Sin in view of the foreseen merits of Jesus Christ , the Savior of the human race . In Luke 1:47 , Mary proclaims : " My spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour . " This is referred to as Mary 's pre-redemption by Christ . Since the Second Council of Orange against semi-pelagianism , the Catholic Church has taught that even had man never sinned in the Garden of Eden and was sinless , he would still require God 's grace to remain sinless .
Sextus Julius Africanus further refers to the writings of historian Thallus : " This darkness Thallus , in the third book of his History , calls , as appears to me without reason , an eclipse of the sun . For the Hebrews celebrate the passover on the 14th day according to the moon , and the passion of our Saviour falls on the day before the passover ; but an eclipse of the sun takes place only when the moon comes under the sun . " Christian apologist Tertullian believed the event was documented in the Roman archives .
Zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of " exceptional biologic and public health importance " , especially regarding prenatal and postnatal development . Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases . In children it causes growth retardation , delayed sexual maturation , infection susceptibility , and diarrhea . Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry , such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans . Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia , lethargy and copper deficiency .
Many of London 's pubs are known to have been used by famous people , but in some cases , such as the association between Samuel Johnson and Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese , this is speculative , based on little more than the fact that the person is known to have lived nearby . However , Charles Dickens is known to have visited the Cheshire Cheese , the Prospect of Whitby , Ye Olde Cock Tavern and many others . Samuel Pepys is also associated with the Prospect of Whitby and the Cock Tavern .
The Aravalli Range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered . This region is home to the Kathiarbar-Gir dry deciduous forests ecoregion , with tropical dry broadleaf forests that include teak , Acacia , and other trees . The hilly Vagad region , home to the cities of Dungarpur and Banswara lies in southernmost Rajasthan , on the border with Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh . With the exception of Mount Abu , Vagad is the wettest region in Rajasthan , and the most heavily forested . North of Vagad lies the Mewar region , home to the cities of Udaipur and Chittaurgarh . The Hadoti region lies to the southeast , on the border with Madhya Pradesh . North of Hadoti and Mewar lies the Dhundhar region , home to the state capital of Jaipur . Mewat , the easternmost region of Rajasthan , borders Haryana and Uttar Pradesh . Eastern and southeastern Rajasthan is drained by the Banas and Chambal rivers , tributaries of the Ganges .
Based on fossil and biological evidence , most scientists accept that birds are a specialized subgroup of theropod dinosaurs , and more specifically , they are members of Maniraptora , a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids , among others . As scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds , the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred . Recent discoveries in the Liaoning Province of northeast China , which demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaurs , contribute to this ambiguity .
Avialans diversified into a wide variety of forms during the Cretaceous Period . Many groups retained primitive characteristics , such as clawed wings and teeth , though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups , including modern birds ( Aves ) . While the earliest forms , such as Archaeopteryx and Jeholornis , retained the long bony tails of their ancestors , the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened with the advent of the pygostyle bone in the group Pygostylia . In the late Cretaceous , around 95 million years ago , the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a better sense of smell .
The government of the Marshall Islands operates under a mixed parliamentary-presidential system as set forth in its Constitution . Elections are held every four years in universal suffrage ( for all citizens above 18 ) , with each of the twenty-four constituencies ( see below ) electing one or more representatives ( senators ) to the lower house of RMI 's unicameral legislature , the Nitijela . ( Majuro , the capital atoll , elects five senators . ) The President , who is head of state as well as head of government , is elected by the 33 senators of the Nitijela . Four of the five Marshallese presidents who have been elected since the Constitution was adopted in 1979 have been traditional paramount chiefs .
A January 2013 press release from the USB group revealed plans to update USB 3.0 to 10 Gbit/s . The group ended up creating a new USB version , USB 3.1 , which was released on 31 July 2013 , introducing a faster transfer mode called SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbit/s , putting it on par with a single first-generation Thunderbolt channel . The new mode 's logo features a " Superspeed+ " caption ( stylized as SUPERSPEED+ ) . The USB 3.1 standard increases the data signaling rate to 10 Gbit/s in the USB 3.1 Gen2 mode , double that of USB 3.0 ( referred to as USB 3.1 Gen1 ) and reduces line encoding overhead to just 3 % by changing the encoding scheme to 128b/132b . The first USB 3.1 implementation demonstrated transfer speeds of 7.2 Gbit/s .
In domestic dogs , sexual maturity begins to happen around age six to twelve months for both males and females , although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds . This is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle . They will experience subsequent estrous cycles biannually , during which the body prepares for pregnancy . At the peak of the cycle , females will come into estrus , being mentally and physically receptive to copulation . Because the ova survive and are capable of being fertilized for a week after ovulation , it is possible for a female to mate with more than one male .
Likewise the migration of Spanish-speaking Nicaraguans also began as a result of political instability during the end of the 1970s and the 1980s . The uprising of the Sandinista revolution which toppled the Somoza dictatorship in 1979 caused many Nicaraguans to migrate particularly from those opposing the Sandinistas . Throughout the 1980s with the United States supported Contra War ( or Contra-revolutionary war ) which continued up until 1988 , and the economic collapse of the country many more Nicaraguans migrated to the United States amongst other countries . The states of the United States where most Nicaraguans migrated to include Florida , California and Texas .
Letter case is often prescribed by the grammar of a language or by the conventions of a particular discipline . In orthography , the uppercase is primarily reserved for special purposes , such as the first letter of a sentence or of a proper noun , which makes the lowercase the more common variant in text . In mathematics , letter case may indicate the relationship between objects with uppercase letters often representing " superior " objects ( e.g . X could be a set containing the generic member x ) . Engineering design drawings are typically labelled entirely in upper-case letters , which are easier to distinguish than lowercase , especially when space restrictions require that the lettering be small .
Avignon was the seat of the papacy from 1309 to 1376 . With the return of the Pope to Rome in 1378 , the Papal State developed into a major secular power , culminating in the morally corrupt papacy of Alexander VI . Florence grew to prominence amongst the Italian city-states through financial business , and the dominant Medici family became important promoters of the Renaissance through their patronage of the arts . Other city states in northern Italy also expanded their territories and consolidated their power , primarily Milan and Venice . The War of the Sicilian Vespers had by the early 14th century divided southern Italy into an Aragon Kingdom of Sicily and an Anjou Kingdom of Naples . In 1442 , the two kingdoms were effectively united under Aragonese control .
The authors of the study also examined 77 college textbooks in biology and 69 in physical anthropology published between 1932 and 1989 . Physical anthropology texts argued that biological races exist until the 1970s , when they began to argue that races do not exist . In contrast , biology textbooks did not undergo such a reversal but many instead dropped their discussion of race altogether . The authors attributed this to biologists trying to avoid discussing the political implications of racial classifications , instead of discussing them , and to the ongoing discussions in biology about the validity of the concept " subspecies " . The authors also noted that some widely used textbooks in biology such as Douglas J. Futuyama 's 1986 " Evolutionary Biology " had abandoned the race concept , " The concept of race , masking the overwhelming genetic similarity of all peoples and the mosaic patterns of variation that do not correspond to racial divisions , is not only socially dysfunctional but is biologically indefensible as well ( pp . 5 18-5 19 ) . " ( Lieberman et al . 1992 , pp . 316–17 )
One of Hyderabad 's earliest newspapers , The Deccan Times , was established in the 1780s . In modern times , the major Telugu dailies published in Hyderabad are Eenadu , Andhra Jyothy , Sakshi and Namaste Telangana , while the major English papers are The Times of India , The Hindu and The Deccan Chronicle . The major Urdu papers include The Siasat Daily , The Munsif Daily and Etemaad . Many coffee table magazines , professional magazines and research journals are also regularly published . The Secunderabad Cantonment Board established the first radio station in Hyderabad State around 1919 . Deccan Radio was the first radio public broadcast station in the city starting on 3 February 1935 , with FM broadcasting beginning in 2000 . The available channels in Hyderabad include All India Radio , Radio Mirchi , Radio City , Red FM and Big FM .
According to the Constitution , executive power is exercised by the President of the Republic and the Government . From the Constitutional amendment of 1986 the President 's duties were curtailed to a significant extent , and they are now largely ceremonial ; most political power thus lies in the hands of the Prime Minister . The position of Prime Minister , Greece 's head of government , belongs to the current leader of the political party that can obtain a vote of confidence by the Parliament . The President of the Republic formally appoints the Prime Minister and , on his recommendation , appoints and dismisses the other members of the Cabinet .
A similar struggle began in India when the Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence . Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar Conspiracy ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts . This led to tension , particularly in the Punjab region , where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre . In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the event , between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy , and those who viewed it with revulsion . The subsequent Non-Co-Operation movement was called off in March 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident , and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years .
Many factors played a role in Britain’s long-term economic growth , such as the industrial revolution in the late 1700s and the prominent presence of child labour during the industrial age . Children who worked at an early age were often not forced ; but did so because they needed to help their family survive financially . Due to poor employment opportunities for many parents , sending their children to work on farms and in factories was a way to help feed and support the family . Child Labour first started to occur in England when household businesses were turned into local labour markets that mass-produced the once homemade goods . Because children often helped produce the goods out of their homes , working in a factory to make those same goods was a simple change for many of these youths . Although there are many counts of children under the age of ten working for factories , the majority of children workers were between the ages of ten and fourteen . This age range was an important time for many youths as they were first helping to provide for their families ; while also transitioning to save for their own future families .
One-color light is well suited for traffic lights and signals , exit signs , emergency vehicle lighting , ships ' navigation lights or lanterns ( chromacity and luminance standards being set under the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 , Annex I and the CIE ) and LED-based Christmas lights . In cold climates , LED traffic lights may remain snow-covered . Red or yellow LEDs are used in indicator and alphanumeric displays in environments where night vision must be retained : aircraft cockpits , submarine and ship bridges , astronomy observatories , and in the field , e.g . night time animal watching and military field use .
During the 1930s solid fuel rockets were under development in the Soviet Union and Britain . In Britain the interest was for anti-aircraft fire , it quickly became clear that guidance would be required for precision . However , rockets , or 'unrotated projectiles ' as they were called could the used for anti-aircraft barrages . A 2-inch rocket using HE or wire obstacle warheads was introduced first to deal with low-level or dive bombing attacks on smaller targets such as airfields . The 3-inch was in development at the end of the inter-war period .
Internationally , in 1920 , the RSFSR was recognized as an independent state only by Estonia , Finland , Latvia and Lithuania in the Treaty of Tartu and by the short-lived Irish Republic .
Gymnasts sprint down a runway , which is a maximum of 25 meters in length , before hurdling onto a spring board . The gymnast is allowed to choose where they start on the runway . The body position is maintained while " punching " ( blocking using only a shoulder movement ) the vaulting platform . The gymnast then rotates to a standing position . In advanced gymnastics , multiple twists and somersaults may be added before landing . Successful vaults depend on the speed of the run , the length of the hurdle , the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle , the kinesthetic awareness in the air , and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults .
Also labeled an Orphist by Apollinaire , Marcel Duchamp was responsible for another extreme development inspired by Cubism . The ready-made arose from a joint consideration that the work itself is considered an object ( just as a painting ) , and that it uses the material detritus of the world ( as collage and papier collé in the Cubist construction and Assemblage ) . The next logical step , for Duchamp , was to present an ordinary object as a self-sufficient work of art representing only itself . In 1913 he attached a bicycle wheel to a kitchen stool and in 1914 selected a bottle-drying rack as a sculpture in its own right .
Josip Broz Tito ( Cyrillic : Јосип Броз Тито , pronounced [ jǒsip brôːz tîto ] ; born Josip Broz ; 7 May 1892 [ nb 1 ] – 4 May 1980 ) was a Yugoslav revolutionary and statesman , serving in various roles from 1943 until his death in 1980 . During World War II he was the leader of the Partisans , often regarded as the most effective resistance movement in occupied Europe . While his presidency has been criticized as authoritarian , and concerns about the repression of political opponents have been raised , Tito was " seen by most as a benevolent dictator " due to his economic and diplomatic policies . He was a popular public figure both in Yugoslavia and abroad . Viewed as a unifying symbol , his internal policies maintained the peaceful coexistence of the nations of the Yugoslav federation . He gained further international attention as the chief leader of the Non-Aligned Movement , working with Jawaharlal Nehru of India , Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Sukarno of Indonesia .
Peasant society is much less documented than the nobility . Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology ; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century . Most the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes . Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform ; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns , but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm . These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies , some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy . Land settlement also varied greatly . Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants . Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside . There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems . Unlike in the late Roman period , there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat , and it was possible for a free peasant 's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord .
In 1964 , the biologists Paul Ehrlich and Holm pointed out cases where two or more clines are distributed discordantly—for example , melanin is distributed in a decreasing pattern from the equator north and south ; frequencies for the haplotype for beta-S hemoglobin , on the other hand , radiate out of specific geographical points in Africa . As the anthropologists Leonard Lieberman and Fatimah Linda Jackson observed , " Discordant patterns of heterogeneity falsify any description of a population as if it were genotypically or even phenotypically homogeneous " .
Traditionally , Shell was a heavily decentralised business worldwide ( especially in the downstream ) with companies in over 100 countries , each of which operated with a high degree of independence . The upstream tended to be far more centralised with much of the technical and financial direction coming from the central offices in The Hague . Nevertheless , there were very large " exploration and production " companies in a few major oil and gas production centres such as the United Kingdom ( Shell Expro , a Joint Venture with Exxon ) , Nigeria , Brunei , and Oman .
Very small lamps may have the filament support wires extended through the base of the lamp , and can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board for connections . Some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires . Most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires . In the late 19th century , manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases . General Electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the Mazda trademark in 1909 . This standard was soon adopted across the US , and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945 . Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an Edison screw in candelabra , intermediate , or standard or mogul sizes , or double contact bayonet base . Technical standards for lamp bases include ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes , to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer 's products . Bayonet base lamps are frequently used in automotive lamps to resist loosening due to vibration . A bipin base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps .
During the 20th century , many artists immigrated to Mexico City from different regions of Mexico , such as Leopoldo Méndez , an engraver from Veracruz , who supported the creation of the socialist Taller de la Gráfica Popular ( Popular Graphics Workshop ) , designed to help blue-collar workers find a venue to express their art . Other painters came from abroad , such as Catalan painter Remedios Varo and other Spanish and Jewish exiles . It was in the second half of the 20th century that the artistic movement began to drift apart from the Revolutionary theme . José Luis Cuevas opted for a modernist style in contrast to the muralist movement associated with social politics .
George VI 's reign saw the acceleration of the dissolution of the British Empire . The Statute of Westminster 1931 had already acknowledged the evolution of the Dominions into separate sovereign states . The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states , known as the Commonwealth , gathered pace after the Second World War . During the ministry of Clement Attlee , British India became the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan in 1947 . George relinquished the title of Emperor of India , and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead . In 1950 he ceased to be King of India when it became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations , but he remained King of Pakistan until his death and India recognised his new title of Head of the Commonwealth . Other countries left the Commonwealth , such as Burma in January 1948 , Palestine ( divided between Israel and the Arab states ) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949 .
Armenian cuisine is as ancient as the history of Armenia , a combination of different tastes and aromas . The food often has quite a distinct aroma . Closely related to eastern and Mediterranean cuisine , various spices , vegetables , fish , and fruits combine to present unique dishes . The main characteristics of Armenian cuisine are a reliance on the quality of the ingredients rather than heavily spicing food , the use of herbs , the use of wheat in a variety of forms , of legumes , nuts , and fruit ( as a main ingredient as well as to sour food ) , and the stuffing of a wide variety of leaves .
Christianity was a major unifying factor between Eastern and Western Europe before the Arab conquests , but the conquest of North Africa sundered maritime connections between those areas . Increasingly the Byzantine Church differed in language , practices , and liturgy from the western Church . The eastern church used Greek instead of the western Latin . Theological and political differences emerged , and by the early and middle 8th century issues such as iconoclasm , clerical marriage , and state control of the church had widened to the extent that the cultural and religious differences were greater than the similarities . The formal break came in 1054 , when the papacy and the patriarchy of Constantinople clashed over papal supremacy and excommunicated each other , which led to the division of Christianity into two churches—the western branch became the Roman Catholic Church and the eastern branch the Orthodox Church .
Political boundaries drawn by the British did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions , contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas . The British Empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples . Millions left the British Isles , with the founding settler populations of the United States , Canada , Australia and New Zealand coming mainly from Britain and Ireland . Tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities , and between white settler minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe . Settlers in Ireland from Great Britain have left their mark in the form of divided nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland . Millions of people moved to and from British colonies , with large numbers of Indians emigrating to other parts of the empire , such as Malaysia and Fiji , and Chinese people to Malaysia , Singapore and the Caribbean . The demographics of Britain itself was changed after the Second World War owing to immigration to Britain from its former colonies .
In 1978 , Sewall Wright suggested that human populations that have long inhabited separated parts of the world should , in general , be considered different subspecies by the usual criterion that most individuals of such populations can be allocated correctly by inspection . Wright argued that it does not require a trained anthropologist to classify an array of Englishmen , West Africans , and Chinese with 100 % accuracy by features , skin color , and type of hair despite so much variability within each of these groups that every individual can easily be distinguished from every other . However , it is customary to use the term race rather than subspecies for the major subdivisions of the human species as well as for minor ones .
Code points in the range U+D800–U+DBFF ( 1,024 code points ) are known as high-surrogate code points , and code points in the range U+DC00–U+DFFF ( 1,024 code points ) are known as low-surrogate code points . A high-surrogate code point ( also known as a leading surrogate ) followed by a low-surrogate code point ( also known as a trailing surrogate ) together form a surrogate pair used in UTF-16 to represent 1,048,576 code points outside BMP . High and low surrogate code points are not valid by themselves . Thus the range of code points that are available for use as characters is U+0000–U+D7FF and U+E000–U+10FFFF ( 1,112,064 code points ) . The value of these code points ( i.e. , excluding surrogates ) is sometimes referred to as the character 's scalar value .
As the memory of the " Charge of the Light Brigade " demonstrates , the war became an iconic symbol of logistical , medical and tactical failures and mismanagement . Public opinion in the UK was outraged at the logistical and command failures of the war ; the newspapers demanded drastic reforms , and parliamentary investigations demonstrated the multiple failures of the Army . However , the reform campaign was not well organized , and the traditional aristocratic leadership of the Army pulled itself together , and blocked all serious reforms . No one was punished . The outbreak of the Indian Revolution in 1857 shifted attention to the heroic defense of British interest by the army , and further talk of reform went nowhere . The demand for professionalization was , however , achieved by Florence Nightingale , who gained worldwide attention for pioneering and publicizing modern nursing while treating the wounded . :469–71
In the 20th century , the Paris literary community was dominated by Colette , André Gide , François Mauriac , André Malraux , Albert Camus , and , after World War II , by Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre ; Between the wars it was the home of many important expatriate writers , including Ernest Hemingway , Samuel Beckett , and , in the 1970s , Milan Kundera . The winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature , Patrick Modiano–who lives in Paris– , based most of his literary work on the depiction of the city during World War II and the 1960s-1970s .
Tito 's notable grandchildren include Aleksandra Broz , a prominent theatre director in Croatia ; Svetlana Broz , a cardiologist and writer in Bosnia-Herzegovina ; and Josip " Joška " Broz , Edvard Broz and Natali Klasevski , an artisan of Bosnia-Herzegovina .
Arsenal was the first club from the south of England to join The Football League , in 1893 . They entered the First Division in 1904 , and have since accumulated the second most points . Relegated only once , in 1913 , they continue the longest streak in the top division . In the 1930s , Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups , and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war . In 1970–71 , they won their first League and FA Cup Double . Between 1988 and 2005 , they won five League titles and five FA Cups , including two more Doubles . They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position .
The population of England rose rapidly during the 19th and 20th centuries whereas the populations of Scotland and Wales have shown little increase during the 20th century , with the population of Scotland remaining unchanged since 1951 . Ireland for most of its history comprised a population proportionate to its land area ( about one third of the total population ) . However , since the Great Irish Famine , the population of Ireland has fallen to less than one tenth of the population of the British Isles . The famine , which caused a century-long population decline , drastically reduced the Irish population and permanently altered the demographic make-up of the British Isles . On a global scale , this disaster led to the creation of an Irish diaspora that numbers fifteen times the current population of the island .
One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art ' as a cultural phenomenon . Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting ' , 'sculpture ' , or 'literature ' , conceived as independent artistic activities , do not exist , or exist in a significantly different form , in most non-Western contexts . To surmount this difficulty , anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which , without exclusively being 'artistic ' , have certain evident 'aesthetic ' qualities . Boas ' Primitive Art , Claude Lévi-Strauss ' The Way of the Masks ( 1982 ) or Geertz 's 'Art as Cultural System ' ( 1983 ) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art ' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics ' .
In recent years the city government , under Mayor Manny Diaz , has taken an ambitious stance in support of bicycling in Miami for both recreation and commuting . Every month , the city hosts " Bike Miami " , where major streets in Downtown and Brickell are closed to automobiles , but left open for pedestrians and bicyclists . The event began in November 2008 , and has doubled in popularity from 1,500 participants to about 3,000 in the October 2009 Bike Miami . This is the longest-running such event in the US . In October 2009 , the city also approved an extensive 20-year plan for bike routes and paths around the city . The city has begun construction of bike routes as of late 2009 , and ordinances requiring bike parking in all future construction in the city became mandatory as of October 2009 .
Tucson ( /ˈtuːsɒn/ /tuːˈsɒn/ ) is a city and the county seat of Pima County , Arizona , United States , and home to the University of Arizona . The 2010 United States Census put the population at 520,116 , while the 2013 estimated population of the entire Tucson metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) was 996,544 . The Tucson MSA forms part of the larger Tucson-Nogales combined statistical area ( CSA ) , with a total population of 980,263 as of the 2010 Census . Tucson is the second-largest populated city in Arizona behind Phoenix , both of which anchor the Arizona Sun Corridor . The city is located 108 miles ( 174 km ) southeast of Phoenix and 60 mi ( 97 km ) north of the U.S.-Mexico border . Tucson is the 33rd largest city and the 59th largest metropolitan area in the United States . Roughly 150 Tucson companies are involved in the design and manufacture of optics and optoelectronics systems , earning Tucson the nickname Optics Valley .
Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30 . It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table . In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium : its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2 . Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth 's crust and has five stable isotopes . The most common zinc ore is sphalerite ( zinc blende ) , a zinc sulfide mineral . The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia , Asia , and the United States . Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore , roasting , and final extraction using electricity ( electrowinning ) .
The years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the " Big Four " with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City both breaking into the top four . In the 2009–10 season , Tottenham finished fourth and became the first team to break the top four since Everton in 2005 . Criticism of the gap between an elite group of " super clubs " and the majority of the Premier League has continued , nevertheless , due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs . Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season , becoming the first club outside the " Big Four " to win since 1994–95 . That season also saw two of the Big Four ( Chelsea and Liverpool ) finish outside the top four places for the first time since 1994–95 .
In August 1943 the Allies formed a new South East Asia Command ( SEAC ) to take over strategic responsibilities for Burma and India from the British India Command , under Wavell . In October 1943 Winston Churchill appointed Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten as its Supreme Commander . The British and Indian Fourteenth Army was formed to face the Japanese in Burma . Under Lieutenant General William Slim , its training , morale and health greatly improved . The American General Joseph Stilwell , who also was deputy commander to Mountbatten and commanded U.S. forces in the China Burma India Theater , directed aid to China and prepared to construct the Ledo Road to link India and China by land .
In 1992 , Yitzhak Rabin became Prime Minister following an election in which his party called for compromise with Israel 's neighbors . The following year , Shimon Peres on behalf of Israel , and Mahmoud Abbas for the PLO , signed the Oslo Accords , which gave the Palestinian National Authority the right to govern parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . The PLO also recognized Israel 's right to exist and pledged an end to terrorism . In 1994 , the Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace was signed , making Jordan the second Arab country to normalize relations with Israel . Arab public support for the Accords was damaged by the continuation of Israeli settlements and checkpoints , and the deterioration of economic conditions . Israeli public support for the Accords waned as Israel was struck by Palestinian suicide attacks . Finally , while leaving a peace rally in November 1995 , Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a far-right-wing Jew who opposed the Accords .
Copper has been in use at least 10,000 years , but more than 95 % of all copper ever mined and smelted has been extracted since 1900 , and more than half was extracted in only the last 24 years . As with many natural resources , the total amount of copper on Earth is vast ( around 1014 tons just in the top kilometer of Earth 's crust , or about 5 million years ' worth at the current rate of extraction ) . However , only a tiny fraction of these reserves is economically viable , given present-day prices and technologies . Various estimates of existing copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years , depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate . Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world . Because of these and other factors , the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate , including the concept of peak copper , analogous to peak oil .

Comcast operates multiple cable-only channels ( including E ! Entertainment Television , the Golf Channel , and NBCSN ) , over-the-air national broadcast network channels ( NBC and Telemundo ) , the film production studio Universal Pictures , and Universal Parks & Resorts , with a global total of nearly 200 family entertainment locations and attractions in the U.S. and several other countries including U.A.E. , South Korea , Russia and China , with several new locations reportedly planned and being developed for future operation . Comcast also has significant holding in digital distribution ( thePlatform ) . In February 2014 the company agreed to merge with Time Warner Cable in an equity swap deal worth $ 45.2 billion . Under the terms of the agreement Comcast was to acquire 100 % of Time Warner Cable . However , on April 24 , 2015 , Comcast terminated the agreement .
One of Albert 's greatest contributions was his study of Dionysus the Areopagite , a mystical theologian whose words left an indelible imprint in the medieval period . Magnus ' writings made a significant contribution to German mysticism , which became vibrant in the minds of the Beguines and women such as Hildegard of Bingen and Mechthild of Magdeburg . Mysticism , for the purposes of this study , refers to the conviction that all believers have the capability to experience God 's love . This love may manifest itself through brief ecstatic experiences , such that one may be engulfed by God and gain an immediate knowledge of Him , which is unknowable through the intellect alone .
When war with France broke out again in 1202 , John achieved early victories , but shortages of military resources and his treatment of Norman , Breton and Anjou nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1204 . John spent much of the next decade attempting to regain these lands , raising huge revenues , reforming his armed forces and rebuilding continental alliances . John 's judicial reforms had a lasting impact on the English common law system , as well as providing an additional source of revenue . An argument with Pope Innocent III led to John 's excommunication in 1209 , a dispute finally settled by the king in 1213 . John 's attempt to defeat Philip in 1214 failed due to the French victory over John 's allies at the battle of Bouvines . When he returned to England , John faced a rebellion by many of his barons , who were unhappy with his fiscal policies and his treatment of many of England 's most powerful nobles . Although both John and the barons agreed to the Magna Carta peace treaty in 1215 , neither side complied with its conditions . Civil war broke out shortly afterwards , with the barons aided by Louis of France . It soon descended into a stalemate . John died of dysentery contracted whilst on campaign in eastern England during late 1216 ; supporters of his son Henry III went on to achieve victory over Louis and the rebel barons the following year .
In 215 BC Philip , with his eye on Illyria , formed an alliance with Rome 's enemy Hannibal of Carthage , which led to Roman alliances with the Achaean League , Rhodes and Pergamum . The First Macedonian War broke out in 212 BC , and ended inconclusively in 205 BC . Philip continued to wage war against Pergamon and Rhodes for control of the Aegean ( 204-200 BCE ) and ignored Roman demands for non-intervention in Greece by invading Attica . In 198 BC , during the Second Macedonian War Philip was decisively defeated at Cynoscephalae by the Roman proconsul Titus Quinctius Flamininus and Macedon lost all its territories in Greece proper . Greece was now thoroughly brought into the Roman sphere of influence , though it retained nominal autonomy . The end of Antigonid Macedon came when Philip V 's son , Perseus , was defeated and captured by the Romans in the Third Macedonian War ( 171–168 BCE ) .
When people say that the genome of a sexually reproducing species has been " sequenced " , typically they are referring to a determination of the sequences of one set of autosomes and one of each type of sex chromosome , which together represent both of the possible sexes . Even in species that exist in only one sex , what is described as a " genome sequence " may be a composite read from the chromosomes of various individuals . Colloquially , the phrase " genetic makeup " is sometimes used to signify the genome of a particular individual or organism . [ citation needed ] The study of the global properties of genomes of related organisms is usually referred to as genomics , which distinguishes it from genetics which generally studies the properties of single genes or groups of genes .
Lighting is classified by intended use as general , accent , or task lighting , depending largely on the distribution of the light produced by the fixture .
On January 7 , 2012 , Beyoncé gave birth to a daughter , Blue Ivy Carter , at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York under heavy security . Two days later , Jay Z released " Glory " , a song dedicated to their child , on his website Lifeandtimes.com . The song detailed the couple 's pregnancy struggles , including a miscarriage Beyoncé suffered before becoming pregnant with Blue Ivy . Blue Ivy 's cries are included at the end of the song , and she was officially credited as " B.I.C . " on it . At two days old , she became the youngest person ever to appear on a Billboard chart when " Glory " debuted on the Hot R & B/Hip-Hop Songs chart .
Internationally , the torch and its accompanying party traveled in a chartered Air China Airbus A330 ( registered B-6075 ) , painted in the red and yellow colors of the Olympic Games . Air China was chosen by the Beijing Committees of the Olympic Game as the designated Olympic torch carrier in March 2008 for its long-standing participation in the Olympic cause . The plane traveled a total of 137,000 km ( 85,000 mi ) for a duration of 130 days through 21 countries and regions .
Cotton lisle is a finely-spun , tightly twisted type of cotton that is noted for being strong and durable . Lisle is composed of two strands that have each been twisted an extra twist per inch than ordinary yarns and combined to create a single thread . The yarn is spun so that it is compact and solid . This cotton is used mainly for underwear , stockings , and gloves . Colors applied to this yarn are noted for being more brilliant than colors applied to softer yarn . This type of thread was first made in the city of Lisle , France ( now Lille ) , hence its name .
Both Roger Williams and John Clarke , his compatriot and coworker for religious freedom , are variously credited as founding the earliest Baptist church in North America . In 1639 , Williams established a Baptist church in Providence , Rhode Island , and Clarke began a Baptist church in Newport , Rhode Island . According to a Baptist historian who has researched the matter extensively , " There is much debate over the centuries as to whether the Providence or Newport church deserved the place of 'first ' Baptist congregation in America . Exact records for both congregations are lacking . "
In recent years , Apple has seen a significant boost in sales of Macs . This has been attributed , in part , to the success of the iPod and the iPhone , a halo effect whereby satisfied iPod or iPhone owners purchase more Apple products , and Apple has since capitalized on that with the iCloud cloud service that allows users to seamlessly sync data between these devices and Macs . Nonetheless , like other personal computer manufacturers , the Macintosh lines have been hurt by consumer trend towards smartphones and tablet computers ( particularly Apple 's own iPhone and iPad , respectively ) as the computing devices of choice among consumers .
West of the Historic Center ( Centro Histórico ) along Paseo de la Reforma are many of the city 's wealthiest neighborhoods such as Polanco , Lomas de Chapultepec , Bosques de las Lomas , Santa Fe , and ( in the State of Mexico ) Interlomas , which are also the city 's most important areas of class A office space , corporate headquarters , skyscrapers and shopping malls . Nevertheless , areas of lower income colonias exist in some cases cheek-by-jowl with rich neighborhoods , particularly in the case of Santa Fe .
Ethnic Egyptians are by far the largest ethnic group in the country , constituting 91 % of the total population . Ethnic minorities include the Abazas , Turks , Greeks , Bedouin Arab tribes living in the eastern deserts and the Sinai Peninsula , the Berber-speaking Siwis ( Amazigh ) of the Siwa Oasis , and the Nubian communities clustered along the Nile . There are also tribal Beja communities concentrated in the south-eastern-most corner of the country , and a number of Dom clans mostly in the Nile Delta and Faiyum who are progressively becoming assimilated as urbanisation increases .
Under the supervision of May and Taylor , numerous restoration projects have been under way involving Queen 's lengthy audio and video catalogue . DVD releases of their 1986 Wembley concert ( titled Live at Wembley Stadium ) , 1982 Milton Keynes concert ( Queen on Fire – Live at the Bowl ) , and two Greatest Video Hits ( Volumes 1 and 2 , spanning the 1970s and 1980s ) have seen the band 's music remixed into 5.1 and DTS surround sound . So far , only two of the band 's albums , A Night at the Opera and The Game , have been fully remixed into high-resolution multichannel surround on DVD-Audio . A Night at the Opera was re-released with some revised 5.1 mixes and accompanying videos in 2005 for the 30th anniversary of the album 's original release ( CD+DVD-Video set ) . In 2007 , a Blu-ray edition of Queen 's previously released concerts , Queen Rock Montreal & Live Aid , was released , marking their first project in 1080p HD .
While he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan , Avicenna wrote his famous " Floating Man " – literally falling man – thought experiment to demonstrate human self-awareness and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul . Avicenna believed his " Floating Man " thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance , and claimed humans can not doubt their own consciousness , even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input . The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air , isolated from all sensations , which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies . He argued that , in this scenario , one would still have self-consciousness . Because it is conceivable that a person , suspended in air while cut off from sense experience , would still be capable of determining his own existence , the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection , independent of the body , and an immaterial substance . The conceivability of this " Floating Man " indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually , which entails the soul 's separateness from the body . Avicenna referred to the living human intelligence , particularly the active intellect , which he believed to be the hypostasis by which God communicates truth to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature . Following is an English translation of the argument :
The term Ashkenazi also refers to the nusach Ashkenaz ( Hebrew , " liturgical tradition " , or rite ) used by Ashkenazi Jews in their Siddur ( prayer book ) . A nusach is defined by a liturgical tradition 's choice of prayers , order of prayers , text of prayers and melodies used in the singing of prayers . Two other major forms of nusach among Ashkenazic Jews are Nusach Sefard ( not to be confused with the Sephardic ritual ) , which is the general Polish Hasidic nusach , and Nusach Ari , as used by Lubavitch Hasidim .
Originally much of the valley laid beneath the waters of Lake Texcoco , a system of interconnected salt and freshwater lakes . The Aztecs built dikes to separate the fresh water used to raise crops in chinampas and to prevent recurrent floods . These dikes were destroyed during the siege of Tenochtitlan , and during colonial times the Spanish regularly drained the lake to prevent floods . Only a small section of the original lake remains , located outside the Federal District , in the municipality of Atenco , State of Mexico .
Many beers are sold in cans , though there is considerable variation in the proportion between different countries . In Sweden in 2001 , 63.9 % of beer was sold in cans . People either drink from the can or pour the beer into a glass . A technology developed by Crown Holdings for the 2010 FIFA World Cup is the 'full aperture ' can , so named because the entire lid is removed during the opening process , turning the can into a drinking cup . Cans protect the beer from light ( thereby preventing " skunked " beer ) and have a seal less prone to leaking over time than bottles . Cans were initially viewed as a technological breakthrough for maintaining the quality of a beer , then became commonly associated with less expensive , mass-produced beers , even though the quality of storage in cans is much like bottles . Plastic ( PET ) bottles are used by some breweries .
A political party is typically led by a party leader ( the most powerful member and spokesperson representing the party ) , a party secretary ( who maintains the daily work and records of party meetings ) , party treasurer ( who is responsible for membership dues ) and party chair ( who forms strategies for recruiting and retaining party members , and also chairs party meetings ) . Most of the above positions are also members of the party executive , the leading organization which sets policy for the entire party at the national level . The structure is far more decentralized in the United States because of the separation of powers , federalism and the multiplicity of economic interests and religious sects . Even state parties are decentralized as county and other local committees are largely independent of state central committees . The national party leader in the U.S. will be the president , if the party holds that office , or a prominent member of Congress in opposition ( although a big-state governor may aspire to that role ) . Officially , each party has a chairman for its national committee who is a prominent spokesman , organizer and fund-raiser , but without the status of prominent elected office holders .
Possibly the first venture into fictional treatments of Chopin 's life was a fanciful operatic version of some of its events . Chopin was written by Giacomo Orefice and produced in Milan in 1901 . All the music is derived from that of Chopin .
Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas primarily focus on Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups and Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups . " Y-DNA " is passed solely along the patrilineal line , from father to son , while " mtDNA " is passed down the matrilineal line , from mother to offspring of both sexes . Neither recombines , and thus Y-DNA and mtDNA change only by chance mutation at each generation with no intermixture between parents ' genetic material . Autosomal " atDNA " markers are also used , but differ from mtDNA or Y-DNA in that they overlap significantly . AtDNA is generally used to measure the average continent-of-ancestry genetic admixture in the entire human genome and related isolated populations .
A major international priority for Tuvalu in the UN , at the 2002 Earth Summit in Johannesburg , South Africa and in other international fora , is promoting concern about global warming and the possible sea level rising . Tuvalu advocates ratification and implementation of the Kyoto Protocol . In December 2009 the islands stalled talks on climate change at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen , fearing some other developing countries were not committing fully to binding deals on a reduction in carbon emissions . Their chief negotiator stated , " Tuvalu is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change and our future rests on the outcome of this meeting . "
The Rev . John J. Cavanaugh , C.S.C . served as president from 1946 to 1952 . Cavanaugh 's legacy at Notre Dame in the post-war years was devoted to raising academic standards and reshaping the university administration to suit it to an enlarged educational mission and an expanded student body and stressing advanced studies and research at a time when Notre Dame quadrupled in student census , undergraduate enrollment increased by more than half , and graduate student enrollment grew fivefold . Cavanaugh also established the Lobund Institute for Animal Studies and Notre Dame 's Medieval Institute . Cavanaugh also presided over the construction of the Nieuwland Science Hall , Fisher Hall , and the Morris Inn , as well as the Hall of Liberal Arts ( now O'Shaughnessy Hall ) , made possible by a donation from I.A . O'Shaughnessy , at the time the largest ever made to an American Catholic university . Cavanaugh also established a system of advisory councils at the university , which continue today and are vital to the university 's governance and development
In 2002 , Queen 's " Bohemian Rhapsody " was voted " the UK 's favourite hit of all time " in a poll conducted by the Guinness World Records British Hit Singles Book . In 2004 the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame . Many scholars consider the " Bohemian Rhapsody " music video ground-breaking , and credit it with popularising the medium . Rock historian Paul Fowles states the song is " widely credited as the first global hit single for which an accompanying video was central to the marketing strategy " . It has been hailed as launching the MTV age . Acclaimed for their stadium rock , in 2005 an industry poll ranked Queen 's performance at Live Aid in 1985 as the best live act in history . In 2007 , they were also voted the greatest British band in history by BBC Radio 2 listeners .
In 2006 , Switzerland approved 1 billion francs of supportive investment in the poorer Southern and Central European countries in support of cooperation and positive ties to the EU as a whole . A further referendum will be needed to approve 300 million francs to support Romania and Bulgaria and their recent admission . The Swiss have also been under EU and sometimes international pressure to reduce banking secrecy and to raise tax rates to parity with the EU . Preparatory discussions are being opened in four new areas : opening up the electricity market , participation in the European GNSS project Galileo , cooperating with the European centre for disease prevention and recognising certificates of origin for food products .
The ISO standard ISO 12232:2006 gives digital still camera manufacturers a choice of five different techniques for determining the exposure index rating at each sensitivity setting provided by a particular camera model . Three of the techniques in ISO 12232:2006 are carried over from the 1998 version of the standard , while two new techniques allowing for measurement of JPEG output files are introduced from CIPA DC-004 . Depending on the technique selected , the exposure index rating can depend on the sensor sensitivity , the sensor noise , and the appearance of the resulting image . The standard specifies the measurement of light sensitivity of the entire digital camera system and not of individual components such as digital sensors , although Kodak has reported using a variation to characterize the sensitivity of two of their sensors in 2001 .
As the Ottoman state attempted to modernize its infrastructure and army in response to threats from the outside , it also opened itself up to a different kind of threat : that of creditors . Indeed , as the historian Eugene Rogan has written , " the single greatest threat to the independence of the Middle East " in the nineteenth century " was not the armies of Europe but its banks . " The Ottoman state , which had begun taking on debt with the Crimean War , was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1875 . By 1881 , the Ottoman Empire agreed to have its debt controlled by an institution known as the Ottoman Public Debt Administration , a council of European men with presidency alternating between France and Britain . The body controlled swaths of the Ottoman economy , and used its position to insure that European capital continued to penetrate the empire , often to the detriment of local Ottoman interests .
The Chamorros , Guam 's indigenous people , settled the island approximately 4,000 years ago . Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan was the first European to visit the island on March 6 , 1521 . Guam was colonized in 1668 with settlers , like Diego Luis de San Vitores , a Catholic missionary . Between the 1500s and the 1700s , Guam was an important stopover for the Spanish Manila Galleons . During the Spanish–American War , the United States captured Guam on June 21 , 1898 . Under the Treaty of Paris , Spain ceded Guam to the United States on December 10 , 1898 . Guam is amongst the seventeen Non-Self-Governing Territories of the United Nations .
LaserDisc 's support for multiple audio tracks allowed for vast supplemental materials to be included on-disc and made it the first available format for " Special Edition " releases ; the 1984 Criterion Collection edition of Citizen Kane is generally credited as being the first " Special Edition " release to home video , [ citation needed ] and for setting the standard by which future SE discs were measured . The disc provided interviews , commentary tracks , documentaries , still photographs , and other features for historians and collectors .
As one of the oldest parts of town , Central Tucson is anchored by the Broadway Village shopping center designed by local architect Josias Joesler at the intersection of Broadway Boulevard and Country Club Road . The 4th Avenue Shopping District between downtown and the University and the Lost Barrio just East of downtown , also have many unique and popular stores . Local retail business in Central Tucson is densely concentrated along Fourth Avenue and the Main Gate Square on University Boulevard near the UA campus . The El Con Mall is also located in the eastern part of midtown .
Expansion caused controversy about Yale 's new roles . Noah Porter , moral philosopher , was president from 1871 to 1886 . During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education , Porter resisted the rise of the new research university , claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education . Many of Porter 's contemporaries criticized his administration , and historians since have disparaged his leadership . Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary , uncritically committed to tradition , but a principled and selective conservative . He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new ; rather , he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture . He may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time , but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university .
In Sand Springs , an outdoor amphitheater called " Discoveryland ! " is the official performance headquarters for the musical Oklahoma ! Ridge Bond , native of McAlester , Oklahoma , starred in the Broadway and International touring productions of Oklahoma ! , playing the role of " Curly McClain " in more than 2,600 performances . In 1953 he was featured along with the Oklahoma ! cast on a CBS Omnibus television broadcast . Bond was instrumental in the title song becoming the Oklahoma state song and is also featured on the U.S. postage stamp commemorating the musical 's 50th anniversary . Historically , the state has produced musical styles such as The Tulsa Sound and western swing , which was popularized at Cain 's Ballroom in Tulsa . The building , known as the " Carnegie Hall of Western Swing " , served as the performance headquarters of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys during the 1930s . Stillwater is known as the epicenter of Red Dirt music , the best-known proponent of which is the late Bob Childers .
North Carolina is home to three major league sports franchises : the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League and the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association are based in Charlotte , while the Raleigh-based Carolina Hurricanes play in the National Hockey League . The Panthers and Hurricanes are the only two major professional sports teams that have the same geographical designation while playing in different metropolitan areas . The Hurricanes are the only major professional team from North Carolina to have won a league championship , having captured the Stanley Cup in 2006 . North Carolina is also home to Charlotte Hounds of the Major League Lacrosse .
All Greeks were united , however , in their determination to liberate the Greek-speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire , regardless of the dialect they spoke . Especially in Crete , a prolonged revolt in 1866–1869 had raised nationalist fervour . When war broke out between Russia and the Ottomans in 1877 , Greek popular sentiment rallied to Russia 's side , but Greece was too poor , and too concerned of British intervention , to officially enter the war . Nevertheless , in 1881 , Thessaly and small parts of Epirus were ceded to Greece as part of the Treaty of Berlin , while frustrating Greek hopes of receiving Crete .
Northwestern was founded in 1851 by John Evans , for whom the City of Evanston is named , and eight other lawyers , businessmen and Methodist leaders . Its founding purpose was to serve the Northwest Territory , an area that today includes the states of Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , Wisconsin and parts of Minnesota . Instruction began in 1855 ; women were admitted in 1869 . Today , the main campus is a 240-acre ( 97 ha ) parcel in Evanston , along the shores of Lake Michigan just 12 miles north of downtown Chicago . The university 's law , medical , and professional schools are located on a 25-acre ( 10 ha ) campus in Chicago 's Streeterville neighborhood . In 2008 , the university opened a campus in Education City , Doha , Qatar with programs in journalism and communication .
A resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases formaldehyde , which could cause contact dermatitis for some people ; no disclosure requirements exist , and in 2008 the U.S. Government Accountability Office tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants . In 1999 , a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing , 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm , which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure .
Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse–chorus structure .
The Solar Hijri calendar , also called the Shamsi Hijri calendar , and abbreviated as SH , is the official calendar of Iran and Afghanistan . It begins on the vernal equinox . Each of the twelve months corresponds with a zodiac sign . The first six months have 31 days , the next five have 30 days , and the last month has 29 days in usual years but 30 days in leap years . The year of Prophet Muhammad 's migration to Medina ( 622 CE ) is fixed as the first year of the calendar , and the New Year 's Day always falls on the March equinox .
At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards , Beyoncé received ten nominations , including Album of the Year for I Am ... Sasha Fierce , Record of the Year for " Halo " , and Song of the Year for " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) " , among others . She tied with Lauryn Hill for most Grammy nominations in a single year by a female artist . In 2010 , Beyoncé was featured on Lady Gaga 's single " Telephone " and its music video . The song topped the US Pop Songs chart , becoming the sixth number-one for both Beyoncé and Gaga , tying them with Mariah Carey for most number-ones since the Nielsen Top 40 airplay chart launched in 1992 . " Telephone " received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals .
Carnival is celebrated in New York City in Brooklyn . As in the UK , the timing of Carnival split from the Christian calendar and is celebrated on Labor Day Monday , in September . It is called the Labor Day Carnival , West Indian Day Parade or West Indian Day Carnival , and was founded by immigrants from Trinidad . That country has one of the largest Caribbean Carnivals . In the mid twentieth century , West Indians moved the event from the beginning of Lent to the Labor Day weekend . Carnival is one of the largest parades and street festivals in New York , with over one million attending . The parade , which consists of steel bands , floats , elaborate Carnival costumes and sound trucks , proceeds along Brooklyn 's Eastern Parkway in the Crown Heights neighborhood .
The Charaka Samhita , thought to have been written between 300 and 500 AD , mentions a metal which , when oxidized , produces pushpanjan , thought to be zinc oxide . Zinc mines at Zawar , near Udaipur in India , have been active since the Mauryan period . The smelting of metallic zinc here , however , appears to have begun around the 12th century AD . One estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries . Another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period . The Rasaratna Samuccaya , written in approximately the 13th century AD , mentions two types of zinc-containing ores : one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes .
Under the Köppen climate classification , Philadelphia falls in the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate zone ( Köppen Cfa ) .

Madonna 's Italian-Catholic background and her relationship with her parents are reflected in the album Like a Prayer . It was an evocation of the impact religion had on her career . Her video for the title track contains Catholic symbolism , such as the stigmata . During The Virgin Tour , she wore a rosary and prayed with it in the music video for " La Isla Bonita " . The " Open Your Heart " video sees her boss scolding her in the Italian language . On the Who 's That Girl World Tour , she dedicated the song " Papa Do n't Preach " to Pope John Paul II .
Virtually all faculty members at Washington University engage in academic research , [ citation needed ] offering opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students across the university 's seven schools . Known for its interdisciplinarity and departmental collaboration , many of Washington University 's research centers and institutes are collaborative efforts between many areas on campus . [ citation needed ] More than 60 % of undergraduates are involved in faculty research across all areas ; it is an institutional priority for undergraduates to be allowed to participate in advanced research . According to the Center for Measuring University Performance , it is considered to be one of the top 10 private research universities in the nation . A dedicated Office of Undergraduate Research is located on the Danforth Campus and serves as a resource to post research opportunities , advise students in finding appropriate positions matching their interests , publish undergraduate research journals , and award research grants to make it financially possible to perform research .
On November 17 , 1987 , SCA acquired CBS Records , which hosted such acts as Michael Jackson , for US $ 2 billion . CBS Inc. , now CBS Corporation , retained the rights to the CBS name for music recordings but granted Sony a temporary license to use the CBS name . CBS Corporation founded a new CBS Records in 2006 , which is distributed by Sony through its RED subsidiary .
The CBS Records Group was led very successfully by Clive Davis until his dismissal in 1972 , after it was discovered that Davis has used CBS funds to finance his personal life , including an expensive bar mitzvah party for his son . He was replaced first by former head Goddard Lieberson , then in 1975 by the colourful and controversial lawyer Walter Yetnikoff , who led the company until 1990 .
Early civilisations in Myanmar included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Burma and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Burma . In the 9th century , the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and , following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s , the Burmese language , culture and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country . The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the Mongol invasions and several warring states emerged . In the 16th century , reunified by the Taungoo Dynasty , the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia . The early 19th century Konbaung Dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well . The British conquered Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century and the country became a British colony . Myanmar became an independent nation in 1948 , initially as a democratic nation and then , following a coup d'état in 1962 , a military dictatorship .
In September 1216 John began a fresh , vigorous attack . He marched from the Cotswolds , feigned an offensive to relieve the besieged Windsor Castle , and attacked eastwards around London to Cambridge to separate the rebel-held areas of Lincolnshire and East Anglia . From there he travelled north to relieve the rebel siege at Lincoln and back east to King 's Lynn , probably to order further supplies from the continent . [ nb 17 ] In King 's Lynn , John contracted dysentery , which would ultimately prove fatal . Meanwhile , Alexander II invaded northern England again , taking Carlisle in August and then marching south to give homage to Prince Louis for his English possessions ; John narrowly missed intercepting Alexander along the way . Tensions between Louis and the English barons began to increase , prompting a wave of desertions , including William Marshal 's son William and William Longespée , who both returned to John 's faction .
Copper , silver and gold are in group 11 of the periodic table , and they share certain attributes : they have one s-orbital electron on top of a filled d-electron shell and are characterized by high ductility and electrical conductivity . The filled d-shells in these elements do not contribute much to the interatomic interactions , which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds . Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells , metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak . This explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper . At the macroscopic scale , introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice , such as grain boundaries , hinders flow of the material under applied stress , thereby increasing its hardness . For this reason , copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form , which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms .
Chinese characters represent words of the language using several strategies . A few characters , including some of the most commonly used , were originally pictograms , which depicted the objects denoted , or simple ideograms , in which meaning was expressed iconically . Some other words were expressed by compound ideograms , but the vast majority were written using the rebus principle , in which a character for a similarly sounding word was either simply borrowed or ( more commonly ) extended with a disambiguating semantic marker to form a phono-semantic compound character .
The World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) recognizes that conflicts may exist between the respect for and implementation of current intellectual property systems and other human rights . In 2001 the UN Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights issued a document called " Human rights and intellectual property " that argued that intellectual property tends to be governed by economic goals when it should be viewed primarily as a social product ; in order to serve human well-being , intellectual property systems must respect and conform to human rights laws . According to the Committee , when systems fail to do so they risk infringing upon the human right to food and health , and to cultural participation and scientific benefits . In 2004 the General Assembly of WIPO adopted The Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization which argues that WIPO should " focus more on the needs of developing countries , and to view IP as one of many tools for development—not as an end in itself " .
The channel also broadcasts two movie blocks during the late evening hours each Sunday : " Silent Sunday Nights " , which features silent films from the United States and abroad , usually in the latest restored version and often with new musical scores ; and " TCM Imports " ( which previously ran on Saturdays until the early 2000s [ specify ] ) , a weekly presentation of films originally released in foreign countries . TCM Underground – which debuted in October 2006 – is a Friday late night block which focuses on cult films , the block was originally hosted by rocker/filmmaker Rob Zombie until December 2006 ( though as of 2014 [ update ] , it is the only regular film presentation block on the channel that does not have a host ) .
It is estimated that in the 11th century Ashkenazi Jews composed only three percent of the world 's Jewish population , while at their peak in 1931 they accounted for 92 percent of the world 's Jews . Immediately prior to the Holocaust , the number of Jews in the world stood at approximately 16.7 million . Statistical figures vary for the contemporary demography of Ashkenazi Jews , oscillating between 10 million and 11.2 million . Sergio DellaPergola in a rough calculation of Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews , implies that Ashkenazi make up less than 74 % of Jews worldwide . Other estimates place Ashkenazi Jews as making up about 75 % of Jews worldwide .
The U.S. GAO 's 2010 findings regarding the great difficulty of accurately gauging the economic impact of copyright infringement was reinforced within the same report by the body 's research into three commonly cited estimates that had previously been provided to U.S. agencies . The GAO report explained that the sources – a Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) estimate , a Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) press release and a Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association estimate – " can not be substantiated or traced back to an underlying data source or methodology . "
Opponents of the Endangered Species Act argue that with over 2,000 endangered species listed , and only 28 delisted due to recovery , the success rate of 1 % over nearly three decades proves that there needs to be serious reform in their methods to actually help the endangered animals and plants . Others argue that the ESA may encourage preemptive habitat destruction by landowners who fear losing the use of their land because of the presence of an endangered species ; known colloquially as " Shoot , Shovel and Shut-Up . " One example of such perverse incentives is the case of a forest owner who , in response to ESA listing of the red-cockaded woodpecker , increased harvesting and shortened the age at which he harvests his trees to ensure that they do not become old enough to become suitable habitat . While no studies have shown that the Act 's negative effects , in total , exceed the positive effects , many economists believe that finding a way to reduce such perverse incentives would lead to more effective protection of endangered species .
The first known European explorer to reach Bermuda was Spanish sea captain Juan de Bermúdez in 1503 , after whom the islands are named . He claimed the apparently uninhabited islands for the Spanish Empire . Paying two visits to the archipelago , Bermúdez never landed on the islands , but did create a recognisable map of the archipelago . Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners are now thought to have been responsible for the 1543 inscription in Portuguese Rock ( previously called Spanish Rock ) . Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there , which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began . In 1609 , the English Virginia Company , which had established Jamestown in Virginia ( a term originally applied to all of the North American continent ) two years earlier , permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane , when the crew and passengers of the Sea Venture steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent its sinking , then landed ashore .
Whether there are measurable changes in the sea level relative to the islands of Tuvalu is a contentious issue . There were problems associated with the pre-1993 sea level records from Funafuti which resulted in improvements in the recording technology to provide more reliable data for analysis . The degree of uncertainty as to estimates of sea level change relative to the islands of Tuvalu was reflected in the conclusions made in 2002 from the available data . The 2011 report of the Pacific Climate Change Science Program published by the Australian Government , concludes : " The sea-level rise near Tuvalu measured by satellite altimeters since 1993 is about 5 mm ( 0.2 in ) per year . "
Charleston has one official sister city , Spoleto , Umbria , Italy . The relationship between the two cities began when Pulitzer Prize-winning Italian composer Gian Carlo Menotti selected Charleston as the city to host the American version of Spoleto 's annual Festival of Two Worlds . " Looking for a city that would provide the charm of Spoleto , as well as its wealth of theaters , churches , and other performance spaces , they selected Charleston , South Carolina , as the ideal location . The historic city provided a perfect fit : intimate enough that the Festival would captivate the entire city , yet cosmopolitan enough to provide an enthusiastic audience and robust infrastructure . "
In December 1547 , Francis was in Malacca ( Malaysia ) waiting to return to Goa ( India ) when he met a low-ranked samurai named Anjiro ( possibly spelled " Yajiro " ) . Anjiro was not an intellectual , but he impressed Xavier because he took careful notes of everything he said in church . Xavier made the decision to go to Japan in part because this low-ranking samurai convinced him in Portuguese that the Japanese people were highly educated and eager to learn . They were hard workers and respectful of authority . In their laws and customs they were led by reason , and , should the Christian faith convince them of its truth , they would accept it en masse .
Many people gain a sense of positive self-esteem from their identity groups , which furthers a sense of community and belonging . Another issue that researchers have attempted to address is the question of why people engage in discrimination , i.e. , why they tend to favor those they consider a part of their " in-group " over those considered to be outsiders . Both questions have been given extensive attention by researchers working in the social identity tradition . For example , in work relating to social identity theory it has been shown that merely crafting cognitive distinction between in- and out-groups can lead to subtle effects on people 's evaluations of others ( Cote & Levine 2002 ) .
While Nasser was in Syria , King Saud planned to have him assassinated on his return flight to Cairo . On 4 March , Nasser addressed the masses in Damascus and waved before them the Saudi check given to Syrian security chief and Nasser supporter Abdel Hamid Sarraj to shoot down Nasser 's plane . As a consequence of Saud 's scheme , he was forced by senior members of the Saudi royal family to informally cede most of his powers to his brother , King Faisal , a major opponent of Nasser and advocate for pan-Islamic unity over pan-Arabism .
Video data may be represented as a series of still image frames . The sequence of frames contains spatial and temporal redundancy that video compression algorithms attempt to eliminate or code in a smaller size . Similarities can be encoded by only storing differences between frames , or by using perceptual features of human vision . For example , small differences in color are more difficult to perceive than are changes in brightness . Compression algorithms can average a color across these similar areas to reduce space , in a manner similar to those used in JPEG image compression . Some of these methods are inherently lossy while others may preserve all relevant information from the original , uncompressed video .
Cooler climates can be found in certain parts of Southern European countries , for example within the mountain ranges of Spain and Italy . Additionally , the north coast of Spain experiences a wetter Atlantic climate .
In the Miocene Epoch the mountains underwent severe erosion because of glaciation , which was noted in the mid-19th century by naturalist Louis Agassiz who presented a paper proclaiming the Alps were covered in ice at various intervals—a theory he formed when studying rocks near his Neuchâtel home which he believed originated to the west in the Bernese Oberland . Because of his work he came to be known as the " father of the ice-age concept " although other naturalists before him put forth similar ideas .
The city 's primary commercial airport is the San Diego International Airport ( SAN ) , also known as Lindbergh Field . It is the busiest single-runway airport in the United States . It served over 17 million passengers in 2005 , and is dealing with an increasingly larger number every year . It is located on San Diego Bay three miles ( 4.8 km ) from downtown . San Diego International Airport maintains scheduled flights to the rest of the United States including Hawaii , as well as to Mexico , Canada , Japan , and the United Kingdom . It is operated by an independent agency , the San Diego Regional Airport Authority . In addition , the city itself operates two general-aviation airports , Montgomery Field ( MYF ) and Brown Field ( SDM ) . By 2015 , the Tijuana Cross-border Terminal in Otay Mesa will give direct access to Tijuana International Airport , with passengers walking across the U.S.–Mexico border on a footbridge to catch their flight on the Mexican side .
After several years of economic downturn and political instability , in 1997 , Guinea-Bissau entered the CFA franc monetary system , bringing about some internal monetary stability . The civil war that took place in 1998 and 1999 , and a military coup in September 2003 again disrupted economic activity , leaving a substantial part of the economic and social infrastructure in ruins and intensifying the already widespread poverty . Following the parliamentary elections in March 2004 and presidential elections in July 2005 , the country is trying to recover from the long period of instability , despite a still-fragile political situation .
It is generally considered that the Pacific War began on 7/8 December 1941 , on which date Japan invaded Thailand and attacked the British possessions of Malaya , Singapore , and Hong Kong as well as the United States military bases in Hawaii , Wake Island , Guam and the Philippines . Some historians contend that the conflict in Asia can be dated back to 7 July 1937 with the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War between the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China , or possibly 19 September 1931 , beginning with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria . However , it is more widely accepted that the Pacific War itself started in early December 1941 , with the Sino-Japanese War then becoming part of it as a theater of the greater World War II .

Race and ethnicity are considered separate and distinct identities , with Hispanic or Latino origin asked as a separate question . Thus , in addition to their race or races , all respondents are categorized by membership in one of two ethnic categories , which are " Hispanic or Latino " and " Not Hispanic or Latino " . However , the practice of separating " race " and " ethnicity " as different categories has been criticized both by the American Anthropological Association and members of U.S. Commission on Civil Rights .
In June 1986 , Madonna released her third studio album , True Blue , which was inspired by and dedicated to Sean Penn . Rolling Stone magazine was generally impressed with the effort , writing that the album " sound [ s ] as if it comes from the heart " . It resulted in three singles making it to number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 : " Live to Tell " , " Papa Do n't Preach " and " Open Your Heart " , and two more top-five singles : " True Blue " and " La Isla Bonita " . The album topped the charts in over 28 countries worldwide , an unprecedented achievement at the time , and became her best-selling studio album of her career to this date with sales of 25 million . In the same year , Madonna starred in the critically panned film Shanghai Surprise , for which she was awarded the Golden Raspberry Award for " worst actress " . She made her theatrical debut in a production of David Rabe 's Goose and Tom-Tom ; the film and play both co-starred Penn . The next year , Madonna was featured in the film Who 's That Girl . She contributed four songs to its soundtrack , including the title track and " Causing a Commotion " .
These regions were occupied by " the brown men , " with the yellow in the Far East and the black in Africa . The color issue was not settled until Kenya became independent in 1963 , ending the last vestige of the British Empire .
In March 2001 , 40 multi-national pharmaceutical companies brought litigation against South Africa for its Medicines Act , which allowed the generic production of antiretroviral drugs ( ARVs ) for treating HIV , despite the fact that these drugs were on-patent . HIV was and is an epidemic in South Africa , and ARVs at the time cost between 10,000 and 15,000 USD per patient per year . This was unaffordable for most South African citizens , and so the South African government committed to providing ARVs at prices closer to what people could afford . To do so , they would need to ignore the patents on drugs and produce generics within the country ( using a compulsory license ) , or import them from abroad . After international protest in favour of public health rights ( including the collection of 250,000 signatures by MSF ) , the governments of several developed countries ( including The Netherlands , Germany , France , and later the US ) backed the South African government , and the case was dropped in April of that year .
Developed at roughly the same time as the USB 3.1 specification , but distinct from it , the USB Type-C Specification 1.0 was finalized in August 2014 and defines a new small reversible-plug connector for USB devices . The Type-C plug connects to both hosts and devices , replacing various Type-A and Type-B connectors and cables with a standard meant to be future-proof , similar to Apple Lightning and Thunderbolt . The 24-pin double-sided connector provides four power/ground pairs , two differential pairs for USB 2.0 data bus ( though only one pair is implemented in a Type-C cable ) , four pairs for high-speed data bus , two " sideband use " pins , and two configuration pins for cable orientation detection , dedicated biphase mark code ( BMC ) configuration data channel , and VCONN +5 V power for active cables . Type-A and Type-B adaptors and cables are required for older devices to plug into Type-C hosts . Adapters and cables with a Type-C receptacle are not allowed . [ citation needed ]
Historical records show evidence of Jewish communities north of the Alps and Pyrenees as early as the 8th and 9th century . By the 11th century Jewish settlers , moving from southern European and Middle Eastern centers , appear to have begun to settle in the north , especially along the Rhine , often in response to new economic opportunities and at the invitation of local Christian rulers . Thus Baldwin V , Count of Flanders , invited Jacob ben Yekutiel and his fellow Jews to settle in his lands ; and soon after the Norman Conquest of England , William the Conqueror likewise extended a welcome to continental Jews to take up residence there . Bishop Rüdiger Huzmann called on the Jews of Mainz to relocate to Speyer . In all of these decisions , the idea that Jews had the know-how and capacity to jump-start the economy , improve revenues , and enlarge trade seems to have played a prominent role . Typically Jews relocated close to the markets and churches in town centres , where , though they came under the authority of both royal and ecclesiastical powers , they were accorded administrative autonomy .
Of the city 's population over the age of 25 , 53.8 % ( vs. a national average of 27.4 % ) hold a bachelor 's degree or higher , and 91.9 % ( vs. 84.5 % nationally ) have a high school diploma or equivalent . A 2008 United States Census Bureau survey showed that Seattle had the highest percentage of college and university graduates of any major U.S. city . The city was listed as the most literate of the country 's 69 largest cities in 2005 and 2006 , the second most literate in 2007 and the most literate in 2008 in studies conducted by Central Connecticut State University .
In 179 BC Philip died . His talented and ambitious son , Perseus , took the throne and showed a renewed interest in conquering Greece . With her Greek allies facing a major new threat , Rome declared war on Macedonia again , starting the Third Macedonian War . Perseus initially had some success against the Romans . However , Rome responded by sending a stronger army . This second consular army decisively defeated the Macedonians at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC and the Macedonians duly capitulated , ending the war .
In a speech before the Organization of American States in November 2013 , Kerry remarked that the era of the Monroe Doctrine was over . He went on to explain , " The relationship that we seek and that we have worked hard to foster is not about a United States declaration about how and when it will intervene in the affairs of other American states . It 's about all of our countries viewing one another as equals , sharing responsibilities , cooperating on security issues , and adhering not to doctrine , but to the decisions that we make as partners to advance the values and the interests that we share . "
Thermally , a temperate glacier is at melting point throughout the year , from its surface to its base . The ice of a polar glacier is always below freezing point from the surface to its base , although the surface snowpack may experience seasonal melting . A sub-polar glacier includes both temperate and polar ice , depending on depth beneath the surface and position along the length of the glacier . In a similar way , the thermal regime of a glacier is often described by the temperature at its base alone . A cold-based glacier is below freezing at the ice-ground interface , and is thus frozen to the underlying substrate . A warm-based glacier is above or at freezing at the interface , and is able to slide at this contact . This contrast is thought to a large extent to govern the ability of a glacier to effectively erode its bed , as sliding ice promotes plucking at rock from the surface below . Glaciers which are partly cold-based and partly warm-based are known as polythermal .
Nintendo was not as restrictive as Sega , which did not permit third-party publishing until Mediagenic in late summer 1988 . Nintendo 's intention , however , was to reserve a large part of NES game revenue for itself . Nintendo required that they be the sole manufacturer of all cartridges , and that the publisher had to pay in full before the cartridges for that game be produced . Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo , so publishers assumed all the risk . As a result , some publishers lost more money due to distress sales of remaining inventory at the end of the NES era than they ever earned in profits from sales of the games . Because Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges , it was able to enforce strict rules on its third-party developers , which were required to sign a contract by Nintendo that would obligate these parties to develop exclusively for the system , order at least 10,000 cartridges , and only make five games per year . A 1988 shortage of DRAM and ROM chips also reportedly caused Nintendo to only permit 25 % of publishers ' requests for cartridges . This was an average figure , with some publishers receiving much higher amounts and others almost none . GameSpy noted that Nintendo 's " iron-clad terms " made the company many enemies during the 1980s . Some developers tried to circumvent the five game limit by creating additional company brands like Konami 's Ultra Games label ; others tried circumventing the 10NES chip .
Contributions from governments and the private sector to UNFPA in 2014 exceeded $ 1 billion . The amount includes $ 477 million to the organization’s core resources and $ 529 million earmarked for specific programs and initiatives .
The identification of Jesus as the Messiah is not accepted by Judaism . The term for a Christian in Hebrew is נוּצְרי ( Notzri— " Nazarene " ) , a Talmudic term originally derived from the fact that Jesus came from the Galilean village of Nazareth , today in northern Israel . Adherents of Messianic Judaism are referred to in modern Hebrew as יְהוּדִים מָשִׁיחַיים ( Yehudim Meshihi'im— " Messianic Jews " ) .
Traditional morphology-based or appearance-based systematics have usually given the Hexapoda the rank of superclass , :180 and identified four groups within it : insects ( Ectognatha ) , springtails ( Collembola ) , Protura , and Diplura , the latter three being grouped together as the Entognatha on the basis of internalized mouth parts . Supraordinal relationships have undergone numerous changes with the advent of methods based on evolutionary history and genetic data . A recent theory is that the Hexapoda are polyphyletic ( where the last common ancestor was not a member of the group ) , with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from the Insecta . Many of the traditional appearance-based taxa have been shown to be paraphyletic , so rather than using ranks like subclass , superorder , and infraorder , it has proved better to use monophyletic groupings ( in which the last common ancestor is a member of the group ) . The following represents the best-supported monophyletic groupings for the Insecta .
A wrestler 's championship accomplishments can be central to their career , becoming a measure of their performance ability and drawing power . In general , a wrestler with multiple title reigns or an extended title reign is indicative of a wrestler 's ability to maintain audience interest and/or a wrestler 's ability to perform in the ring . As such , the most accomplished or decorated wrestlers tend to be revered as legends despite the predetermined nature of title reigns . American wrestler Ric Flair has had multiple world heavyweight championship reigns spanning over three decades . Japanese wrestler Último Dragón once held and defended a record 10 titles simultaneously .
In 1976 , Walter Fiers at the University of Ghent ( Belgium ) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a viral RNA-genome ( Bacteriophage MS2 ) . The next year Fred Sanger completed the first DNA-genome sequence : Phage Φ-X174 , of 5386 base pairs . The first complete genome sequences among all three domains of life were released within a short period during the mid-1990s : The first bacterial genome to be sequenced was that of Haemophilus influenzae , completed by a team at The Institute for Genomic Research in 1995 . A few months later , the first eukaryotic genome was completed , with sequences of the 16 chromosomes of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae published as the result of a European-led effort begun in the mid-1980s . The first genome sequence for an archaeon , Methanococcus jannaschii , was completed in 1996 , again by The Institute for Genomic Research .
The main local and regional bus station of Utrecht is located adjacent to Utrecht Centraal railway station , at the East and West entrances . Due to large scale renovation and construction works at the railway station , the station 's bus stops are changing frequently . As a general rule , westbound buses depart from the bus station on the west entrance , other buses from the east side station . Local buses in Utrecht are operated by Qbuzz – its services include a high-frequency service to the Uithof university district . The local bus fleet is one of Europe 's cleanest , using only buses compliant with the Euro-VI standard as well as electric buses for inner city transport . Regional buses from the city are operated by Arriva and Connexxion .
New or " virgin " heavy/heavyweight ( 180–220 g ) vinyl is commonly used for modern audiophile vinyl releases in all genres . Many collectors prefer to have heavyweight vinyl albums , which have been reported to have better sound than normal vinyl because of their higher tolerance against deformation caused by normal play . 180 g vinyl is more expensive to produce only because it uses more vinyl . Manufacturing processes are identical regardless of weight . In fact , pressing lightweight records requires more care . An exception is the propensity of 200 g pressings to be slightly more prone to non-fill , when the vinyl biscuit does not sufficiently fill a deep groove during pressing ( percussion or vocal amplitude changes are the usual locations of these artifacts ) . This flaw causes a grinding or scratching sound at the non-fill point .
Insects ( from Latin insectum , a calque of Greek ἔντομον [ éntomon ] , " cut into sections " ) are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton , a three-part body ( head , thorax and abdomen ) , three pairs of jointed legs , compound eyes and one pair of antennae . They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet , including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms . The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million , and potentially represent over 90 % of the differing animal life forms on Earth . Insects may be found in nearly all environments , although only a small number of species reside in the oceans , a habitat dominated by another arthropod group , crustaceans .
Tajikistan 's economy grew substantially after the war . The GDP of Tajikistan expanded at an average rate of 9.6 % over the period of 2000–2007 according to the World Bank data . This improved Tajikistan 's position among other Central Asian countries ( namely Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan ) , which seem to have degraded economically ever since . The primary sources of income in Tajikistan are aluminium production , cotton growing and remittances from migrant workers . Cotton accounts for 60 % of agricultural output , supporting 75 % of the rural population , and using 45 % of irrigated arable land . The aluminium industry is represented by the state-owned Tajik Aluminum Company – the biggest aluminium plant in Central Asia and one of the biggest in the world .
The Taliban regrouped in western Pakistan and began to unleash an insurgent-style offensive against Coalition forces in late 2002 . Throughout southern and eastern Afghanistan , firefights broke out between the surging Taliban and Coalition forces . Coalition forces responded with a series of military offensives and an increase in the amount of troops in Afghanistan . In February 2010 , Coalition forces launched Operation Moshtarak in southern Afghanistan along with other military offensives in the hopes that they would destroy the Taliban insurgency once and for all . Peace talks are also underway between Taliban affiliated fighters and Coalition forces . In September 2014 , Afghanistan and the United States signed a security agreement , which permits United States and NATO forces to remain in Afghanistan until at least 2024 . The United States and other NATO and non-NATO forces are planning to withdraw ; with the Taliban claiming it has defeated the United States and NATO , and the Obama Administration viewing it as a victory . In December 2014 , ISAF encasing its colors , and Resolute Support began as the NATO operation in Afghanistan . Continued United States operations within Afghanistan will continue under the name " Operation Freedom 's Sentinel " .
In October 2009 , the MoD was heavily criticized for withdrawing the bi-annual non-operational training £20m budget for the volunteer Territorial Army ( TA ) , ending all non-operational training for 6 months until April 2010 . The government eventually backed down and restored the funding . The TA provides a small percentage of the UK 's operational troops . Its members train on weekly evenings and monthly weekends , as well as two-week exercises generally annually and occasionally bi-annually for troops doing other courses . The cuts would have meant a significant loss of personnel and would have had adverse effects on recruitment .
The Prime Minister has the right to appoint a maximum of three such ministers , as the limit of ministers in one government is fifteen . It is also known as the cabinet . The cabinet carries out the country 's domestic and foreign policy , shaped by parliament ; it directs and co-ordinates the work of government institutions and bears full responsibility for everything occurring within the authority of executive power . The government , headed by the Prime Minister , thus represents the political leadership of the country and makes decisions in the name of the whole executive power .
Gymnasts sprint down a runway , which is a maximum of 25 meters in length , before hurdling onto a spring board . The gymnast is allowed to choose where they start on the runway . The body position is maintained while " punching " ( blocking using only a shoulder movement ) the vaulting platform . The gymnast then rotates to a standing position . In advanced gymnastics , multiple twists and somersaults may be added before landing . Successful vaults depend on the speed of the run , the length of the hurdle , the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle , the kinesthetic awareness in the air , and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults .
Philadelphia 's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for America 's revolutionaries . By the 1750s , Philadelphia had surpassed Boston to become the largest city and busiest port in British America , and second in the British Empire , behind London . The city hosted the First Continental Congress before the American Revolutionary War ; the Second Continental Congress , which signed the United States Declaration of Independence , during the war ; and the Constitutional Convention ( 1787 ) after the war . Several battles were fought in and near Philadelphia as well .
The most dense rail network in Europe of 5,063 km ( 3,146 mi ) carries over 350 million passengers annually . In 2007 , each Swiss citizen travelled on average 2,258 km ( 1,403 mi ) by rail , which makes them the keenest rail users . The network is administered mainly by the Federal Railways , except in Graubünden , where the 366 km ( 227 mi ) narrow gauge railway is operated by the Rhaetian Railways and includes some World Heritage lines . The building of new railway base tunnels through the Alps is under way to reduce the time of travel between north and south through the AlpTransit project .
The British Architectural Library , sometimes referred to as the RIBA Library , was established in 1834 upon the founding of the institute with donations from members . Now , with over four million items , it is one of the three largest architectural libraries in the world and the largest in Europe . Some items from the collections are on permanent display at the Victoria and Albert Museum ( V & A ) in the V & A + RIBA Architecture Gallery and included in temporary exhibitions at the RIBA and across Europe and North America . Its collections include :
With nitrides containing aluminium , most often AlGaN and AlGaInN , even shorter wavelengths are achievable . Ultraviolet LEDs in a range of wavelengths are becoming available on the market . Near-UV emitters at wavelengths around 375–395 nm are already cheap and often encountered , for example , as black light lamp replacements for inspection of anti-counterfeiting UV watermarks in some documents and paper currencies . Shorter-wavelength diodes , while substantially more expensive , are commercially available for wavelengths down to 240 nm . As the photosensitivity of microorganisms approximately matches the absorption spectrum of DNA , with a peak at about 260 nm , UV LED emitting at 250–270 nm are to be expected in prospective disinfection and sterilization devices . Recent research has shown that commercially available UVA LEDs ( 365 nm ) are already effective disinfection and sterilization devices . UV-C wavelengths were obtained in laboratories using aluminium nitride ( 210 nm ) , boron nitride ( 215 nm ) and diamond ( 235 nm ) .
The success of the British Commandos during World War II prompted U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to authorize the creation of an intelligence service modeled after the British Secret Intelligence Service ( MI6 ) , and Special Operations Executive . This led to the creation of the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) . On September 20 , 1945 , shortly after the end of World War II , Harry S. Truman signed an executive order dissolving the OSS , and by October 1945 its functions had been divided between the Departments of State and War . The division lasted only a few months . The first public mention of the " Central Intelligence Agency " appeared on a command-restructuring proposal presented by Jim Forrestal and Arthur Radford to the U.S. Senate Military Affairs Committee at the end of 1945 . Despite opposition from the military establishment , the United States Department of State and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , Truman established the National Intelligence Authority in January 1946 , which was the direct predecessor of the CIA . Its operational extension was known as the Central Intelligence Group ( CIG )
In the north , the Republic of Novgorod prospered because it controlled trade routes from the River Volga to the Baltic Sea . As Kievan Rus ' declined , Novgorod became more independent . A local oligarchy ruled Novgorod ; major government decisions were made by a town assembly , which also elected a prince as the city 's military leader . In the 12th century , Novgorod acquired its own archbishop Ilya in 1169 , a sign of increased importance and political independence , while about 30 years prior to that in 1136 in Novgorod was established a republican form of government - elective monarchy . Since then Novgorod enjoyed a wide degree of autonomy although being closely associated with the Kievan Rus .
John von Neumann ( /vɒn ˈnɔɪmən/ ; Hungarian : Neumann János Lajos , pronounced [ ˈnɒjmɒn ˈjaːnoʃ ˈlɒjoʃ ] ; December 28 , 1903 – February 8 , 1957 ) was a Hungarian-American pure and applied mathematician , physicist , inventor , computer scientist , and polymath . He made major contributions to a number of fields , including mathematics ( foundations of mathematics , functional analysis , ergodic theory , geometry , topology , and numerical analysis ) , physics ( quantum mechanics , hydrodynamics , fluid dynamics and quantum statistical mechanics ) , economics ( game theory ) , computing ( Von Neumann architecture , linear programming , self-replicating machines , stochastic computing ) , and statistics .
The city is home or birthplace to a number of contemporary musicians such as R'n'B singer Craig David , Coldplay drummer Will Champion , former Holloways singer Rob Skipper as well as 1980s popstar Howard Jones . Several rock bands were formed in Southampton , including Band of Skulls , The Delays , Bury Tomorrow , Heart in Hand , Thomas Tantrum ( disbanded in 2011 ) and Kids Ca n't Fly ( disbanded in 2014 ) . James Zabiela , a highly regarded and recognised name in dance music , is also from Southampton .
The vast majority of visitors in Greece in 2007 came from the European continent , numbering 12.7 million , while the most visitors from a single nationality were those from the United Kingdom , ( 2.6 million ) , followed closely by those from Germany ( 2.3 million ) . In 2010 , the most visited region of Greece was that of Central Macedonia , with 18 % of the country 's total tourist flow ( amounting to 3.6 million tourists ) , followed by Attica with 2.6 million and the Peloponnese with 1.8 million . Northern Greece is the country 's most-visited geographical region , with 6.5 million tourists , while Central Greece is second with 6.3 million .
On release , Twilight Princess was considered to be the greatest Zelda game ever made by many critics including writers for 1UP.com , Computer and Video Games , Electronic Gaming Monthly , Game Informer , GamesRadar , IGN and The Washington Post . Game Informer called it " so creative that it rivals the best that Hollywood has to offer " . GamesRadar praised Twilight Princess as " a game that deserves nothing but the absolute highest recommendation " . Cubed3 hailed Twilight Princess as " the single greatest videogame experience " . Twilight Princess 's graphics were praised for the art style and animation , although the game was designed for the GameCube , which is technically lacking compared to the next generation consoles . Both IGN and GameSpy pointed out the existence of blurry textures and low-resolution characters . Despite these complaints , Computer and Video Games felt the game 's atmosphere was superior to that of any previous Zelda game , and regarded Twilight Princess 's Hyrule as the best version ever created . PALGN praised the game 's cinematics , noting that " the cutscenes are the best ever in Zelda games " . Regarding the Wii version , GameSpot 's Jeff Gerstmann said the Wii controls felt " tacked-on " , although 1UP.com said the remote-swinging sword attacks were " the most impressive in the entire series " . Gaming Nexus considered Twilight Princess 's soundtrack to be the best of this generation , though IGN criticized its MIDI-formatted songs for lacking " the punch and crispness " of their orchestrated counterparts . Hyper 's Javier Glickman commended the game for its " very long quests , superb Wii controls and being able to save anytime " . However , he criticised it for " no voice acting , no orchestral score and slightly outdated graphics " .
Most early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs , and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0–31 with more graphics . Kaypro CP/M computers used the " upper " 128 characters for the Greek alphabet . The IBM PC defined code page 437 , which replaced the control-characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces , and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions . Operating systems such as DOS supported these code pages , and manufacturers of IBM PCs supported them in hardware . Digital Equipment Corporation developed the Multinational Character Set ( DEC-MCS ) for use in the popular VT220 terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics . The Macintosh defined Mac OS Roman and Postscript also defined a set , both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics , more like modern character sets .
Since the introduction of league football , most club sides play a number of friendlies before the start of each season ( called pre-season friendlies ) . Friendly football matches are considered to be non-competitive and are only used to " warm up " players for a new season/competitive match . There is generally nothing competitive at stake and some rules may be changed or experimented with ( such as unlimited substitutions , which allow teams to play younger , less experienced , players , and no cards ) . Although most friendlies are simply one-off matches arranged by the clubs themselves , in which a certain amount is paid by the challenger club to the incumbent club , some teams do compete in short tournaments , such as the Emirates Cup , Teresa Herrera Trophy and the Amsterdam Tournament . Although these events may involve sponsorship deals and the awarding of a trophy and may even be broadcast on television , there is little prestige attached to them .
For multicellular organisms , typically the embryo is engineered which grows into the adult genetically modified organism . However , the genomes of cells in an adult organism can be edited using gene therapy techniques to treat genetic diseases .
The superstructure of a carrier ( such as the bridge , flight control tower ) are concentrated in a relatively small area called an island , a feature pioneered on the HMS Hermes in 1923 . While the island is usually built on the starboard side of the fight deck , the Japanese aircraft carriers Akagi and Hiryū had their islands built on the port side . Very few carriers have been designed or built without an island . The flush deck configuration proved to have significant drawbacks , primary of which was management of the exhaust from the power plant . Fumes coming across the deck were a major issue in USS Langley . In addition , lack of an island meant difficulties managing the flight deck , performing air traffic control , a lack of radar housing placements and problems with navigating and controlling the ship itself .
Corey Clark was disqualified during the finals for having an undisclosed police record ; however , he later alleged that he and Paula Abdul had an affair while on the show and that this contributed to his expulsion . Clark also claimed that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show due to their affair . The allegations were dismissed by Fox after an independent investigation . Two semi-finalists were also disqualified that year – Jaered Andrews for an arrest on an assault charge , and Frenchie Davis for having previously modelled for an adult website .
On 23 May 2001 , the islands experienced an extratropical cyclone that generated winds up to 190 kilometres per hour ( 120 mph ) . A number of structures were severely damaged and a large number of cattle were killed , prompting emergency aid , provided by the British government .
John 's position in France was considerably strengthened by the victory at Mirebeau , but John 's treatment of his new prisoners and of his ally , William de Roches , quickly undermined these gains . De Roches was a powerful Anjou noble , but John largely ignored him , causing considerable offence , whilst the king kept the rebel leaders in such bad conditions that twenty-two of them died . At this time most of the regional nobility were closely linked through kinship , and this behaviour towards their relatives was regarded as unacceptable . William de Roches and other of John 's regional allies in Anjou and Brittany deserted him in favour of Philip , and Brittany rose in fresh revolt . John 's financial situation was tenuous : once factors such as the comparative military costs of materiel and soldiers were taken into account , Philip enjoyed a considerable , although not overwhelming , advantage of resources over John .

After the Peace of Westphalia , several border territories were assigned to the United Provinces . They were federally-governed Generality Lands ( Generaliteitslanden ) . They were Staats-Brabant ( present North Brabant ) , Staats-Vlaanderen ( present Zeeuws-Vlaanderen ) , Staats-Limburg ( around Maastricht ) and Staats-Oppergelre ( around Venlo , after 1715 ) .
A key component of the arousal system is the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) , a tiny part of the hypothalamus located directly above the point at which the optic nerves from the two eyes cross . The SCN contains the body 's central biological clock . Neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours , circadian rhythms : these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of " clock genes " . The SCN continues to keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution , but it ordinarily receives input from the optic nerves , through the retinohypothalamic tract ( RHT ) , that allows daily light-dark cycles to calibrate the clock .
Charles Pollak ( born Karol Pollak ) , the inventor of the first electrolytic capacitors , found out that the oxide layer on an aluminum anode remained stable in a neutral or alkaline electrolyte , even when the power was switched off . In 1896 he filed a patent for an " Electric liquid capacitor with aluminum electrodes . " Solid electrolyte tantalum capacitors were invented by Bell Laboratories in the early 1950s as a miniaturized and more reliable low-voltage support capacitor to complement their newly invented transistor .
This was a significant step towards restoring communion between Rome and Constantinople . It produced the Catholic-Orthodox Joint declaration of 1965 , which was read out on 7 December 1965 , simultaneously at a public meeting of the Second Vatican Council in Rome and at a special ceremony in Istanbul . The declaration did not end the schism , but showed a desire for greater reconciliation between the two churches . In May 1973 , the Coptic Patriarch Shenouda III of Alexandria visited the Vatican , where he met three times with Pope Paul VI . A common declaration and a joint Creed issued after the visit demonstrated that there are virtually no more [ additional citation needed ] theological discrepancies between the Coptic and Roman Catholic Churches .
Avicenna was a devout Muslim and sought to reconcile rational philosophy with Islamic theology . His aim was to prove the existence of God and His creation of the world scientifically and through reason and logic . Avicenna 's views on Islamic theology ( and philosophy ) were enormously influential , forming part of the core of the curriculum at Islamic religious schools until the 19th century . Avicenna wrote a number of short treatises dealing with Islamic theology . These included treatises on the prophets ( whom he viewed as " inspired philosophers " ) , and also on various scientific and philosophical interpretations of the Quran , such as how Quranic cosmology corresponds to his own philosophical system . In general these treatises linked his philosophical writings to Islamic religious ideas ; for example , the body 's afterlife .
The eligible age-range for contestants is currently fifteen to twenty-eight years old . The initial age limit was sixteen to twenty-four in the first three seasons , but the upper limit was raised to twenty-eight in season four , and the lower limit was reduced to fifteen in season ten . The contestants must be legal U.S. residents , can not have advanced to particular stages of the competition in previous seasons ( varies depending on the season , currently by the semi-final stage until season thirteen ) , and must not hold any current recording or talent representation contract by the semi-final stage ( in previous years by the audition stage ) .
A number of technologies allow asphalt/bitumen to be mixed at much lower temperatures . These involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form " cutbacks " with reduced melting point , or mixtures with water to turn the asphalt/bitumen into an emulsion . Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70 % asphalt/bitumen and typically less than 1.5 % chemical additives . There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates , cationic and anionic . Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications . Chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock , gravel or crushed slag . Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road . Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt , several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements .
The breed with the shortest lifespan ( among breeds for which there is a questionnaire survey with a reasonable sample size ) is the Dogue de Bordeaux , with a median longevity of about 5.2 years , but several breeds , including Miniature Bull Terriers , Bloodhounds , and Irish Wolfhounds are nearly as short-lived , with median longevities of 6 to 7 years .
In an ecosystem , predation is a biological interaction where a predator ( an organism that is hunting ) feeds on its prey ( the organism that is attacked ) . Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them , but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey 's tissue through consumption . Thus predation is often , though not always , carnivory . Other categories of consumption are herbivory ( eating parts of plants ) , fungivory ( eating parts of fungi ) , and detritivory ( the consumption of dead organic material ( detritus ) ) . All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems . It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors . For example , some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died . The key characteristic of predation however is the predator 's direct impact on the prey population . On the other hand , detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the " donor " organism ( s ) .
The bulk of Masonic ritual consists of degree ceremonies . Candidates for Freemasonry are progressively initiated into Freemasonry , first in the degree of Entered Apprentice . Some time later , in a separate ceremony , they will be passed to the degree of Fellowcraft , and finally they will be raised to the degree of Master Mason . In all of these ceremonies , the candidate is entrusted with passwords , signs and grips peculiar to his new rank . Another ceremony is the annual installation of the Master and officers of the Lodge . In some jurisdictions Installed Master is valued as a separate rank , with its own secrets to distinguish its members . In other jurisdictions , the grade is not recognised , and no inner ceremony conveys new secrets during the installation of a new Master of the Lodge .
According to East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism , there is an intermediate state ( Tibetan " bardo " ) between one life and the next . The orthodox Theravada position rejects this ; however there are passages in the Samyutta Nikaya of the Pali Canon that seem to lend support to the idea that the Buddha taught of an intermediate stage between one life and the next .

Utrecht is the centre of a densely populated area , which makes concise definitions of its agglomeration difficult , and somewhat arbitrary . The smaller Utrecht agglomeration of continuously built up areas counts some 420,000 inhabitants and includes Nieuwegein , IJsselstein and Maarssen . It is sometimes argued that the close by municipalities De Bilt , Zeist , Houten , Vianen , Driebergen-Rijsenburg ( Utrechtse Heuvelrug ) , and Bunnik should also be counted towards the Utrecht agglomeration , bringing the total to 640,000 inhabitants . The larger region , including slightly more remote towns such as Woerden and Amersfoort counts up to 820,000 inhabitants .
In 1992 , the university drafted a new Statement on Academic Freedom , specifying that limitations may be placed upon " expression with students or in public that : ( 1 ) contradicts or opposes , rather than analyzes or discusses , fundamental Church doctrine or policy ; ( 2 ) deliberately attacks or derides the Church or its general leaders ; or ( 3 ) violates the Honor Code because the expression is dishonest , illegal , unchaste , profane , or unduly disrespectful of others . " These restrictions have caused some controversy as several professors have been disciplined according to the new rule . The American Association of University Professors has claimed that " infringements on academic freedom are distressingly common and that the climate for academic freedom is distressingly poor . " The new rules have not affected BYU 's accreditation , as the university 's chosen accrediting body allows " religious colleges and universities to place limitations on academic freedom so long as they publish those limitations candidly " , according to associate academic vice president Jim Gordon . The AAUP 's concern was not with restrictions on the faculty member 's religious expression but with a failure , as alleged by the faculty member and AAUP , that the restrictions had not been adequately specified in advance by BYU : " The AAUP requires that any doctrinal limitations on academic freedom be laid out clearly in writing . We [ AAUP ] concluded that BYU had failed to do so adequately . "
High neoclassicism was an international movement . Though neoclassical architecture employed the same classical vocabulary as Late Baroque architecture , it tended to emphasize its planar qualities , rather than sculptural volumes . Projections and recessions and their effects of light and shade were more flat ; sculptural bas-reliefs were flatter and tended to be enframed in friezes , tablets or panels . Its clearly articulated individual features were isolated rather than interpenetrating , autonomous and complete in themselves .
Letter case is often prescribed by the grammar of a language or by the conventions of a particular discipline . In orthography , the uppercase is primarily reserved for special purposes , such as the first letter of a sentence or of a proper noun , which makes the lowercase the more common variant in text . In mathematics , letter case may indicate the relationship between objects with uppercase letters often representing " superior " objects ( e.g . X could be a set containing the generic member x ) . Engineering design drawings are typically labelled entirely in upper-case letters , which are easier to distinguish than lowercase , especially when space restrictions require that the lettering be small .
Carnival Tuesday hosts the main events . Full costume is worn , complete with make-up and body paint/adornment . Usually " Mas Boots " that complement the costumes are worn . Each band has their costume presentation based on a particular theme , and contains various sections ( some consisting of thousands of revelers ) that reflect these themes . The street parade and band costume competition take place . The mas bands eventually converge on the Queen 's Park Savannah to pass on " The Stage " for judging . The singer of the most played song is crowned Road March King or Queen earning prize money and usually a vehicle .
President Franklin Roosevelt ordered General Douglas MacArthur in the Philippines to formulate a Pacific defence plan with Australia in March 1942 . Curtin agreed to place Australian forces under the command of MacArthur who became Supreme Commander , South West Pacific . MacArthur moved his headquarters to Melbourne in March 1942 and American troops began massing in Australia . Enemy naval activity reached Sydney in late May 1942 , when Japanese midget submarines launched a daring raid on Sydney Harbour . On 8 June 1942 , two Japanese submarines briefly shelled Sydney 's eastern suburbs and the city of Newcastle .
The American Lunar Module was finally ready for a successful piloted test flight in low Earth orbit on Apollo 9 in March 1969 . The next mission , Apollo 10 , conducted a " dress rehearsal " for the first landing in May 1969 , flying the LM in lunar orbit as close as 47,400 feet ( 14.4 km ) above the surface , the point where the powered descent to the surface would begin . With the LM proven to work well , the next step was to attempt the actual landing .
On December 2009 , Oklahoma City voters passed MAPS 3 , the $ 777 million ( 7-year 1-cent tax ) initiative , which will include funding ( appx $ 130M ) for an estimated 5-to-6-mile ( 8.0 to 9.7 km ) modern streetcar in downtown Oklahoma City and the establishment of a transit hub . It is believed the streetcar would begin construction in 2014 and be in operation around 2017 .
In the Roman Church , universal positive ecclesiastical laws , based upon either immutable divine and natural law , or changeable circumstantial and merely positive law , derive formal authority and promulgation from the office of pope , who as Supreme Pontiff possesses the totality of legislative , executive , and judicial power in his person . The actual subject material of the canons is not just doctrinal or moral in nature , but all-encompassing of the human condition .
In the late renaissance various writers began to question the medieval and classical understanding of knowledge acquisition in a more fundamental way . In political and historical writing Niccolò Machiavelli and his friend Francesco Guicciardini initiated a new realistic style of writing . Machiavelli in particular was scornful of writers on politics who judged everything in comparison to mental ideals and demanded that people should study the " effectual truth " instead . Their contemporary , Leonardo da Vinci ( 1452–1519 ) said , " If you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down , then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings . "
Philadelphia 's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for America 's revolutionaries . By the 1750s , Philadelphia had surpassed Boston to become the largest city and busiest port in British America , and second in the British Empire , behind London . The city hosted the First Continental Congress before the American Revolutionary War ; the Second Continental Congress , which signed the United States Declaration of Independence , during the war ; and the Constitutional Convention ( 1787 ) after the war . Several battles were fought in and near Philadelphia as well .
Hunting and gathering was humanity 's first and most successful adaptation , occupying at least 90 percent of human history . Following the invention of agriculture , hunter-gatherers have been displaced or conquered by farming or pastoralist groups in most parts of the world .
According to a 2007 BSA and International Data Corporation ( IDC ) study , the five countries with the highest rates of software piracy were : 1 . Armenia ( 93 % ) ; 2 . Bangladesh ( 92 % ) ; 3 . Azerbaijan ( 92 % ) ; 4 . Moldova ( 92 % ) ; and 5 . Zimbabwe ( 91 % ) . According to the study 's results , the five countries with the lowest piracy rates were : 1 . U.S. ( 20 % ) ; 2 . Luxembourg ( 21 % ) ; 3 . New Zealand ( 22 % ) ; 4 . Japan ( 23 % ) ; and 5 . Austria ( 25 % ) . The 2007 report showed that the Asia-Pacific region was associated with the highest amount of loss , in terms of U.S. dollars , with $ 14,090,000 , followed by the European Union , with a loss of $ 12,383,000 ; the lowest amount of U.S. dollars was lost in the Middle East/Africa region , where $ 2,446,000 was documented .
Also with respect to copyright , the American film industry helped to change the social construct of intellectual property via its trade organization , the Motion Picture Association of America . In amicus briefs in important cases , in lobbying before Congress , and in its statements to the public , the MPAA has advocated strong protection of intellectual-property rights . In framing its presentations , the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor . Additionally Congress 's awareness of the position of the United States as the world 's largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property . These doctrinal reforms have further strengthened the industry , lending the MPAA even more power and authority .
The final has never been contested by two teams from outside the top division and there have only been eight winners who were n't in the top flight : Notts County ( 1894 ) ; Tottenham Hotspur ( 1901 ) ; Wolverhampton Wanderers ( 1908 ) ; Barnsley ( 1912 ) ; West Bromwich Albion ( 1931 ) ; Sunderland ( 1973 ) , Southampton ( 1976 ) and West Ham United ( 1980 ) . With the exception of Tottenham , these clubs were all playing in the second tier ( the old Second Division ) - Tottenham were playing in the Southern League and were only elected to the Football League in 1908 , meaning they are the only non-league winners of the FA Cup . Other than Tottenham 's victory , only 24 finalists have come from outside English football 's top tier , with a record of 7 wins and 17 runners-up : and none at all from the third tier or lower , Southampton ( 1902 ) being the last finalist from outside the top two tiers .
Aburish asserts that Nasser was not distressed by his frequent relocations , which broadened his horizons and showed him Egyptian society 's class divisions . His own social status was well below the wealthy Egyptian elite , and his discontent with those born into wealth and power grew throughout his lifetime . Nasser spent most of his spare time reading , particularly in 1933 when he lived near the National Library of Egypt . He read the Qur'an , the sayings of Muhammad , the lives of the Sahaba ( Muhammad 's companions ) , and the biographies of nationalist leaders Napoleon , Ataturk , Otto von Bismarck , and Garibaldi and the autobiography of Winston Churchill .
Schwarzenegger met his next paramour , Sue Moray , a Beverly Hills hairdresser 's assistant , on Venice Beach in July 1977 . According to Moray , the couple led an open relationship : " We were faithful when we were both in LA … but when he was out of town , we were free to do whatever we wanted . " Schwarzenegger met Maria Shriver at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977 , and went on to have a relationship with both women until August 1978 , when Moray ( who knew of his relationship with Shriver ) issued an ultimatum .
After DNA replication is complete , the cell must physically separate the two copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells . :18.2 In prokaryotes ( bacteria and archaea ) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission , in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions . Binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes . Eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle ; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as S phase , whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during M phase . :18.1
Adventurer and poet Luís de Camões ( c. 1524–1580 ) wrote the epic poem " Os Lusíadas " ( The Lusiads ) , with Virgil 's Aeneid as his main influence . Modern Portuguese poetry is rooted in neoclassic and contemporary styles , as exemplified by Fernando Pessoa ( 1888–1935 ) . Modern Portuguese literature is represented by authors such as Almeida Garrett , Camilo Castelo Branco , Eça de Queiroz , Fernando Pessoa , Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen , António Lobo Antunes and Miguel Torga . Particularly popular and distinguished is José Saramago , recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Literature .
After several weeks of rumors , which started around January 11 , 2013 , Dell announced on February 5 , 2013 that it had struck a $ 24.4 billion leveraged buyout deal , that would have delisted its shares from the NASDAQ and Hong Kong Stock Exchange and taken it private . Reuters reported that Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners , aided by a $ 2 billion loan from Microsoft , would acquire the public shares at $ 13.65 apiece . The $ 24.4 billion buyout was projected to be the largest leveraged buyout backed by private equity since the 2007 financial crisis . It is also the largest technology buyout ever , surpassing the 2006 buyout of Freescale Semiconductor for $ 17.5 billion .
The Chicago Transit Authority 's elevated train running through Evanston is called the Purple Line , taking its name from Northwestern 's school color . The Foster and Davis stations are within walking distance of the southern end of the campus , while the Noyes station is close to the northern end of the campus . The Central station is close to Ryan Field , Northwestern 's football stadium . The Evanston Davis Street Metra station serves the Northwestern campus in downtown Evanston and the Evanston Central Street Metra station is near Ryan Field . Pace Suburban Bus Service and the CTA have several bus routes that run through or near the Evanston campus .
The earliest examples of neoclassical architecture in Hungary may be found in Vác . In this town the triumphal arch and the neoclassical façade of the baroque Cathedral were designed by the French architect Isidor Marcellus Amandus Ganneval ( Isidore Canevale ) in the 1760s . Also the work of a French architect Charles Moreau is the garden façade of the Esterházy Palace ( 1797–1805 ) in Kismarton ( today Eisenstadt in Austria ) . The two principal architect of Neoclassicism in Hungary was Mihály Pollack and József Hild . Pollack 's major work is the Hungarian National Museum ( 1837–1844 ) . Hild is famous for his designs for the Cathedral of Eger and Esztergom .
Sanskrit linguist Madhav Deshpande says that when the term " Sanskrit " arose it was not thought of as a specific language set apart from other languages , but rather as a particularly refined or perfected manner of speaking . Knowledge of Sanskrit was a marker of social class and educational attainment in ancient India , and the language was taught mainly to members of the higher castes through the close analysis of Vyākaraṇins such as Pāṇini and Patanjali , who exhorted proper Sanskrit at all times , especially during ritual . Sanskrit , as the learned language of Ancient India , thus existed alongside the vernacular Prakrits , which were Middle Indo-Aryan languages . However , linguistic change led to an eventual loss of mutual intelligibility .
New York City has a high degree of income disparity as indicated by its Gini Coefficient of 0.5 for the city overall and 0.6 for Manhattan . The disparity is driven by wage growth in high-income brackets , while wages have stagnated for middle and lower-income brackets . In the first quarter of 2014 , the average weekly wage in New York County ( Manhattan ) was $ 2,749 , representing the highest total among large counties in the United States . In 2013 , New York City had the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world , higher than the next five U.S. cities combined , including former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg . New York also had the highest density of millionaires per capita among major U.S. cities in 2014 , at 4.6 % of residents . Lower Manhattan has been experiencing a baby boom , with the area south of Canal Street witnessing 1,086 births in 2010 , 12 % greater than 2009 and over twice the number born in 2001 .
In 1348 and 1349 Portugal , like the rest of Europe , was devastated by the Black Death . In 1373 , Portugal made an alliance with England , which is the longest-standing alliance in the world . This alliance served both nations ' interests throughout history and is regarded by many as the predecessor to NATO . Over time this went way beyond geo-political and military cooperation ( protecting both nations ' interests in Africa , the Americas and Asia against French , Spanish and Dutch rivals ) and maintained strong trade and cultural ties between the two old European allies . Particularly in the Oporto region , there is visible English influence to this day .
The painters of the early Renaissance used two traditional lake pigments , made from mixing dye with either chalk or alum , kermes lake , made from kermes insects , and madder lake , made from the rubia tinctorum plant . With the arrival of cochineal , they had a third , carmine , which made a very fine crimson , though it had a tendency to change color if not used carefully . It was used by almost all the great painters of the 15th and 16th centuries , including Rembrandt , Vermeer , Rubens , Anthony van Dyck , Diego Velázquez and Tintoretto . Later it was used by Thomas Gainsborough , Seurat and J.M.W . Turner .
The extensive campaigning abroad by Roman generals , and the rewarding of soldiers with plunder on these campaigns , led to a general trend of soldiers becoming increasingly loyal to their generals rather than to the state . Rome was also plagued by several slave uprisings during this period , in part because vast tracts of land had been given over to slave farming in which the slaves greatly outnumbered their Roman masters . In the 1st century BC at least twelve civil wars and rebellions occurred . This pattern continued until 27 BC , when Octavian ( later Augustus ) successfully challenged the Senate 's authority , and was made princeps ( first citizen ) .
The classification of speech varieties as dialects or languages and their relationship to other varieties of speech can be controversial and the verdicts inconsistent . English and Serbo-Croatian illustrate the point . English and Serbo-Croatian each have two major variants ( British and American English , and Serbian and Croatian , respectively ) , along with numerous other varieties . For political reasons , analyzing these varieties as " languages " or " dialects " yields inconsistent results : British and American English , spoken by close political and military allies , are almost universally regarded as dialects of a single language , whereas the standard languages of Serbia and Croatia , which differ from each other to a similar extent as the dialects of English , are being treated by some linguists from the region as distinct languages , largely because the two countries oscillate from being brotherly to being bitter enemies . ( The Serbo-Croatian language article deals with this topic much more fully . )
The climatic changes of the late Jurassic and Cretaceous provided for further adaptive radiation . The Jurassic was the height of archosaur diversity , and the first birds and eutherian mammals also appeared . Angiosperms radiated sometime in the early Cretaceous , first in the tropics , but the even temperature gradient allowed them to spread toward the poles throughout the period . By the end of the Cretaceous , angiosperms dominated tree floras in many areas , although some evidence suggests that biomass was still dominated by cycad and ferns until after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction .
PlayStation Portable can connect with PlayStation 3 in many ways , including in-game connectivity . For example , Formula One Championship Edition , a racing game , was shown at E3 2006 using a PSP as a real-time rear-view mirror . In addition , users are able to download original PlayStation format games from the PlayStation Store , transfer and play them on PSP as well as PS3 itself . It is also possible to use the Remote Play feature to play these and some PlayStation Network games , remotely on PSP over a network or internet connection .
The standard specifies how speed ratings should be reported by the camera . If the noise-based speed ( 40:1 ) is higher than the saturation-based speed , the noise-based speed should be reported , rounded downwards to a standard value ( e.g . 200 , 250 , 320 , or 400 ) . The rationale is that exposure according to the lower saturation-based speed would not result in a visibly better image . In addition , an exposure latitude can be specified , ranging from the saturation-based speed to the 10:1 noise-based speed . If the noise-based speed ( 40:1 ) is lower than the saturation-based speed , or undefined because of high noise , the saturation-based speed is specified , rounded upwards to a standard value , because using the noise-based speed would lead to overexposed images . The camera may also report the SOS-based speed ( explicitly as being an SOS speed ) , rounded to the nearest standard speed rating .
Losing the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895 was a watershed . Japan , a country long regarded by the Chinese as little more than an upstart nation of pirates , annihilated the Qing government 's modernized Beiyang Fleet , then deemed to be the strongest naval force in Asia . The Japanese victory occurred a mere three decades after the Meiji Restoration set a feudal Japan on course to emulate the Western nations in their economic and technological achievements . Finally , in December 1894 , the Qing government took concrete steps to reform military institutions and to re-train selected units in westernized drills , tactics and weaponry . These units were collectively called the New Army . The most successful of these was the Beiyang Army under the overall supervision and control of a former Huai Army commander , General Yuan Shikai , who used his position to build networks of loyal officers and eventually become President of the Republic of China .
Though queen , as an unmarried young woman Victoria was required by social convention to live with her mother , despite their differences over the Kensington System and her mother 's continued reliance on Conroy . Her mother was consigned to a remote apartment in Buckingham Palace , and Victoria often refused to see her . When Victoria complained to Melbourne that her mother 's close proximity promised " torment for many years " , Melbourne sympathised but said it could be avoided by marriage , which Victoria called a " schocking [ sic ] alternative " . She showed interest in Albert 's education for the future role he would have to play as her husband , but she resisted attempts to rush her into wedlock .
The origins of the HDI are found in the annual Development Reports of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) . These were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq in 1990 and had the explicit purpose " to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies " . To produce the Human Development Reports , Mahbub ul Haq formed a group of development economists including Paul Streeten , Frances Stewart , Gustav Ranis , Keith Griffin , Sudhir Anand , and Meghnad Desai . Working alongside Nobel laureate Amartya Sen , they worked on capabilities and functions that provided the underlying conceptual framework . Haq was sure that a simple composite measure of human development was needed in order to convince the public , academics , and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being . Sen initially opposed this idea , but he soon went on to help Haq develop the Index . Sen was worried that it was going to be difficult to capture the full complexity of human capabilities in a single index , but Haq persuaded him that only a single number would shift the immediate attention of politicians from economic to human well-being .
After fans noticed Mercury 's increasingly gaunt appearance in 1988 , rumours began to spread that Mercury was suffering from AIDS . Mercury flatly denied this , insisting he was merely " exhausted " and too busy to provide interviews . The band decided to continue making albums , starting with The Miracle in 1989 and continuing with Innuendo in 1991 . Despite his deteriorating health , the lead singer continued to contribute . For the last two albums made while Mercury was still alive , the band credited all songs to Queen , rather than specific members of the group , freeing them of internal conflict and differences . In 1990 , Queen ended their contract with Capitol and signed with Disney 's Hollywood Records , which has since remained the group 's music catalogue owner in the United States and Canada . That same year , Mercury made his final public appearance when he joined the rest of Queen to collect the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music .
Freemasonry , as it exists in various forms all over the world , has a membership estimated by the United Grand Lodge of England at around six million worldwide . The fraternity is administratively organised into independent Grand Lodges ( or sometimes Grand Orients ) , each of which governs its own Masonic jurisdiction , which consists of subordinate ( or constituent ) Lodges . The largest single jurisdiction , in terms of membership , is the United Grand Lodge of England ( with a membership estimated at around a quarter million ) . The Grand Lodge of Scotland and Grand Lodge of Ireland ( taken together ) have approximately 150,000 members . In the United States total membership is just under two million .
There is no clear consensus on the nature or even the existence of God . The Abrahamic conceptions of God include the monotheistic definition of God in Judaism , the trinitarian view of Christians , and the Islamic concept of God . The dharmic religions differ in their view of the divine : views of God in Hinduism vary by region , sect , and caste , ranging from monotheistic to polytheistic to atheistic . Divinity was recognized by the historical Buddha , particularly Śakra and Brahma . However , other sentient beings , including gods , can at best only play a supportive role in one 's personal path to salvation . Conceptions of God in the latter developments of the Mahayana tradition give a more prominent place to notions of the divine . [ citation needed ]
The most serious objection to regarding the Demoiselles as the origin of Cubism , with its evident influence of primitive art , is that " such deductions are unhistorical " , wrote the art historian Daniel Robbins . This familiar explanation " fails to give adequate consideration to the complexities of a flourishing art that existed just before and during the period when Picasso 's new painting developed . " Between 1905 and 1908 , a conscious search for a new style caused rapid changes in art across France , Germany , Holland , Italy , and Russia . The Impressionists had used a double point of view , and both Les Nabis and the Symbolists ( who also admired Cézanne ) flattened the picture plane , reducing their subjects to simple geometric forms . Neo-Impressionist structure and subject matter , most notably to be seen in the works of Georges Seurat ( e.g. , Parade de Cirque , Le Chahut and Le Cirque ) , was another important influence . There were also parallels in the development of literature and social thought .
A major consideration was the possible Soviet reaction in the event that the US intervened . The Truman administration was fretful that a war in Korea was a diversionary assault that would escalate to a general war in Europe once the United States committed in Korea . At the same time , " [ t ] here was no suggestion from anyone that the United Nations or the United States could back away from [ the conflict ] " . Yugoslavia–a possible Soviet target because of the Tito-Stalin Split—was vital to the defense of Italy and Greece , and the country was first on the list of the National Security Council 's post-North Korea invasion list of " chief danger spots " . Truman believed if aggression went unchecked a chain reaction would be initiated that would marginalize the United Nations and encourage Communist aggression elsewhere . The UN Security Council approved the use of force to help the South Koreans and the US immediately began using what air and naval forces that were in the area to that end . The Administration still refrained from committing on the ground because some advisers believed the North Koreans could be stopped by air and naval power alone .
In 2015 , fragments of a very early Quran , dating back to 1370 years ago , were discovered in the library of the University of Birmingham , England . According to the tests carried out by Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit , " with a probability of more than 95 % , the parchment was from between 568 and 645 " . The manuscript is written in Hijazi script , an early form of written Arabic . This is possibly the earliest extant exemplar of the Quran , but as the tests allow a range of possible dates , it can not be said with certainty which of the existing versions is the oldest . Saudi scholar Saud al-Sarhan has expressed doubt over the age of the fragments as they contain dots and chapter separators that are believed to have originated later .
A significant modification of Cubism between 1914 and 1916 was signaled by a shift towards a strong emphasis on large overlapping geometric planes and flat surface activity . This grouping of styles of painting and sculpture , especially significant between 1917 and 1920 , was practiced by several artists ; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector Léonce Rosenberg . The tightening of the compositions , the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works , led to its being referred to by the critic Maurice Raynal ( fr ) as 'crystal ' Cubism . Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of World War I—such as the fourth dimension , dynamism of modern life , the occult , and Henri Bergson 's concept of duration—had now been vacated , replaced by a purely formal frame of reference .
As far back as the seventh century Japanese warriors wore a form of lamellar armor , this armor eventually evolved into the armor worn by the samurai . The first types of Japanese armors identified as samurai armor were known as yoroi . These early samurai armors were made from small individual scales known as kozane . The kozane were made from either iron or leather and were bound together into small strips , the strips were coated with lacquer to protect the kozane from water . A series of strips of kozane were then laced together with silk or leather lace and formed into a complete chest armor ( dou or dō ) .
One of the paper 's best known front pages , published on 4 May 1982 , commemorated the torpedoing of the Argentine ship the General Belgrano by running the story under the headline " GOTCHA " . At MacKenzie 's insistence , and against the wishes of Murdoch ( the mogul was present because almost all the journalists were on strike ) , the headline was changed for later editions after the extent of Argentinian casualties became known . John Shirley , a reporter for The Sunday Times , witnessed copies of this edition of The Sun being thrown overboard by sailors and marines on HMS Fearless .
Egypt was producing 691,000 bbl/d of oil and 2,141.05 Tcf of natural gas ( in 2013 ) , which makes Egypt as the largest oil producer not member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and the second-largest dry natural gas producer in Africa . In 2013 , Egypt was the largest consumer of oil and natural gas in Africa , as more than 20 % of total oil consumption and more than 40 % of total dry natural gas consumption in Africa . Also , Egypt possesses the largest oil refinery capacity in Africa 726,000 bbl/d ( in 2012 ) . Egypt is currently planning to build its first nuclear power plant in El Dabaa city , northern Egypt .
By 1937 , Japan controlled Manchuria and was ready to move deeper into China . The Marco Polo Bridge Incident on 7 July 1937 provoked full-scale war between China and Japan . The Nationalist and Communist Chinese suspended their civil war to form a nominal alliance against Japan , and the Soviet Union quickly lent support by providing large amount of materiel to Chinese troops . In August 1937 , Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to fight about 300,000 Japanese troops in Shanghai , but , after three months of fighting , Shanghai fell . The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back , capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937 and committed which was known as Nanking Massacre . In March 1938 , Nationalist forces won their first victory at Taierzhuang . but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by Japanese in May . In June 1938 , Japan deployed about 350,000 troops to invade Wuhan and captured it in October . The Japanese achieved major military victories , but world opinion—in particular in the United States—condemned Japan , especially after the Panay Incident .
Reporters in Chengdu said they saw cracks on walls of some residential buildings in the downtown areas , but no buildings collapsed . Many Beijing office towers were evacuated , including the building housing the media offices for the organizers of the 2008 Summer Olympics . None of the Olympic venues were damaged . Meanwhile , a cargo train carrying 13 petrol tanks derailed in Hui County , Gansu , and caught on fire after the rail was distorted .
The war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the Japanese at Battle of Suixian-Zaoyang and 1st Battle of Changsha . After these victories , Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940 ; however , due to its low military-industrial capacity , it was repulsed by Japanese army in late March 1940 . In August of 1940 , Chinese communists launched an offensive in Central China ; in retaliation , Japan instituted the " Three Alls Policy " ( " Kill all , Burn all , Loot all " ) in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists . By 1941 the conflict had become a stalemate . Although Japan had occupied much of northern , central , and coastal China , the Nationalist Government had retreated to the interior with a provisional capital set up at Chungking while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in Shaanxi . In addition , Japanese control of northern and central China was somewhat tenuous , in that Japan was usually able to control railroads and the major cities ( " points and lines " ) , but did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast Chinese countryside . The Japanese found its aggression against the retreating and regrouping Chinese army was stalled by the mountainous terrain in southwestern China while the Communists organised widespread guerrilla and saboteur activities in northern and eastern China behind the Japanese front line .
Much of the current knowledge of memory has come from studying memory disorders , particularly amnesia . Loss of memory is known as amnesia . Amnesia can result from extensive damage to : ( a ) the regions of the medial temporal lobe , such as the hippocampus , dentate gyrus , subiculum , amygdala , the parahippocampal , entorhinal , and perirhinal cortices or the ( b ) midline diencephalic region , specifically the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus . There are many sorts of amnesia , and by studying their different forms , it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub-systems of the brain 's memory systems , and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain . Other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer 's disease and Parkinson 's disease can also affect memory and cognition . Hyperthymesia , or hyperthymesic syndrome , is a disorder that affects an individual 's autobiographical memory , essentially meaning that they can not forget small details that otherwise would not be stored . Korsakoff 's syndrome , also known as Korsakoff 's psychosis , amnesic-confabulatory syndrome , is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex .
In 1853 , Victoria gave birth to her eighth child , Leopold , with the aid of the new anaesthetic , chloroform . Victoria was so impressed by the relief it gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of her ninth and final child , Beatrice , despite opposition from members of the clergy , who considered it against biblical teaching , and members of the medical profession , who thought it dangerous . Victoria may have suffered from post-natal depression after many of her pregnancies . Letters from Albert to Victoria intermittently complain of her loss of self-control . For example , about a month after Leopold 's birth Albert complained in a letter to Victoria about her " continuance of hysterics " over a " miserable trifle " .
Nuclear claims between the U.S. and the Marshall Islands are ongoing , and health effects from these nuclear tests linger . Project 4.1 was a medical study conducted by the United States of those residents of the Bikini Atoll exposed to radioactive fallout . From 1956 to August 1998 , at least $ 759 million was paid to the Marshallese Islanders in compensation for their exposure to U.S. nuclear weapon testing .
Switzerland 's ecosystems can be particularly fragile , because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies . The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable , with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes , and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing . The climatic , geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change . Nevertheless , according to the 2014 Environmental Performance Index , Switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment , due to its high scores on environmental public health , its heavy reliance on renewable sources of energy ( hydropower and geothermal energy ) , and its control of greenhouse gas emissions .
Although STOVL aircraft are capable of taking off vertically from a spot on the deck , using the ramp and a running start is far more fuel efficient and permits a heavier launch weight . As catapults are unnecessary , carriers with this arrangement reduce weight , complexity , and space needed for complex steam or electromagnetic launching equipment , vertical landing aircraft also remove the need for arresting cables and related hardware . Russian , Chinese , and future Indian carriers include a ski-jump ramp for launching lightly loaded conventional fighter aircraft but recover using traditional carrier arresting cables and a tailhook on their aircraft .
Sanskrit linguist Madhav Deshpande says that when the term " Sanskrit " arose it was not thought of as a specific language set apart from other languages , but rather as a particularly refined or perfected manner of speaking . Knowledge of Sanskrit was a marker of social class and educational attainment in ancient India , and the language was taught mainly to members of the higher castes through the close analysis of Vyākaraṇins such as Pāṇini and Patanjali , who exhorted proper Sanskrit at all times , especially during ritual . Sanskrit , as the learned language of Ancient India , thus existed alongside the vernacular Prakrits , which were Middle Indo-Aryan languages . However , linguistic change led to an eventual loss of mutual intelligibility .
Paris was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century , when it had a colony of artists established in the city and in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times : Manet , Monet , Berthe Morisot , Gauguin , Renoir and others . The French Revolution and political and social change in France had a profound influence on art in the capital . Paris was central to the development of Romanticism in art , with painters such as Gericault . Impressionism , Art Nouveau , Symbolism , Fauvism Cubism and Art Deco movements all evolved in Paris . In the late 19th century , many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name for themselves . Artists such as Pablo Picasso , Henri Matisse , Vincent van Gogh , Paul Cézanne , Jean Metzinger , Albert Gleizes , Henri Rousseau , Marc Chagall , Amedeo Modigliani and many others became associated with Paris . Picasso , living in Montmartre , painted his famous La Famille de Saltimbanques and Les Demoiselles d'Avignon between 1905 and 1907 . Montmartre and Montparnasse became centres for artistic production .
The limited standardization of analog HDTV in the 1990s did not lead to global HDTV adoption as technical and economic constraints at the time did not permit HDTV to use bandwidths greater than normal television .
Isolated remains of Homo erectus in Hathnora in the Narmada Valley in central India indicate that India might have been inhabited since at least the Middle Pleistocene era , somewhere between 500,000 and 200,000 years ago . Tools crafted by proto-humans that have been dated back two million years have been discovered in the northwestern part of the subcontinent . The ancient history of the region includes some of South Asia 's oldest settlements and some of its major civilisations . The earliest archaeological site in the subcontinent is the palaeolithic hominid site in the Soan River valley . Soanian sites are found in the Sivalik region across what are now India , Pakistan , and Nepal .
Chopin 's life was covered in a BBC TV documentary Chopin – The Women Behind The Music ( 2010 ) , and in a 2010 documentary realised by Angelo Bozzolini and Roberto Prosseda for Italian television .
Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones . The " escape " character ( ESC , code 27 ) , for example , was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning . This is the same meaning of " escape " encountered in URL encodings , C language strings , and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning . Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed . In modern use , an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence , usually in the form of a so-called " ANSI escape code " ( or , more properly , a " Control Sequence Introducer " ) beginning with ESC followed by a " [ " ( left-bracket ) character . An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an out-of-band character used to terminate an operation , as in the TECO and vi text editors . In graphical user interface ( GUI ) and windowing systems , ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit ( terminate ) altogether .
Notably , a statute does not disappear automatically merely because it has been found unconstitutional ; it must be deleted by a subsequent statute . Many federal and state statutes have remained on the books for decades after they were ruled to be unconstitutional . However , under the principle of stare decisis , no sensible lower court will enforce an unconstitutional statute , and any court that does so will be reversed by the Supreme Court . Conversely , any court that refuses to enforce a constitutional statute ( where such constitutionality has been expressly established in prior cases ) will risk reversal by the Supreme Court .
Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League . The League 's decision to assign broadcasting rights to BSkyB in 1992 was at the time a radical decision , but one that has paid off . At the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market , as was charging fans to watch live televised football . However , a combination of Sky 's strategy , the quality of Premier League football and the public 's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League 's TV rights soar .
In a 1986 interview , Rocky Jones , the former club DJ who ran the D.J . International record label , does n't mention Importes Etc. , Frankie Knuckles , or the Warehouse by name , but agrees that " house " was a regional catch-all term for dance music , and that it was once synonymous with older disco music .
Glass remained a luxury material , and the disasters that overtook Late Bronze Age civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt . Indigenous development of glass technology in South Asia may have begun in 1730 BCE . In ancient China , though , glassmaking seems to have a late start , compared to ceramics and metal work . The term glass developed in the late Roman Empire . It was in the Roman glassmaking center at Trier , now in modern Germany , that the late-Latin term glesum originated , probably from a Germanic word for a transparent , lustrous substance . Glass objects have been recovered across the Roman empire in domestic , industrial and funerary contexts . [ citation needed ]
The study of genocide has mainly been focused towards the legal aspect of the term . By formally recognizing the act of genocide as a crime , involves the undergoing prosecution that begins with not only seeing genocide as outrageous past any moral standpoint but also may be a legal liability within international relations . When genocide is looked at in a general aspect it is viewed as the deliberate killing of a certain group . Yet is commonly seen to escape the process of trial and prosecution due to the fact that genocide is more often than not committed by the officials in power of a state or area . In 1648 before the term genocide had been coined , the Peace of Westphalia was established to protect ethnic , national , racial and in some instances religious groups . During the 19th century humanitarian intervention was needed due to the fact of conflict and justification of some of the actions executed by the military .
The higher-level phylogeny of the arthropods continues to be a matter of debate and research . In 2008 , researchers at Tufts University uncovered what they believe is the world 's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect , a 300 million-year-old specimen from the Carboniferous period . The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti , from the 396-million-year-old Rhynie chert . It may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect . This species already possessed dicondylic mandibles ( two articulations in the mandible ) , a feature associated with winged insects , suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time . Thus , the first insects probably appeared earlier , in the Silurian period .
The sky is usually clear above the desert and the sunshine duration is extremely high everywhere in the Sahara . Most of the desert enjoys more than 3,600 h of bright sunshine annually or over 82 % of the time and a wide area in the eastern part experiences in excess of 4,000 h of bright sunshine a year or over 91 % of the time , and the highest values are very close to the theoretical maximum value . A value of 4,300 h or 98 % of the time would be recorded in Upper Egypt ( Aswan , Luxor ) and in the Nubian Desert ( Wadi Halfa ) . The annual average direct solar irradiation is around 2,800 kWh/ ( m2 year ) in the Great Desert . The Sahara has a huge potential for solar energy production . The constantly high position of the sun , the extremely low relative humidity , the lack of vegetation and rainfall make the Great Desert the hottest continuously large area worldwide and certainly the hottest place on Earth during summertime in some spots . The average high temperature exceeds 38 °C ( 100.4 °F ) - 40 °C ( 104 °F ) during the hottest month nearly everywhere in the desert except at very high mountainous areas . The highest officially recorded average high temperature was 47 °C ( 116.6 °F ) in a remote desert town in the Algerian Desert called Bou Bernous with an elevation of 378 meters above sea level . It 's the world 's highest recorded average high temperature and only Death Valley , California rivals it . Other hot spots in Algeria such as Adrar , Timimoun , In Salah , Ouallene , Aoulef , Reggane with an elevation between 200 and 400 meters above sea level get slightly lower summer average highs around 46 °C ( 114.8 °F ) during the hottest months of the year . Salah , well known in Algeria for its extreme heat , has an average high temperature of 43.8 °C ( 110.8 °F ) , 46.4 °C ( 115.5 °F ) , 45.5 ( 113.9 °F ) . Furthermore , 41.9 °C ( 107.4 °F ) in June , July , August and September . In fact , there are even hotter spots in the Sahara , but they are located in extremely remote areas , especially in the Azalai , lying in northern Mali . The major part of the desert experiences around 3 – 5 months when the average high strictly exceeds 40 °C ( 104 °F ) . The southern central part of the desert experiences up to 6 – 7 months when the average high temperature strictly exceeds 40 °C ( 104 °F ) which shows the constancy and the length of the really hot season in the Sahara . Some examples of this are Bilma , Niger and Faya-Largeau , Chad . The annual average daily temperature exceeds 20 °C ( 68 °F ) everywhere and can approach 30 °C ( 86 °F ) in the hottest regions year-round . However , most of the desert has a value in excess of 25 °C ( 77 °F ) . The sand and ground temperatures are even more extreme . During daytime , the sand temperature is extremely high as it can easily reach 80 °C ( 176 °F ) or more . A sand temperature of 83.5 °C ( 182.3 °F ) has been recorded in Port Sudan . Ground temperatures of 72 °C ( 161.6 °F ) have been recorded in the Adrar of Mauritania and a value of 75 °C ( 167 °F ) has been measured in Borkou , northern Chad . Due to lack of cloud cover and very low humidity , the desert usually features high diurnal temperature variations between days and nights . However , it 's a myth that the nights are cold after extremely hot days in the Sahara . The average diurnal temperature range is typically between 13 °C ( 55.4 °F ) and 20 °C ( 68 °F ) . The lowest values are found along the coastal regions due to high humidity and are often even lower than 10 °C ( 50 °F ) , while the highest values are found in inland desert areas where the humidity is the lowest , mainly in the southern Sahara . Still , it 's true that winter nights can be cold as it can drop to the freezing point and even below , especially in high-elevation areas .
Once Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo , and to challenge Apollo , the god of the kithara , to a trial of skill . Tmolus , the mountain-god , was chosen to umpire . Pan blew on his pipes , and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower , Midas , who happened to be present . Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre . Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo , and all but Midas agreed with the judgment . He dissented and questioned the justice of the award . Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer , and caused them to become the ears of a donkey .
Catholicism arrived 400 years ago in the province and Protestantism 150 years ago . Zhejiang is one of the provinces of China with the largest concentrations of Protestants , especially notable in the city of Wenzhou . In 1999 Zhejiang 's Protestant population comprised 2.8 % of the provincial population , a small percentage but higher than the national average .
In Babylonian astronomy , records of the motions of the stars , planets , and the moon are left on thousands of clay tablets created by scribes . Even today , astronomical periods identified by Mesopotamian proto-scientists are still widely used in Western calendars such as the solar year and the lunar month . Using these data they developed arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the course of the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances of the Moon and planets and eclipses of the Sun and Moon . Only a few astronomers ' names are known , such as that of Kidinnu , a Chaldean astronomer and mathematician . Kiddinu 's value for the solar year is in use for today 's calendars . Babylonian astronomy was " the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena . " According to the historian A. Aaboe , " all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy , in the Hellenistic world , in India , in Islam , and in the West—if not indeed all subsequent endeavour in the exact sciences—depend upon Babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways . "
Baird Television Ltd. made Britain 's first television broadcast , on 30 September 1929 from its studio in Long Acre , London , via the BBC 's London transmitter , using the electromechanical system pioneered by John Logie Baird . This system used a vertically-scanned image of 30 lines – just enough resolution for a close-up of one person , and with a bandwidth low enough to use existing radio transmitters . Simultaneous transmission of sound and picture was achieved on 30 March 1930 , by using the BBC 's new twin transmitter at Brookmans Park . By late 1930 , 30 minutes of morning programmes were broadcast Monday to Friday , and 30 minutes at midnight on Tuesdays and Fridays , after BBC radio went off the air . Baird broadcasts via the BBC continued until June 1932 .
A small , landlocked kingdom , Swaziland is bordered in the North , West and South by the Republic of South Africa and by Mozambique in the East . Swaziland has a land area of 17,364 km2 . Swaziland has four separate geographical regions . These run from North to South and are determined by altitude . Swaziland is located at approximately 26°30 'S , 31°30'E . Swaziland has a wide variety of landscapes , from the mountains along the Mozambican border to savannas in the east and rain forest in the northwest . Several rivers flow through the country , such as the Great Usutu River .
At the Battle of Pulo Aura , which was probably the company 's most notable naval victory , Nathaniel Dance , Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the Warley , led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron , driving them off . Some six years earlier , on 28 January 1797 , five Indiamen , the Woodford , under Captain Charles Lennox , the Taunton-Castle , Captain Edward Studd , Canton , Captain Abel Vyvyan , and Boddam , Captain George Palmer , and Ocean , Captain John Christian Lochner , had encountered Admiral de Sercey and his squadron of frigates . On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety , and without any shots even being fired . Lastly , on 15 June 1795 , the General Goddard played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off St Helena .
Following filming in Mexico , and during a scheduled break , Craig was flown to New York to undergo minor surgery to fix his knee injury . It was reported that filming was not affected and he had returned to filming at Pinewood Studios as planned on 22 April .
After forming partnerships with multinational corporations such as Sprint , ITT and Telenor , these firms now offer the cheapest and clearest phone calls in Africa . These Somali telecommunication companies also provide services to every city , town and hamlet in Somalia . There are presently around 25 mainlines per 1,000 persons , and the local availability of telephone lines ( tele-density ) is higher than in neighboring countries ; three times greater than in adjacent Ethiopia . Prominent Somali telecommunications companies include Somtel Network , Golis Telecom Group , Hormuud Telecom , Somafone , Nationlink , Netco , Telcom and Somali Telecom Group . Hormuud Telecom alone grosses about $ 40 million a year . Despite their rivalry , several of these companies signed an interconnectivity deal in 2005 that allows them to set prices , maintain and expand their networks , and ensure that competition does not get out of control .
Confederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the Army of Northern Virginia , the Confederacy 's most famous army . The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at Bentonville , which was a futile attempt by Confederate General Joseph Johnston to slow Union General William Tecumseh Sherman 's advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865 . In April 1865 , after losing the Battle of Morrisville , Johnston surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place , in what is today Durham . North Carolina 's port city of Wilmington was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union , in February 1865 , after the Union won the nearby Second Battle of Fort Fisher , its major defense downriver .
However , some scholars contest the idea of a Proto-Euphratean language or one substrate language . It has been suggested by them and others , that the Sumerian language was originally that of the hunter and fisher peoples , who lived in the marshland and the Eastern Arabia littoral region , and were part of the Arabian bifacial culture . Reliable historical records begin much later ; there are none in Sumer of any kind that have been dated before Enmebaragesi ( c. 26th century BC ) . Professor Juris Zarins believes the Sumerians were settled along the coast of Eastern Arabia , today 's Persian Gulf region , before it flooded at the end of the Ice Age .
Bacteria do not have a membrane-bound nucleus , and their genetic material is typically a single circular DNA chromosome located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid . The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA . The phylum Planctomycetes and candidate phylum Poribacteria may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria , because they appear to have a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures . Like all living organisms , bacteria contain ribosomes , often grouped in chains called polyribosomes , for the production of proteins , but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and Archaea . Bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70S ( measured in Svedberg units ) : their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S . Some antibiotics bind specifically to 70S ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis . Those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger 80S ribosomes of eukaryotic cells and without harming the host .
When learning how to write hanja , students are taught to memorize the native Korean pronunciation for the hanja 's meaning and the Sino-Korean pronunciations ( the pronunciation based on the Chinese pronunciation of the characters ) for each hanja respectively so that students know what the syllable and meaning is for a particular hanja . For example , the name for the hanja 水 is 물 수 ( mul-su ) in which 물 ( mul ) is the native Korean pronunciation for " water " , while 수 ( su ) is the Sino-Korean pronunciation of the character . The naming of hanja is similar to if " water " were named " water-aqua " , " horse-equus " , or " gold-aurum " based on a hybridization of both the English and the Latin names . Other examples include 사람 인 ( saram-in ) for 人 " person/people " , 큰 대 ( keun-dae ) for 大 " big/large//great " , 작을 소 ( jakeul-so ) for 小 " small/little " , 아래 하 ( arae-ha ) for 下 " underneath/below/low " , 아비 부 ( abi-bu ) for 父 " father " , and 나라이름 한 ( naraimreum-han ) for 韓 " Han/Korea " .
In 2011 , Spielberg launched Falling Skies , a science fiction television series , on the TNT network . He developed the series with Robert Rodat and is credited as an executive producer . Spielberg is also producing the Fox TV series Terra Nova . Terra Nova begins in the year 2149 when all life on the planet Earth is threatened with extinction resulting in scientists opening a door that allows people to travel back 85 million years to prehistoric times . Spielberg also produced The River , Smash , Under the Dome , Extant and The Whispers , as well as a TV adaptation of Minority Report .
While the Federal District was ruled by the federal government through an appointed governor , the municipalities within it were autonomous , and this duality of powers created tension between the municipalities and the federal government for more than a century . In 1903 , Porfirio Díaz largely reduced the powers of the municipalities within the Federal District . Eventually , in December 1928 , the federal government decided to abolish all the municipalities of the Federal District . In place of the municipalities , the Federal District was divided into one " Central Department " and 13 delegaciones ( boroughs ) administered directly by the government of the Federal District . The Central Department was integrated by the former municipalities of Mexico City , Tacuba , Tacubaya and Mixcoac .
On Thursday , September 19 , 1985 , at 7:19 am local time , Mexico City was struck by an earthquake of magnitude 8.1 on the Richter scale . Although this earthquake was not as deadly or destructive as many similar events in Asia and other parts of Latin America , it proved to be a disaster politically for the one-party government . The government was paralyzed by its own bureaucracy and corruption , forcing ordinary citizens to create and direct their own rescue efforts and to reconstruct much of the housing that was lost as well .
Though situated in a remote part of the country , Himachal Pradesh has an active community of journalists and publishers . Several newspapers and magazines are published in more than one language , and their reach extends to almost all the Hindi-speaking states . Radio and TV have permeated significantly . Judging by the number of people writing to these media , there is a very large media-aware population in the state . All major English daily newspapers are available in Shimla and district headquarters . Aapka Faisla , Amar Ujala , Panjab Kesari , Divya Himachal are Hindi daily newspaper with local editions are read widely .
After the Dambusters raid in 1943 an entirely new system was developed that was required to knock down any low-flying aircraft with a single hit . The first attempt to produce such a system used a 50 mm gun , but this proved inaccurate and a new 55 mm gun replaced it . The system used a centralised control system including both search and targeting radar , which calculated the aim point for the guns after considering windage and ballistics , and then sent electrical commands to the guns , which used hydraulics to point themselves at high speeds . Operators simply fed the guns and selected the targets . This system , modern even by today 's standards , was in late development when the war ended .
South West Africa became known as Namibia by the UN when the General Assembly changed the territory 's name by Resolution 2372 ( XXII ) of 12 June 1968 . In 1978 the UN Security Council passed UN Resolution 435 which planned a transition toward independence for Namibia . Attempts to persuade South Africa to agree to the plan 's implementation were not successful until 1988 when the transition to independence finally started under a diplomatic agreement between South Africa , Angola and Cuba , with the USSR and the USA as observers , under which South Africa agreed to withdraw and demobilise its forces in Namibia . As a result , Cuba agreed to pull back its troops in southern Angola sent to support the MPLA in its war for control of Angola with UNITA .
World Trade Center Montevideo officially opened in 1998 , although work is still ongoing as of 2010 [ update ] . The complex is composed of three towers , two three-story buildings called World Trade Center Plaza and World Trade Center Avenue and a large central square called Towers Square . World Trade Center 1 was the first building to be inaugurated , in 1998 . [ citation needed ] It has 22 floors and 17,100 square metres of space . That same year the avenue and the auditorium were raised . World Trade Center 2 was inaugurated in 2002 , a twin tower of World Trade Center 1 . Finally , in 2009 , World Trade Center 3 and the World Trade Center Plaza and the Towers Square were inaugurated . It is located between the avenues Luis Alberto de Herrera and 26 de Marzo and has 19 floors and 27,000 square metres ( 290,000 sq ft ) of space . The 6,300-square-metre ( 68,000 sq ft ) [ citation needed ] World Trade Center Plaza is designed to be a centre of gastronomy opposite Towers Square and Bonavita St . Among the establishments on the plaza are Burger King , Walrus , Bamboo , Asia de Cuba , Gardenia Mvd , and La Claraboya Cafe .
With the occupation by Napoleon , Portugal began a slow but inexorable decline that lasted until the 20th century . This decline was hastened by the independence in 1822 of the country 's largest colonial possession , Brazil . In 1807 , as Napoleon 's army closed in on Lisbon , the Prince Regent João VI of Portugal transferred his court to Brazil and established Rio de Janeiro as the capital of the Portuguese Empire . In 1815 , Brazil was declared a Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal was united with it , forming a pluricontinental State , the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves .
Across continental Europe , but in France especially , booksellers and publishers had to negotiate censorship laws of varying strictness . The Encyclopédie , for example , narrowly escaped seizure and had to be saved by Malesherbes , the man in charge of the French censure . Indeed , many publishing companies were conveniently located outside France so as to avoid overzealous French censors . They would smuggle their merchandise across the border , where it would then be transported to clandestine booksellers or small-time peddlers . The records of clandestine booksellers may give a better representation of what literate Frenchmen might have truly read , since their clandestine nature provided a less restrictive product choice . In one case , political books were the most popular category , primarily libels and pamphlets . Readers were more interested in sensationalist stories about criminals and political corruption than they were in political theory itself . The second most popular category , " general works " ( those books " that did not have a dominant motif and that contained something to offend almost everyone in authority " ) demonstrated a high demand for generally low-brow subversive literature . However , these works never became part of literary canon , and are largely forgotten today as a result .
Together with caesium and gold ( both yellow ) , and osmium ( bluish ) , copper is one of only four elemental metals with a natural color other than gray or silver . Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air . The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells – the energy difference between these shells is such that it corresponds to orange light . The same mechanism accounts for the yellow color of gold and caesium .
Relatively few changes were made from the Release Preview to the final version ; these included updated versions of its pre-loaded apps , the renaming of Windows Explorer to File Explorer , the replacement of the Aero Glass theme from Windows Vista and 7 with a new flat and solid-colored theme , and the addition of new background options for the Start screen , lock screen , and desktop . Prior to its general availability on October 26 , 2012 , updates were released for some of Windows 8 's bundled apps , and a " General Availability Cumulative Update " ( which included fixes to improve performance , compatibility , and battery life ) was released on Tuesday , October 9 , 2012 . Microsoft indicated that due to improvements to its testing infrastructure , general improvements of this nature are to be released more frequently through Windows Update instead of being relegated to OEMs and service packs only .
White LEDs can also be made by coating near-ultraviolet ( NUV ) LEDs with a mixture of high-efficiency europium-based phosphors that emit red and blue , plus copper and aluminium-doped zinc sulfide ( ZnS : Cu , Al ) that emits green . This is a method analogous to the way fluorescent lamps work . This method is less efficient than blue LEDs with YAG : Ce phosphor , as the Stokes shift is larger , so more energy is converted to heat , but yields light with better spectral characteristics , which render color better . Due to the higher radiative output of the ultraviolet LEDs than of the blue ones , both methods offer comparable brightness . A concern is that UV light may leak from a malfunctioning light source and cause harm to human eyes or skin .
The expression of genes encoded in DNA begins by transcribing the gene into RNA , a second type of nucleic acid that is very similar to DNA , but whose monomers contain the sugar ribose rather than deoxyribose . RNA also contains the base uracil in place of thymine . RNA molecules are less stable than DNA and are typically single-stranded . Genes that encode proteins are composed of a series of three-nucleotide sequences called codons , which serve as the " words " in the genetic " language " . The genetic code specifies the correspondence during protein translation between codons and amino acids . The genetic code is nearly the same for all known organisms . :4.1
When Link enters the Twilight Realm , the void that corrupts parts of Hyrule , he transforms into a wolf . [ h ] He is eventually able to transform between his Hylian and wolf forms at will . As a wolf , Link loses the ability to use his sword , shield , or any secondary items ; he instead attacks by biting , and defends primarily by dodging attacks . However , " Wolf Link " gains several key advantages in return—he moves faster than he does as a human ( though riding Epona is still faster ) and digs holes to create new passages and uncover buried items , and has improved senses , including the ability to follow scent trails . [ i ] He also carries Midna , a small imp-like creature who gives him hints , uses an energy field to attack enemies , helps him jump long distances , and eventually allows Link to " warp " to any of several preset locations throughout the overworld . [ j ] Using Link 's wolf senses , the player can see and listen to the wandering spirits of those affected by the Twilight , as well as hunt for enemy ghosts named Poes . [ k ]
In addition to and independent of the division into suras , there are various ways of dividing the Quran into parts of approximately equal length for convenience in reading . The 30 juz ' ( plural ajzāʼ ) can be used to read through the entire Quran in a month . Some of these parts are known by names—which are the first few words by which the juzʼ starts . A juz ' is sometimes further divided into two ḥizb ( plural aḥzāb ) , and each hizb subdivided into four rubʻ al-ahzab . The Quran is also divided into seven approximately equal parts , manzil ( plural manāzil ) , for it to be recited in a week .
In August 1836 , two real estate entrepreneurs—Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen—from New York , purchased 6,642 acres ( 26.88 km2 ) of land along Buffalo Bayou with the intent of founding a city . The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston , the popular general at the Battle of San Jacinto , who was elected President of Texas in September 1836 . The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states . Sizable numbers , however , came through the domestic slave trade . New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South , but there were slave dealers in Houston . Thousands of enslaved African-Americans lived near the city before the Civil War . Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations , while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs . In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city 's population was enslaved . A few slaves , perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865 , came through the illegal African trade . Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state . They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans , whose numbers nearly tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860 , from 58,000 to 182,566 .
In Thailand , a kingdom that has had a constitution since the initial attempt to overthrow the absolute monarchy system in 1932 , the rule of law has been more of a principle than actual practice . [ citation needed ] Ancient prejudices and political bias have been present in the three branches of government with each of their foundings , and justice has been processed formally according to the law but in fact more closely aligned with royalist principles that are still advocated in the 21st century . [ citation needed ] In November 2013 , Thailand faced still further threats to the rule of law when the executive branch rejected a supreme court decision over how to select senators .

The Karabakh war ended after a Russian-brokered cease-fire was put in place in 1994 . The war was a success for the Karabakh Armenian forces who managed to capture 16 % of Azerbaijan 's internationally recognised territory including Nagorno-Karabakh itself . Since then , Armenia and Azerbaijan have held peace talks , mediated by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) . The status of Karabakh has yet to be determined . The economies of both countries have been hurt in the absence of a complete resolution and Armenia 's borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan remain closed . By the time both Azerbaijan and Armenia had finally agreed to a ceasefire in 1994 , an estimated 30,000 people had been killed and over a million had been displaced .
Following similar conflicts over modernism , the Southern Baptist Convention adhered to conservative theology as its official position . Two new Baptist groups were formed by moderate Southern Baptists who disagreed with the direction in which the Southern Baptist Convention was heading : the Alliance of Baptists in 1987 and the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship in 1991 . Members of both groups originally identified as Southern Baptist , but over time the groups " became permanent new families of Baptists . "
In 2004 the old Drake Circus shopping centre and Charles Cross car park were demolished and replaced by the latest Drake Circus Shopping Centre , which opened in October 2006 . It received negative feedback before opening when David Mackay said it was already " ten years out of date " . In contrast , the Theatre Royal 's production and education centre , TR2 , which was built on wasteland at Cattedown , was a runner-up for the RIBA Stirling Prize for Architecture in 2003 .
According to the Crisis Group , since Myanmar transitioned to a new government in August 2011 , the country 's human rights record has been improving . Previously giving Myanmar its lowest rating of 7 , the 2012 Freedom in the World report also notes improvement , giving Myanmar a 6 for improvements in civil liberties and political rights , the release of political prisoners , and a loosening of restrictions . In 2013 , Myanmar improved yet again , receiving a score of five in civil liberties and a six in political freedoms
Changes also took place within the recruitment and composition of armies . The use of the national or feudal levy was gradually replaced by paid troops of domestic retinues or foreign mercenaries . The practice was associated with Edward III of England and the condottieri of the Italian city-states . All over Europe , Swiss soldiers were in particularly high demand . At the same time , the period also saw the emergence of the first permanent armies . It was in Valois France , under the heavy demands of the Hundred Years ' War , that the armed forces gradually assumed a permanent nature .
The system was originally targeted for release in the spring of 1985 , but the release date was pushed back . After test-marketing in the New York City area in late fall , retailers had reportedly stated the system " failed miserably " . [ contradictory ] While others stated that Nintendo had an excellent nine-week market test in New York last fall Due to the moderate success launch in New York City , Nintendo tried a second time ; the system was test-marketed further beginning in February 1986 , with the nationwide release occurring in September 1986 .
It was unclear if Shell would recommence drilling in mid-2013 , following the " Kulluk " incident and , in February 2013 , the corporation stated that it would " pause " its closely watched drilling project off the Alaskan coast in 2013 , and will instead prepare for future exploration . In January 2014 , the corporation announced the extension of the suspension of its drilling program in the Arctic , with chief executive van Beurden explaining that the project is " under review " due to both market and internal issues .
On 22 May 2015 , Sun reporter Anthony France was found guilty of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office between 2008 and 2011 . France’s trial followed the London Metropolitan Police 's Operation Elveden , an ongoing investigation into alleged payments to police and officials in exchange for information . He had paid a total of more than £22,000 to PC Timothy Edwards , an anti-terrorism police officer based at Heathrow Airport . The police officer had already pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office and given a two-year gaol sentence in 2014 , but the jury in France’s trial was not informed of this . Following the passing of the guilty verdict , the officer leading Operation Elveden , Detective Chief Superintendent Gordon Briggs said France and Edwards had been in a " long-term , corrupt relationship " .
Campus Martius , a reconfiguration of downtown 's main intersection as a new park was opened in 2004 . The park has been cited as one of the best public spaces in the United States . The city 's riverfront has been the focus of redevelopment , following successful examples of other older industrial cities . In 2001 , the first portion of the International Riverfront was completed as a part of the city 's 300th anniversary celebration , with miles of parks and associated landscaping completed in succeeding years . In 2011 , the Port Authority Passenger Terminal opened with the river walk connecting Hart Plaza to the Renaissance Center .
The structure of a gene consists of many elements of which the actual protein coding sequence is often only a small part . These include DNA regions that are not transcribed as well as untranslated regions of the RNA .
One early attempt at lengthening the playing time should be mentioned . At least one manufacturer in the early 1920s , World Records , produced records that played at a constant linear velocity , controlled by Noel Pemberton Billing 's patented add-on governor device . As these were played from the outside to the inside , the rotational speed of the records increased as reproduction progressed . This action is similar ( although in reverse ) to that on the modern compact disc and the CLV version of its predecessor , the Philips Laser Disc .
Most British pubs still have decorated signs hanging over their doors , and these retain their original function of enabling the identification of the pub . Today 's pub signs almost always bear the name of the pub , both in words and in pictorial representation . The more remote country pubs often have stand-alone signs directing potential customers to their door .
Columbia founded Epic Records in 1953 . In 1956 , Conkling left Columbia , he would help establish the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences before eventually becoming the first president of the newly launched Warner Bros. Records , and Goddard Lieberson began the first of two stints as head of the record company . In 1958 , Columbia founded another label , Date Records , which initially issued rockabilly music .
The Times faced financial extinction in 1890 under Arthur Fraser Walter , but it was rescued by an energetic editor , Charles Frederic Moberly Bell . During his tenure ( 1890–1911 ) , The Times became associated with selling the Encyclopædia Britannica using aggressive American marketing methods introduced by Horace Everett Hooper and his advertising executive , Henry Haxton . Due to legal fights between the Britannica 's two owners , Hooper and Walter Montgomery Jackson , The Times severed its connection in 1908 and was bought by pioneering newspaper magnate , Alfred Harmsworth , later Lord Northcliffe .
In 1997 , a year after the divorce , Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris . The Queen was on holiday with her extended family at Balmoral . Diana 's two sons by Charles—Princes William and Harry—wanted to attend church and so the Queen and Prince Philip took them that morning . After that single public appearance , for five days the Queen and the Duke shielded their grandsons from the intense press interest by keeping them at Balmoral where they could grieve in private , but the royal family 's seclusion and the failure to fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace caused public dismay . Pressured by the hostile reaction , the Queen agreed to return to London and do a live television broadcast on 5 September , the day before Diana 's funeral . In the broadcast , she expressed admiration for Diana and her feelings " as a grandmother " for the two princes . As a result , much of the public hostility evaporated .
Uranium-238 is the most stable isotope of uranium , with a half-life of about 4.468×109 years , roughly the age of the Earth . Uranium-235 has a half-life of about 7.13×108 years , and uranium-234 has a half-life of about 2.48×105 years . For natural uranium , about 49 % of its alpha rays are emitted by each of 238U atom , and also 49 % by 234U ( since the latter is formed from the former ) and about 2.0 % of them by the 235U . When the Earth was young , probably about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235 , but the percentage of 234U was probably much lower than this .
Ashkenazi Jews have a noted history of achievement in Western societies in the fields of exact and social sciences , literature , finance , politics , media , and others . In those societies where they have been free to enter any profession , they have a record of high occupational achievement , entering professions and fields of commerce where higher education is required . Ashkenazi Jews have won a large number of the Nobel awards . While they make up about 2 % of the U.S. population , 27 % of United States Nobel prize winners in the 20th century , a quarter of Fields Medal winners , 25 % of ACM Turing Award winners , half the world 's chess champions , including 8 % of the top 100 world chess players , and a quarter of Westinghouse Science Talent Search winners have Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry .
In the mainly Christian Indian state of Mizoram , the Presbyterian denomination is the largest denomination ; it was brought to the region with missionaries from Wales in 1894 . Prior to Mizoram , the Welsh Presbyterians ( missionaries ) started venturing into the north-east of India through the Khasi Hills ( presently located within the state of Meghalaya in India ) and established Presbyterian churches all over the Khasi Hills from the 1840s onwards . Hence there is a strong presence of Presbyterians in Shillong ( the present capital of Meghalaya ) and the areas adjoining it . The Welsh missionaries built their first church in Sohra ( aka Cherrapunji ) in 1846 . Presbyterians participated in the mergers that resulted in the Church of North India and the Church of South India.Sohra
Outstanding debts were also agreed and the company permitted to export 250 tons of saltpetre . Again in 1673 , Banks successfully negotiated another contract for 700 tons of saltpetre at £37,000 between the king and the company . So urgent was the need to supply the armed forces in the United Kingdom , America and elsewhere that the authorities sometimes turned a blind eye on the untaxed sales . One governor of the company was even reported as saying in 1864 that he would rather have the saltpetre made than the tax on salt .
When their migratory movements ended , there appeared among the Slavs the first rudiments of state organizations , each headed by a prince with a treasury and a defense force . Moreover , it was the beginnings of class differentiation , and nobles pledged allegiance either to the Frankish/ Holy Roman Emperors or the Byzantine Emperors .
In 1922 , John Jacob Astor , son of the 1st Viscount Astor , bought The Times from the Northcliffe estate . The paper gained a measure of notoriety in the 1930s with its advocacy of German appeasement ; then-editor Geoffrey Dawson was closely allied with those in the government who practised appeasement , most notably Neville Chamberlain .
North Raleigh is an expansive , diverse , and fast-growing suburban area of the city that is home to established neighborhoods to the south along with many newly built subdivisions and along its northern fringes . The area generally falls North of Millbrook Road . It is primarily suburban with large shopping areas . Primary neighborhoods and subdivisions in North Raleigh include Harrington Grove , Springdale , Dominion Park , Bedford , Bent Tree , Brentwood , Brier Creek , Brookhaven , Black Horse Run , Coachman 's Trail , Crossgate , Crosswinds , Falls River , Hidden Valley , Lake Park , North Haven , North Ridge , Oakcroft , Shannon Woods , Six Forks Station , Springdale , Stonebridge , Stone Creek , Stonehenge , Summerfield , Valley Estates , Wakefield , Weathersfield , Windsor Forest , and Wood Valley . The area is served by a number of primary transportation corridors including Glenwood Avenue U.S. Route 70 , Interstate 540 , Wake Forest Road , Millbrook Road , Lynn Road , Six Forks Road , Spring Forest Road , Creedmoor Road , Leesville Road , Strickland Road , and North Hills Drive .
Namibia is the driest country in sub-Saharan Africa and depends largely on groundwater . With an average rainfall of about 350 mm per annum , the highest rainfall occurs in the Caprivi in the northeast ( about 600 mm per annum ) and decreases in a westerly and southwesterly direction to as little as 50 mm and less per annum at the coast . The only perennial rivers are found on the national borders with South Africa , Angola , Zambia , and the short border with Botswana in the Caprivi . In the interior of the country surface water is available only in the summer months when rivers are in flood after exceptional rainfalls . Otherwise , surface water is restricted to a few large storage dams retaining and damming up these seasonal floods and their runoff . Thus , where people don’t live near perennial rivers or make use of the storage dams , they are dependent on groundwater . The advantage of using groundwater sources is that even isolated communities and those economic activities located far from good surface water sources such as mining , agriculture , and tourism can be supplied from groundwater over nearly 80 % of the country .
As the 10th century progressed , the Khazars were no longer able to command tribute from the Volga Bulgars , and their relationship with the Byzantines deteriorated , as Byzantium increasingly allied with the Pechenegs against them . The Pechenegs were thus secure to raid the lands of the Khazars from their base between the Volga and Don rivers , allowing them to expand to the west . Rus ' relations with the Pechenegs were complex , as the groups alternately formed alliances with and against one another . The Pechenegs were nomads roaming the steppe raising livestock which they traded with the Rus ' for agricultural goods and other products . The lucrative Rus ' trade with the Byzantine Empire had to pass through Pecheneg-controlled territory , so the need for generally peaceful relations was essential . Nevertheless , while the Primary Chronicle reports the Pechenegs entering Rus ' territory in 915 and then making peace , they were waging war with one another again in 920 . Pechenegs are reported assisting the Rus ' in later campaigns against the Byzantines , yet allied with the Byzantines against the Rus ' at other times .
By the 1890s the profound effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered , setting off a search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations for the development of new drugs . The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock , and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance . In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine , which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt . Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state , and licensed the technology to Parke Davis . Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin . Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks , and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 ( Primatene Mist ) . By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion .
According to a tradition first reported by Sulcard in about 1080 , a church was founded at the site ( then known as Thorn Ey ( Thorn Island ) ) in the 7th century , at the time of Mellitus , a Bishop of London . Construction of the present church began in 1245 , on the orders of King Henry III .
Companies with limited resources may choose to engage in only a few of these activities , while larger organizations may employ a full spectrum of communications . Since it is difficult to develop such a broad range of skills , communications professionals often specialize in one or two of these areas but usually have at least a working knowledge of most of them . By far , the most important qualifications communications professionals can possess are excellent writing ability , good 'people ' skills , and the capacity to think critically and strategically .
Himachal is extremely rich in hydro electric resources . The state has about 25 % of the national potential in this respect . It has been estimated that about 20,300MW of hydro electric power can be generated in the State by constructing various major , medium , small and mini/micro hydel projects on the five river basins . The state is also the first state in India to achieve the goal of having a bank account for every family . [ citation needed ] As per the current prices , the total GDP was estimated at ₹ 254 billion as against ₹ 230 billion in the year 2004–05 , showing an increase of 10.5 % . The recent years witnessed quick establishment of International Entrepreneurship . Luxury hotels , food and franchisees of recognised brands e.g . Mc Donalds , KFC and Pizza hut have rapidly spread .
Jonathan Bellman writes that modern concert performance style—set in the " conservatory " tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools , and suitable for large auditoria or recordings—militates against what is known of Chopin 's more intimate performance technique . The composer himself said to a pupil that " concerts are never real music , you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art . " Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance , Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him , such as " always crescendo to a high note " , but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing , rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring . Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin " has created a kind of chromatic embroidery ... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe ... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn " . Hiller wrote that " What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment , in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers . "
On April 4 , 2008 , Beyoncé married Jay Z . She publicly revealed their marriage in a video montage at the listening party for her third studio album , I Am ... Sasha Fierce , in Manhattan 's Sony Club on October 22 , 2008 . I Am ... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18 , 2008 in the United States . The album formally introduces Beyoncé 's alter ego Sasha Fierce , conceived during the making of her 2003 single " Crazy in Love " , selling 482,000 copies in its first week , debuting atop the Billboard 200 , and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive number-one album in the US . The album featured the number-one song " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) " and the top-five songs " If I Were a Boy " and " Halo " . Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career , " Halo " 's success in the US helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s . It also included the successful " Sweet Dreams " , and singles " Diva " , " Ego " , " Broken-Hearted Girl " and " Video Phone " . The music video for " Single Ladies " has been parodied and imitated around the world , spawning the " first major dance craze " of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star . The video has won several awards , including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards , the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards , and the 2009 BET Awards . At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards , the video was nominated for nine awards , ultimately winning three including Video of the Year . Its failure to win the Best Female Video category , which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift 's " You Belong with Me " , led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyoncé improvising a re-presentation of Swift 's award during her own acceptance speech . In March 2009 , Beyoncé embarked on the I Am ... World Tour , her second headlining worldwide concert tour , consisting of 108 shows , grossing $ 119.5 million .
Roman city life and culture changed greatly in the early Middle Ages . Although Italian cities remained inhabited , they contracted significantly in size . Rome , for instance , shrank from a population of hundreds of thousands to around 30,000 by the end of the 6th century . Roman temples were converted into Christian churches and city walls remained in use . In Northern Europe , cities also shrank , while civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials . The establishment of new kingdoms often meant some growth for the towns chosen as capitals . Although there had been Jewish communities in many Roman cities , the Jews suffered periods of persecution after the conversion of the empire to Christianity . Officially they were tolerated , if subject to conversion efforts , and at times were even encouraged to settle in new areas .
He turned to medicine at 16 , and not only learned medical theory , but also by gratuitous attendance of the sick had , according to his own account , discovered new methods of treatment . The teenager achieved full status as a qualified physician at age 18 , and found that " Medicine is no hard and thorny science , like mathematics and metaphysics , so I soon made great progress ; I became an excellent doctor and began to treat patients , using approved remedies . " The youthful physician 's fame spread quickly , and he treated many patients without asking for payment .
In 1989 , Troiden proposed a four-stage model for the development of homosexual sexual identity . The first stage , known as sensitization , usually starts in childhood , and is marked by the child 's becoming aware of same-sex attractions . The second stage , identity confusion , tends to occur a few years later . In this stage , the youth is overwhelmed by feelings of inner turmoil regarding their sexual orientation , and begins to engage sexual experiences with same-sex partners . In the third stage of identity assumption , which usually takes place a few years after the adolescent has left home , adolescents begin to come out to their family and close friends , and assumes a self-definition as gay , lesbian , or bisexual . In the final stage , known as commitment , the young adult adopts their sexual identity as a lifestyle . Therefore , this model estimates that the process of coming out begins in childhood , and continues through the early to mid 20s . This model has been contested , and alternate ideas have been explored in recent years .
The wildcard round returned in season eight , wherein there were three groups of twelve , with three contestants moving forward – the highest male , the highest female , and the next highest-placed singer - for each night , and four wildcards were chosen by the judges to produce a final 13 . Starting season ten , the girls and boys perform on separate nights . In seasons ten and eleven , five of each gender were chosen , and three wildcards were chosen by the judges to form a final 13 . In season twelve , the top twenty semifinalists were split into gender groups , with five of each gender advancing to form the final 10 . In season thirteen , there were thirty semifinalists , but only twenty semifinalists ( ten for each gender ) were chosen by the judges to perform on the live shows , with five in each gender and three wildcards chosen by the judges composing the final 13 .
Pitt now prepared to send troops into Germany ; and both Marlborough and Sackville , disgusted by what they perceived as the futility of the " descents " , obtained commissions in that army . The elderly General Bligh was appointed to command a new " descent " , escorted by Howe . The campaign began propitiously with the Raid on Cherbourg . Covered by naval bombardment , the army drove off the French force detailed to oppose their landing , captured Cherbourg , and destroyed its fortifications , docks , and shipping .
Estonia co-operates with Latvia and Lithuania in several trilateral Baltic defence co-operation initiatives , including Baltic Battalion ( BALTBAT ) , Baltic Naval Squadron ( BALTRON ) , Baltic Air Surveillance Network ( BALTNET ) and joint military educational institutions such as the Baltic Defence College in Tartu . Future co-operation will include sharing of national infrastructures for training purposes and specialisation of training areas ( BALTTRAIN ) and collective formation of battalion-sized contingents for use in the NATO rapid-response force . In January 2011 the Baltic states were invited to join NORDEFCO , the defence framework of the Nordic countries .
In the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries , John Kerry defeated several Democratic rivals , including Sen. John Edwards ( D-North Carolina . ) , former Vermont Governor Howard Dean and retired Army General Wesley Clark . His victory in the Iowa caucuses is widely believed to be the tipping point where Kerry revived his sagging campaign in New Hampshire and the February 3 , 2004 , primary states like Arizona , South Carolina and New Mexico . Kerry then went on to win landslide victories in Nevada and Wisconsin . Kerry thus won the Democratic nomination to run for President of the United States against incumbent George W. Bush . On July 6 , 2004 , he announced his selection of John Edwards as his running mate . Democratic strategist Bob Shrum , who was Kerry 's 2004 campaign adviser , wrote an article in Time magazine claiming that after the election , Kerry had said that he wished he 'd never picked Edwards , and that the two have since stopped speaking to each other . In a subsequent appearance on ABC 's This Week , Kerry refused to respond to Shrum 's allegation , calling it a " ridiculous waste of time . "
At the same time , naval innovations led to a German domination of trade in the Baltic Sea and parts of Eastern Europe through the Hanseatic League . Along the trade routes , Hanseatic trade stations became centers of the German culture . German town law ( Stadtrecht ) was promoted by the presence of large , relatively wealthy German populations , their influence and political power . Thus people who would be considered " Germans " , with a common culture , language , and worldview different from that of the surrounding rural peoples , colonized trading towns as far north of present-day Germany as Bergen ( in Norway ) , Stockholm ( in Sweden ) , and Vyborg ( now in Russia ) . The Hanseatic League was not exclusively German in any ethnic sense : many towns who joined the league were outside the Holy Roman Empire and a number of them may only loosely be characterized as German . The Empire itself was not entirely German either . It had a multi-ethnic and multi-lingual structure , some of the smaller ethnicities and languages used at different times were Dutch , Italian , French , Czech and Polish .
However , by the turn of the 1990s the downward trend was starting to reverse ; England had been successful in the 1990 FIFA World Cup , reaching the semi-finals . UEFA , European football 's governing body , lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990 ( resulting in Manchester United lifting the UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup in 1991 ) and the Taylor Report on stadium safety standards , which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster , was published in January of that year .
The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction until late in the 20th century , replacing the phonograph cylinder record–with which it had co-existed from the late 1880s through to the 1920s–by the late 1920s . Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as compact cassette were mass-marketed . By the late 1980s , digital media , in the form of the compact disc , had gained a larger market share , and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991 . From the 1990s to the 2010s , records continued to be manufactured and sold on a much smaller scale , and were especially used by disc jockeys ( DJ ) s , released by artists in some genres , and listened to by a niche market of audiophiles . The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century – 9.2 million records were sold in the U.S. in 2014 , a 260 % increase since 2009 . Likewise , in the UK sales have increased five-fold from 2009 to 2014 .

Orthodox Judaism considers views on the part of Jews who depart from traditional Jewish principles of faith heretical . In addition , the more right-wing groups within Orthodox Judaism hold that all Jews who reject the simple meaning of Maimonides 's 13 principles of Jewish faith are heretics . As such , most of Orthodox Judaism considers Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism heretical movements , and regards most of Conservative Judaism as heretical . The liberal wing of Modern Orthodoxy is more tolerant of Conservative Judaism , particularly its right wing , as there is some theological and practical overlap between these groups .
Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide lactose to its component parts , glucose and galactose . Glucose and galactose can be absorbed by the small intestine . Approximately 65 percent of the adult population produce only small amounts of lactase and are unable to eat unfermented milk-based foods . This is commonly known as lactose intolerance . Lactose intolerance varies widely by ethnic heritage ; more than 90 percent of peoples of east Asian descent are lactose intolerant , in contrast to about 5 percent of people of northern European descent .
In 1820-1830’s the Ottoman Empire endured a number of strikes which challenged the existence of the country . The Greek Uprising ( began in the spring of 1821 ) evidenced internal and military weakness of Ottoman Empire and caused severe atrocities by Ottoman military forces ( see Chios massacre ) . The disbandment of the centuries-old Janissary corps by Sultan Mahmud II on 15 June 1826 ( Auspicious Incident ) was a good deed for the country in the longer term , but it has deprived the country from its army forces for the nearest future . In 1827 the allied Anglo-Franco-Russian fleet destroyed almost all the Ottoman naval forces during the Battle of Navarino . In 1830 Greece becomes an independent state after 10 years of independence war and the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829 . According to the Treaty of Adrianople ( 1829 ) Russian and European commercial ships were authorized to freely pass through Black Sea straits , Serbia received autonomy , and Danubian Principalities ( Moldavia and Walachia ) became the territories under Russian protection .
As the Nintendo Entertainment System grew in popularity and entered millions of American homes , some small video rental shops began buying their own copies of NES games , and renting them out to customers for around the same price as a video cassette rental for a few days . Nintendo received no profit from the practice beyond the initial cost of their game , and unlike movie rentals , a newly released game could hit store shelves and be available for rent on the same day . Nintendo took steps to stop game rentals , but did n't take any formal legal action until Blockbuster Video began to make game rentals a large-scale service . Nintendo claimed that allowing customers to rent games would significantly hurt sales and drive up the cost of games . Nintendo lost the lawsuit , but did win on a claim of copyright infringement . Blockbuster was banned from including original , copyrighted instruction booklets with their rented games . In compliance with the ruling , Blockbuster produced their own short instructions—usually in the form of a small booklet , card , or label stuck on the back of the rental box—that explained the game 's basic premise and controls . Video rental shops continued the practice of renting video games and still do today .
Politically , the Marshall Islands is a presidential republic in free association with the United States , with the US providing defense , subsidies , and access to U.S. based agencies such as the FCC and the USPS . With few natural resources , the islands ' wealth is based on a service economy , as well as some fishing and agriculture ; aid from the United States represents a large percentage of the islands ' gross domestic product . The country uses the United States dollar as its currency .
During the British Raj , famines in India , often attributed to failed government policies , were some of the worst ever recorded , including the Great Famine of 1876–78 in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million people died and the Indian famine of 1899–1900 in which 1.25 to 10 million people died . The Third Plague Pandemic in the mid-19th century killed 10 million people in India . Despite persistent diseases and famines , the population of the Indian subcontinent , which stood at about 125 million in 1750 , had reached 389 million by 1941 .
Charles Darwin 's grandfather Erasmus Darwin outlined a hypothesis of transmutation of species in the 1790s , and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809 . Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity , adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse . This process was later called Lamarckism . Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity , in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction . Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos , and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies . Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas , holding that unrelated , fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs . His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction , which he explained by local catastrophes , followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species .
Nigeria was ranked 30th in the world in terms of GDP ( PPP ) in 2012 .

Madonna 's initial music videos reflected her American and Hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamor . She was able to transmit her avant-garde downtown New York fashion sense to the American audience . The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the True Blue era . Author Douglas Kellner noted , " such 'multiculturalism ' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences . " Madonna 's Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time , in the form of boleros and layered skirts , accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of " La Isla Bonita " .
The popularization of the Jewish chant may be found in the writings of the Jewish philosopher Philo , born 20 BCE . Weaving together Jewish and Greek thought , Philo promoted praise without instruments , and taught that " silent singing " ( without even vocal chords ) was better still . This view parted with the Jewish scriptures , where Israel offered praise with instruments by God 's own command ( 2 Chronicles 29:25 ) . The shofar is the only temple instrument still being used today in the synagogue , and it is only used from Rosh Chodesh Elul through the end of Yom Kippur . The shofar is used by itself , without any vocal accompaniment , and is limited to a very strictly defined set of sounds and specific places in the synagogue service .
Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits , dogs were initially selected for their behaviors . In 2016 , a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs . These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution , and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication . These genes have been shown to have an impact on the catecholamine synthesis pathway , with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response ( i.e . selection for tameness ) , and emotional processing . Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared to wolves . Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds , indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation .
The vocabulary ( mainly abstract and literary words ) , principles of word formations , and , to some extent , inflections and literary style of Russian have been also influenced by Church Slavonic , a developed and partly russified form of the South Slavic Old Church Slavonic language used by the Russian Orthodox Church . However , the East Slavic forms have tended to be used exclusively in the various dialects that are experiencing a rapid decline . In some cases , both the East Slavic and the Church Slavonic forms are in use , with many different meanings . For details , see Russian phonology and History of the Russian language .
The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as Ravn Alaska , PenAir , and Frontier Flying Service . The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan , the most popular aircraft in use in the state . Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities . The program requires 70 % of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities .
Forbes magazine began reporting on Beyoncé 's earnings in 2008 , calculating that the $ 80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008 , for her music , tour , films and clothing line made her the world 's best-paid music personality at the time , above Madonna and Celine Dion .

The town experienced major expansion during the Victorian era . The Southampton Docks company had been formed in 1835 . In October 1838 the foundation stone of the docks was laid and the first dock opened in 1842 . The structural and economic development of docks continued for the next few decades . The railway link to London was fully opened in May 1840 . Southampton subsequently became known as The Gateway to the Empire .
After working on various solo projects during 1988 ( including Mercury 's collaboration with Montserrat Caballé , Barcelona ) , the band released The Miracle in 1989 . The album continued the direction of A Kind of Magic , using a pop-rock sound mixed with a few heavy numbers . It spawned the European hits " I Want It All " , " Breakthru " , " The Invisible Man " , " Scandal " , and " The Miracle " . The Miracle also began a change in direction of Queen 's songwriting philosophy . Since the band 's beginning , nearly all songs had been written by and credited to a single member , with other members adding minimally . With The Miracle , the band 's songwriting became more collaborative , and they vowed to credit the final product only to Queen as a group .
Some contemporaries alleged that Bonaparte was put under house arrest at Nice for his association with the Robespierres following their fall in the Thermidorian Reaction in July 1794 , but Napoleon 's secretary Bourrienne disputed the allegation in his memoirs . According to Bourrienne , jealousy was responsible , between the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy ( with whom Napoleon was seconded at the time ) . Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defense in a letter to the commissar Salicetti , and he was subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing .
On 26 February 2015 , the FCC ruled in favor of net neutrality by adopting Title II ( common carrier ) of the Communications Act of 1934 and Section 706 in the Telecommunications act of 1996 to the Internet .

West got his big break in the year 2000 , when he began to produce for artists on Roc-A-Fella Records . West came to achieve recognition and is often credited with revitalizing Jay-Z 's career with his contributions to the rap mogul 's influential 2001 album The Blueprint . The Blueprint is consistently ranked among the greatest hip-hop albums , and the critical and financial success of the album generated substantial interest in West as a producer . Serving as an in-house producer for Roc-A-Fella Records , West produced records for other artists from the label , including Beanie Sigel , Freeway , and Cam'ron . He also crafted hit songs for Ludacris , Alicia Keys , and Janet Jackson .
In presidential elections , Montana was long classified as a swing state , though the state has voted for the Republican candidate in all but two elections from 1952 to the present . The state last supported a Democrat for president in 1992 , when Bill Clinton won a plurality victory . Overall , since 1889 the state has voted for Democratic governors 60 percent of the time and Democratic presidents 40 percent of the time , with these numbers being 40/60 for Republican candidates . In the 2008 presidential election , Montana was considered a swing state and was ultimately won by Republican John McCain , albeit by a narrow margin of two percent .
French infantry were equipped with the breech-loading Chassepot rifle , one of the most modern mass-produced firearms in the world at the time . With a rubber ring seal and a smaller bullet , the Chassepot had a maximum effective range of some 1,500 metres ( 4,900 ft ) with a short reloading time . French tactics emphasised the defensive use of the Chassepot rifle in trench-warfare style fighting—the so-called feu de bataillon . The artillery was equipped with rifled , muzzle-loaded La Hitte guns . The army also possessed a precursor to the machine-gun : the mitrailleuse , which could unleash significant , concentrated firepower but nevertheless lacked range and was comparatively immobile , and thus prone to being easily overrun . The mitrailleuse was mounted on an artillery gun carriage and grouped in batteries in a similar fashion to cannon .
The Mahayana sutras are a very broad genre of Buddhist scriptures that the Mahayana Buddhist tradition holds are original teachings of the Buddha . Some adherents of Mahayana accept both the early teachings ( including in this the Sarvastivada Abhidharma , which was criticized by Nagarjuna and is in fact opposed to early Buddhist thought ) and the Mahayana sutras as authentic teachings of Gautama Buddha , and claim they were designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual understanding .
After the grant of the royal charter it had become known as the Royal Institute of British Architects in London , eventually dropping the reference to London in 1892 . In 1934 , it moved to its current headquarters on Portland Place , with the building being opened by King George V and Queen Mary .
The earliest Greek philosophers , known as the pre-Socratics , provided competing answers to the question found in the myths of their neighbors : " How did the ordered cosmos in which we live come to be ? " The pre-Socratic philosopher Thales ( 640-546 BC ) , dubbed the " father of science " , was the first to postulate non-supernatural explanations for natural phenomena , for example , that land floats on water and that earthquakes are caused by the agitation of the water upon which the land floats , rather than the god Poseidon . Thales ' student Pythagoras of Samos founded the Pythagorean school , which investigated mathematics for its own sake , and was the first to postulate that the Earth is spherical in shape . Leucippus ( 5th century BC ) introduced atomism , the theory that all matter is made of indivisible , imperishable units called atoms . This was greatly expanded by his pupil Democritus .
Greece is a developed country with high standards of living [ citation needed ] and high Human Development Index . Its economy mainly comprises the service sector ( 85.0 % ) and industry ( 12.0 % ) , while agriculture makes up 3.0 % of the national economic output . Important Greek industries include tourism ( with 14.9 million international tourists in 2009 , it is ranked as the 7th most visited country in the European Union and 16th in the world by the United Nations World Tourism Organization ) and merchant shipping ( at 16.2 % of the world 's total capacity , the Greek merchant marine is the largest in the world ) , while the country is also a considerable agricultural producer ( including fisheries ) within the union .
Ethnocentrism , tribalism , religious persecution , and prebendalism have affected Nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960 . Kin-selective altruism has made its way into Nigerian politics , resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests . Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as MASSOB , Nationalist movements such as Oodua Peoples Congress , Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta and a civil war . Nigeria 's three largest ethnic groups ( Hausa , Igbo and Yoruba ) have maintained historical preeminence in Nigerian politics ; competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft .

About 150,000 East African and black people live in Israel , amounting to just over 2 % of the nation 's population . The vast majority of these , some 120,000 , are Beta Israel , most of whom are recent immigrants who came during the 1980s and 1990s from Ethiopia . In addition , Israel is home to over 5,000 members of the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem movement that are descendants of African Americans who emigrated to Israel in the 20th century , and who reside mainly in a distinct neighborhood in the Negev town of Dimona . Unknown numbers of black converts to Judaism reside in Israel , most of them converts from the United Kingdom , Canada , and the United States .
On 10 October , hostilities began between German and French republican forces near Orléans . At first , the Germans were victorious but the French drew reinforcements and defeated the Germans at the Battle of Coulmiers on 9 November . After the surrender of Metz , more than 100,000 well-trained and experienced German troops joined the German 'Southern Army ' . The French were forced to abandon Orléans on 4 December , and were finally defeated at the Battle of Le Mans ( 10–12 January ) . A second French army which operated north of Paris was turned back at the Battle of Amiens ( 27 November ) , the Battle of Bapaume ( 3 January 1871 ) and the Battle of St. Quentin ( 13 January ) .
Within computer systems , two of many security models capable of enforcing privilege separation are access control lists ( ACLs ) and capability-based security . Using ACLs to confine programs has been proven to be insecure in many situations , such as if the host computer can be tricked into indirectly allowing restricted file access , an issue known as the confused deputy problem . It has also been shown that the promise of ACLs of giving access to an object to only one person can never be guaranteed in practice . Both of these problems are resolved by capabilities . This does not mean practical flaws exist in all ACL-based systems , but only that the designers of certain utilities must take responsibility to ensure that they do not introduce flaws .

In March 2001 , 40 multi-national pharmaceutical companies brought litigation against South Africa for its Medicines Act , which allowed the generic production of antiretroviral drugs ( ARVs ) for treating HIV , despite the fact that these drugs were on-patent . HIV was and is an epidemic in South Africa , and ARVs at the time cost between 10,000 and 15,000 USD per patient per year . This was unaffordable for most South African citizens , and so the South African government committed to providing ARVs at prices closer to what people could afford . To do so , they would need to ignore the patents on drugs and produce generics within the country ( using a compulsory license ) , or import them from abroad . After international protest in favour of public health rights ( including the collection of 250,000 signatures by MSF ) , the governments of several developed countries ( including The Netherlands , Germany , France , and later the US ) backed the South African government , and the case was dropped in April of that year .
According to an autosomal DNA study by Hodgson et al . ( 2014 ) , the Afro-Asiatic languages were likely spread across Africa and the Near East by an ancestral population ( s ) carrying a newly identified non-African genetic component , which the researchers dub the " Ethio-Somali " . This Ethio-Somali component is today most common among Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa . It reaches a frequency peak among ethnic Somalis , representing the majority of their ancestry . The Ethio-Somali component is most closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component , and is believed to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago . On this basis , the researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population ( s ) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the Near East , having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the Sinai Peninsula . The population then likely split into two branches , with one group heading westward toward the Maghreb and the other moving south into the Horn .
Comics are a medium used to express ideas by images , often combined with text or other visual information . Comics frequently takes the form of juxtaposed sequences of panels of images . Often textual devices such as speech balloons , captions , and onomatopoeia indicate dialogue , narration , sound effects , or other information . Size and arrangement of panels contribute to narrative pacing . Cartooning and similar forms of illustration are the most common image-making means in comics ; fumetti is a form which uses photographic images . Common forms of comics include comic strips , editorial and gag cartoons , and comic books . Since the late 20th century , bound volumes such as graphic novels , comics albums , and tankōbon have become increasingly common , and online webcomics have proliferated in the 21st century .

Based on the strength of his work , Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films . The first was a Richard Matheson adaptation called Duel . The film is about a psychotic Peterbilt 281 tanker truck driver who chases the terrified driver ( Dennis Weaver ) of a small Plymouth Valiant and tries to run him off the road . Special praise of this film by the influential British critic Dilys Powell was highly significant to Spielberg 's career . Another TV film ( Something Evil ) was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of The Exorcist , then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film . He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film-length pilot of a show called Savage , starring Martin Landau . Spielberg 's debut full-length feature film was The Sugarland Express , about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby . Spielberg 's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers , and The Hollywood Reporter stated that " a major new director is on the horizon . " :223 However , the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release .
Washington University 's sports teams are called the Bears . They are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and participate in the University Athletic Association at the Division III level .

24th Street is in two parts . 24th Street starts at First Avenue and it ends at Madison Avenue , because of Madison Square Park . 25th Street , which is in three parts , starts at FDR Drive , is a pedestrian plaza between Third Avenue and Lexington Avenue , and ends at Madison . Then West 24th and 25th Streets continue from Fifth Avenue to Eleventh Avenue ( 25th ) or Twelfth Avenue ( 24th ) .
After Cao 's defeat at the naval Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 AD , China was divided into three spheres of influence , with Cao Cao dominating the north , Sun Quan ( 182–252 AD ) dominating the south , and Liu Bei ( 161–223 AD ) dominating the west . Cao Cao died in March 220 AD . By December his son Cao Pi ( 187–226 AD ) had Emperor Xian relinquish the throne to him and is known posthumously as Emperor Wen of Wei . This formally ended the Han dynasty and initiated an age of conflict between three states : Cao Wei , Eastern Wu , and Shu Han .
The earliest known chemical evidence of barley beer dates to circa 3500–3100 BC from the site of Godin Tepe in the Zagros Mountains of western Iran . Some of the earliest Sumerian writings contain references to beer ; examples include a prayer to the goddess Ninkasi , known as " The Hymn to Ninkasi " , which served as both a prayer as well as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people , and the ancient advice ( Fill your belly . Day and night make merry ) to Gilgamesh , recorded in the Epic of Gilgamesh , by the ale-wife Siduri may , at least in part , have referred to the consumption of beer . The Ebla tablets , discovered in 1974 in Ebla , Syria , show that beer was produced in the city in 2500 BC . A fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in China around 7000 BC . Unlike sake , mould was not used to saccharify the rice ( amylolytic fermentation ) ; the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting .
In Japan , 14 August is considered to be the day that the Pacific War ended . However , as Imperial Japan actually surrendered on 15 August , this day became known in the English-speaking countries as " V-J Day " ( Victory in Japan ) . The formal Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed on 2 September 1945 , on the battleship USS Missouri , in Tokyo Bay . The surrender was accepted by General Douglas MacArthur as Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers , with representatives of several Allied nations , from a Japanese delegation led by Mamoru Shigemitsu and Yoshijiro Umezu .
A Misratan militia took Gaddafi prisoner , beating him , causing serious injuries ; the events were filmed on a mobile phone . A video appears to picture Gaddafi being poked or stabbed in the rear end " with some kind of stick or knife " or possibly a bayonet . Pulled onto the front of a pick-up truck , he fell off as it drove away . His semi-naked , lifeless body was then placed into an ambulance and taken to Misrata ; upon arrival , he was found to be dead . Official NTC accounts claimed that Gaddafi was caught in a cross-fire and died from his bullet wounds . Other eye-witness accounts claimed that rebels had fatally shot Gaddafi in the stomach ; a rebel identifying himself as Senad el-Sadik el-Ureybi later claimed responsibility . Gaddafi 's son Mutassim , who had also been among the convoy , was also captured , and found dead several hours later , most probably from an extrajudicial execution . Around 140 Gaddafi loyalists were rounded up from the convoy ; tied up and abused , the corpses of 66 were found at the nearby Mahari Hotel , victims of extrajudicial execution . Libya 's chief forensic pathologist , Dr. Othman al-Zintani , carried out the autopsies of Gaddafi , his son and Jabr in the days following their deaths ; although the pathologist initially told the press that Gaddafi had died from a gunshot wound to the head , the autopsy report was not made public .
Under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin , the Bolsheviks established the Soviet state on 7 November [ O.S . 25 October ] 1917 , immediately after the Russian Provisional Government , which governed the Russian Republic , was overthrown during the October Revolution . Initially , the state did not have an official name and was n't recognized by neighboring countries for five months . Meanwhile , anti-Bolsheviks coined the mocking label " Sovdepia " for the nascent state of the " Soviets of Workers ' and Peasants ' Deputies " .
La Cueva De Las Ventanas ( The Cave of Windows ) , a series of cliff dwellings along an important trade route , and Las Jarillas Cave scrambled along the canyons of the Sierra Madre in Northwestern Chihuahua date between AD 1205 and 1260 and belong to the Paquimé culture . Cuarenta Casas is thought to have been a branch settlement from Paquime to protect the trade route from attack . Archaeologists believe the civilization began to decline during the 13th century and by the 15th century the inhabitants of Paquime sought refuge in the Sierra Madre Occidental while others are thought to have emigrated north and joined the Ancestral Pueblo peoples . According to anthropologist current natives tribes ( Yaqui , Mayo , Opata , and Tarahumara ) are descendants of the Casas Grandes culture .
The optimum format for a broadcast depends upon the type of videographic recording medium used and the image 's characteristics . For best fidelity to the source the transmitted field ratio , lines , and frame rate should match those of the source .
Madonna 's initial music videos reflected her American and Hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamor . She was able to transmit her avant-garde downtown New York fashion sense to the American audience . The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the True Blue era . Author Douglas Kellner noted , " such 'multiculturalism ' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences . " Madonna 's Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time , in the form of boleros and layered skirts , accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of " La Isla Bonita " .
The region grew based on the lucrative fur trade , in which numerous Native American people had important roles . Detroit 's city flag reflects its French colonial heritage . ( See Flag of Detroit ) . Descendants of the earliest French and French Canadian settlers formed a cohesive community who gradually were replaced as the dominant population after more Anglo-American settlers came to the area in the early 19th century . Living along the shores of Lakes St. Clair , and south to Monroe and downriver suburbs , the French Canadians of Detroit , also known as Muskrat French , remain a subculture in the region today .
Primark continued to investigate the allegations for three years , concluding that BBC report was a fake . In 2011 , following an investigation by the BBC Trust’s Editorial Standards Committee , the BBC announced , " Having carefully scrutinised all of the relevant evidence , the committee concluded that , on the balance of probabilities , it was more likely than not that the Bangalore footage was not authentic . " BBC subsequently apologised for faking footage , and returned the television award for investigative reporting .
P. Christiaan Klieger , an anthropologist and scholar of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco , writes that the vice royalty of the Sakya regime installed by the Mongols established a patron and priest relationship between Tibetans and Mongol converts to Tibetan Buddhism . According to him , the Tibetan lamas and Mongol khans upheld a " mutual role of religious prelate and secular patron , " respectively . He adds that " Although agreements were made between Tibetan leaders and Mongol khans , Ming and Qing emperors , it was the Republic of China and its Communist successors that assumed the former imperial tributaries and subject states as integral parts of the Chinese nation-state . "
During World War I , the palace , then the home of King George V and Queen Mary , escaped unscathed . Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in situ . The King imposed rationing at the palace , much to the dismay of his guests and household . To the King 's later regret , David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol , to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class . The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence . In 1938 , the north-west pavilion , designed by Nash as a conservatory , was converted into a swimming pool .
In reaction to the emergence of Reform Judaism , a group of traditionalist German Jews emerged in support of some of the values of the Haskalah , but also wanted to defend the classic , traditional interpretation of Jewish law and tradition . This group was led by those who opposed the establishment of a new temple in Hamburg , as reflected in the booklet " Ele Divrei HaBerit " . As a group of Reform Rabbis convened in Braunschweig , Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger of Altona published a manifesto entitled " Shlomei Emunei Yisrael " in German and Hebrew , having 177 Rabbis sign on . At this time the first Orthodox Jewish periodical , " Der Treue Zions Waechter " , was launched with the Hebrew supplement " Shomer Zion HaNe'eman " [ 1845 - 1855 ] . In later years it was Rav Ettlinger 's students Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch and Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer of Berlin who deepened the awareness and strength of Orthodox Jewry . Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch commented in 1854 :
South Indian music and dances such as the Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam styles are popular in the Deccan region . As a result of their culture policies , North Indian music and dance gained popularity during the rule of the Mughals and Nizams , and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with tawaif ( courtesans ) . These courtesans were revered as the epitome of etiquette and culture , and were appointed to teach singing , poetry and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy . This gave rise to certain styles of court music , dance and poetry . Besides western and Indian popular music genres such as filmi music , the residents of Hyderabad play city-based marfa music , dholak ke geet ( household songs based on local Folklore ) , and qawwali , especially at weddings , festivals and other celebratory events . The state government organises the Golconda Music and Dance Festival , the Taramati Music Festival and the Premavathi Dance Festival to further encourage the development of music .
Energy sources unsuitable for mobile power plants , such as nuclear power , renewable hydroelectricity , or wind power can be used . According to widely accepted global energy reserve statistics , the reserves of liquid fuel are much less than gas and coal ( at 42 , 167 and 416 years respectively ) . Most countries with large rail networks do not have significant oil reserves and those that did , like the United States and Britain , have exhausted much of their reserves and have suffered declining oil output for decades . Therefore , there is also a strong economic incentive to substitute other fuels for oil . Rail electrification is often considered an important route towards consumption pattern reform . However , there are no reliable , peer-reviewed studies available to assist in rational public debate on this critical issue , although there are untranslated Soviet studies from the 1980s .
Hunyadi succeeded during the Siege of Belgrade in 1456 against the Ottomans , the biggest victory against that empire in decades . This battle became a real Crusade against the Muslims , as the peasants were motivated by the Franciscan monk Saint John of Capistrano , who came from Italy predicating Holy War . The effect that it created in that time was one of the main factors that helped in achieving the victory . However the premature death of the Hungarian Lord left Pannonia defenseless and in chaos . In an extremely unusual event for the Middle Ages , Hunyadi 's son , Matthias , was elected as King of Hungary by the nobility . For the first time , a member of an aristocratic family ( and not from a royal family ) was crowned .
J. M. E. McTaggart of Cambridge University , argued that minds alone exist and only relate to each other through love . Space , time and material objects are unreal . In The Unreality of Time he argued that time is an illusion because it is impossible to produce a coherent account of a sequence of events . The Nature of Existence ( 1927 ) contained his arguments that space , time , and matter can not possibly be real . In his Studies in Hegelian Cosmology ( Cambridge , 1901 , p196 ) he declared that metaphysics are not relevant to social and political action . McTaggart " thought that Hegel was wrong in supposing that metaphysics could show that the state is more than a means to the good of the individuals who compose it " . For McTaggart " philosophy can give us very little , if any , guidance in action ... Why should a Hegelian citizen be surprised that his belief as to the organic nature of the Absolute does not help him in deciding how to vote ? Would a Hegelian engineer be reasonable in expecting that his belief that all matter is spirit should help him in planning a bridge ?
The illuminated ceiling was once popular in the 1960s and 1970s but fell out of favor after the 1980s . This uses diffuser panels hung like a suspended ceiling below fluorescent lights , and is considered general lighting . Other forms include neon , which is not usually intended to illuminate anything else , but to actually be an artwork in itself . This would probably fall under accent lighting , though in a dark nightclub it could be considered general lighting .
Furthermore , the amount of time adolescents spend on work and leisure activities varies greatly by culture as a result of cultural norms and expectations , as well as various socioeconomic factors . American teenagers spend less time in school or working and more time on leisure activities—which include playing sports , socializing , and caring for their appearance—than do adolescents in many other countries . These differences may be influenced by cultural values of education and the amount of responsibility adolescents are expected to assume in their family or community .
The University of Oklahoma has several institutions of higher learning in the city and metropolitan area , with OU Medicine and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center campuses located east of downtown in the Oklahoma Health Center district , and the main campus located to the south in the suburb of Norman . The OU Medicine hosting the state 's only Level-One trauma center . OU Health Sciences Center is one of the nation 's largest independent medical centers , employing more than 12,000 people . OU is one of only four major universities in the nation to operate six medical schools . [ clarification needed ]
Kevin Saunderson 's company KMS Records contributed many releases that were as much house music as they were techno . These tracks were well received in Chicago and played on Chicago radio and in clubs . [ citation needed ] Blake Baxter 's 1986 recording , " When we Used to Play / Work your Body " , 1987 's " Bounce Your Body to the Box " and " Force Field " , " The Sound / How to Play our Music " and " the Groove that Wo n't Stop " and a remix of " Grooving Without a Doubt " . In 1988 , as house music became more popular among general audiences , Kevin Saunderson 's group Inner City with Paris Gray released the 1988 hits " Big Fun " and " Good Life " , which eventually were picked up by Virgin Records . Each EP / 12 inch single sported remixes by Mike " Hitman " Wilson and Steve " Silk " Hurley of Chicago and Derrick " Mayday " May and Juan Atkins of Detroit . In 1989 , KMS had another hit release of " Rock to the Beat " which was a theme in Chicago dance clubs . [ citation needed ]
KU Endowment was established in 1891 as America’s first foundation for a public university . Its mission is to partner with donors in providing philanthropic support to build a greater University of Kansas .
The first record of the existence of a settlement at Plymouth was in the Domesday Book in 1086 as Sudtone , Saxon for south farm , located at the present day Barbican . From Saxon times , it was in the hundred of Roborough . In 1254 it gained status as a town and in 1439 , became the first town in England to be granted a Charter by Parliament . Between 1439 and 1934 , Plymouth had a Mayor . In 1914 the county boroughs of Plymouth and Devonport , and the urban district of East Stonehouse merged to form a single county borough of Plymouth . Collectively they were referred to as " The Three Towns " .
This idea was later developed in ancient philosophy by the Stoic school . Stoic epistemology generally emphasized that the mind starts blank , but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it . The doxographer Aetius summarizes this view as " When a man is born , the Stoics say , he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon . " Later stoics , such as Sextus of Chaeronea , would continue this idea of empiricism in later Stoic writings as well . As Sextus contends " For every thought comes from sense-perception or not without sense-perception and either from direct experience or not without direct experience " ( Against the Professors , 8.56-8 ) .
The first phase of neoclassicism in France is expressed in the " Louis XVI style " of architects like Ange-Jacques Gabriel ( Petit Trianon , 1762–68 ) ; the second phase , in the styles called Directoire and " Empire " , might be characterized by Jean Chalgrin 's severe astylar Arc de Triomphe ( designed in 1806 ) . In England the two phases might be characterized first by the structures of Robert Adam , the second by those of Sir John Soane . The interior style in France was initially a Parisian style , the " Goût grec " ( " Greek style " ) not a court style . Only when the young king acceded to the throne in 1771 did Marie Antoinette , his fashion-loving Queen , bring the " Louis XVI " style to court .
In 1578 , Elizabeth I granted a patent to Humphrey Gilbert for discovery and overseas exploration . That year , Gilbert sailed for the West Indies with the intention of engaging in piracy and establishing a colony in North America , but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic . In 1583 he embarked on a second attempt , on this occasion to the island of Newfoundland whose harbour he formally claimed for England , although no settlers were left behind . Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England , and was succeeded by his half-brother , Walter Raleigh , who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584 . Later that year , Raleigh founded the colony of Roanoke on the coast of present-day North Carolina , but lack of supplies caused the colony to fail .
Television transmissions resumed from Alexandra Palace in 1946 . The BBC Television Service ( renamed " BBC tv " in 1960 ) showed popular programming , including drama , comedies , documentaries , game shows , and soap operas , covering a wide range of genres and regularly competed with ITV to become the channel with the highest ratings for that week . The channel also introduced the science fiction show Doctor Who on 23 November 1963 - at 17:16 - which went on to become one of Britain 's most iconic and beloved television programmes .
The situation became so tense that war with the United States seemed imminent . On April 22 , 1914 , on the initiative of Felix A. Sommerfeld and Sherburne Hopkins , Pancho Villa traveled to Juárez to calm fears along the border and asked President Wilson 's emissary George Carothers to tell " Señor Wilson " that he had no problems with the American occupation of Veracruz . Carothers wrote to Secretary William Jennings Bryan : " As far as he was concerned we could keep Vera Cruz [ sic ] and hold it so tight that not even water could get in to Huerta and . . . he could not feel any resentment " . Whether trying to please the U.S. government or through the diplomatic efforts of Sommerfeld and Carothers , or maybe as a result of both , Villa stepped out from under Carranza’s stated foreign policy .
Higher education , also called tertiary , third stage , or postsecondary education , is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or secondary school . Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education , as well as vocational education and training . Colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education . Collectively , these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions . Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates , diplomas , or academic degrees .
Comcast operates multiple cable-only channels ( including E ! Entertainment Television , the Golf Channel , and NBCSN ) , over-the-air national broadcast network channels ( NBC and Telemundo ) , the film production studio Universal Pictures , and Universal Parks & Resorts , with a global total of nearly 200 family entertainment locations and attractions in the U.S. and several other countries including U.A.E. , South Korea , Russia and China , with several new locations reportedly planned and being developed for future operation . Comcast also has significant holding in digital distribution ( thePlatform ) . In February 2014 the company agreed to merge with Time Warner Cable in an equity swap deal worth $ 45.2 billion . Under the terms of the agreement Comcast was to acquire 100 % of Time Warner Cable . However , on April 24 , 2015 , Comcast terminated the agreement .
The name of the winning team is engraved on the silver band around the base as soon as the final has finished , in order to be ready in time for the presentation ceremony . This means the engraver has just five minutes to perform a task which would take twenty under normal conditions , although time is saved by engraving the year on during the match , and sketching the presumed winner . During the final , the trophy wears is decorated with ribbons in the colours of both finalists , with the loser 's ribbons being removed at the end of the game . Traditionally , at Wembley finals , the presentation is made at the Royal Box , with players , led by the captain , mounting a staircase to a gangway in front of the box and returning by a second staircase on the other side of the box . At Cardiff the presentation was made on a podium on the pitch .
In Presbyterian and Reformed churches , canon law is known as " practice and procedure " or " church order " , and includes the church 's laws respecting its government , discipline , legal practice and worship .
Under a banner of " reducing public drunkenness " the Beer Act of 1830 introduced a new lower tier of premises permitted to sell alcohol , the Beer Houses . At the time beer was viewed as harmless , nutritious and even healthy . Young children were often given what was described as small beer , which was brewed to have a low alcohol content , as the local water was often unsafe . Even the evangelical church and temperance movements of the day viewed the drinking of beer very much as a secondary evil and a normal accompaniment to a meal . The freely available beer was thus intended to wean the drinkers off the evils of gin , or so the thinking went .
The term samurai originally meant " those who serve in close attendance to nobility " , and was written with a Chinese character ( or kanji ) that had the same meaning . In Japanese , it was originally recorded in the Nara Period as a verb *samorapu ( " to watch , to keep watch , to observe , to be on the lookout for something ; to serve , to attend " ) , which is believed to be derived from the frequentative form ( *morapu 守らふ ) of the verb moru ( 守る , " to watch , to guard , to be on the lookout ; to keep , to protect , to take care of , to be in charge of , to have as one 's ward " ) . By the Heian period , this word had developed into the verb saburahu ( さぶらふ , " to serve , to attend " ) , from which a deverbal noun saburahi ( さぶらひ , " servant , attendant " ) was later derived , and this noun then yielded samurahi ( さむらひ ) in the Edo period . In Japanese literature , there is an early reference to samurai in the Kokinshū ( 古今集 , early 10th century ) :
While West had encountered controversy a year prior when he stormed out of the American Music Awards of 2004 after losing Best New Artist , the rapper 's first large-scale controversy came just days following Late Registration 's release , during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina victims . In September 2005 , NBC broadcast A Concert for Hurricane Relief , and West was a featured speaker . When West was presenting alongside actor Mike Myers , he deviated from the prepared script . Myers spoke next and continued to read the script . Once it was West 's turn to speak again , he said , " George Bush does n't care about black people . " West 's comment reached much of the United States , leading to mixed reactions ; President Bush would later call it one of the most " disgusting moments " of his presidency . West raised further controversy in January 2006 when he posed on the cover of Rolling Stone wearing a crown of thorns .
Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred in the reproduction of plants , thereby enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction . Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation . While other animals are included as pollinators , the majority of pollination is done by insects . Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism . The various flower traits ( and combinations thereof ) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes . These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations . Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations , including ultraviolet , and attractant pheromones . The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology .
Burmese resentment was strong and was vented in violent riots that paralysed Yangon ( Rangoon ) on occasion all the way until the 1930s . Some of the discontent was caused by a disrespect for Burmese culture and traditions such as the British refusal to remove shoes when they entered pagodas . Buddhist monks became the vanguards of the independence movement . U Wisara , an activist monk , died in prison after a 166-day hunger strike to protest against a rule that forbade him from wearing his Buddhist robes while imprisoned .
In the 1960 presidential election , Democratic candidate and future President John F. Kennedy " criticized President Eisenhower for not ending discrimination in federally supported housing " and " advocated a permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission " . :59 Shortly after taking office , Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925 in March 1961 , requiring government contractors to " consider and recommend additional affirmative steps which should be taken by executive departments and agencies to realize more fully the national policy of nondiscrimination… . The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed , and that employees are treated during employment , without regard to their race , creed , color , or national origin " . :60 The order also established the President 's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity ( PCEEO ) , chaired by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson . Federal contractors who failed to comply or violated the executive order were punished by contract cancellation and the possible debarment from future government contracts . The administration was " not demanding any special preference or treatment or quotas for minorities " but was rather " advocating racially neutral hiring to end job discrimination " . :61 Turning to issues of women 's rights , Kennedy initiated a Commission on the Status of Women in December 1961 . The commission was charged with " examining employment policies and practices of the government and of contractors " with regard to sex . :66
In late 2002 , the Internet Archive removed various sites that were critical of Scientology from the Wayback Machine . An error message stated that this was in response to a " request by the site owner . " Later , it was clarified that lawyers from the Church of Scientology had demanded the removal and that the site owners did not want their material removed .
Paper made from mechanical pulp contains significant amounts of lignin , a major component in wood . In the presence of light and oxygen , lignin reacts to give yellow materials , which is why newsprint and other mechanical paper yellows with age . Paper made from bleached kraft or sulfite pulps does not contain significant amounts of lignin and is therefore better suited for books , documents and other applications where whiteness of the paper is essential .
The undergraduates have a number of traditions : Painting The Rock ( originally a fountain donated by the Class of 1902 ) is a way to advertise , for example , campus organizations , events in Greek life , student groups , and university-wide events . Dance Marathon , a 30-hour philanthropic event , has raised more than 13 million dollars in its history for various children 's charities . Primal Scream is held at 9 p.m. on the Sunday before finals week every quarter ; students lean out of windows or gather in courtyards and scream . Armadillo Day , or , more popularly , Dillo Day , a day of music and food , is held on Northwestern 's Lakefill every Spring on the weekend after Memorial Day . And in one of the University 's newer traditions , every year during freshman orientation , known as Wildcat Welcome , freshmen and transfer students pass through Weber Arch to the loud huzzahs of upperclassmen and the music of the University Marching Band .
Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis , anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions . Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material , such as the Paleolithic and the Neolithic , of particular use in archaeology . [ citation needed ] Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types , such as Olduwan or Mousterian or Levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past . [ citation needed ] Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to Culture regions as well , since mapping cultures is central to both sciences . By making comparisons across cultural traditions ( time-based ) and cultural regions ( space-based ) , anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method , a central part of their science .
Consistent with the missions and priorities outlined above , the Canadian Armed Forces also contribute to the conduct of Canadian defence diplomacy through a range of activities , including the deployment of Canadian Defence Attachés , participation in bilateral and multilateral military forums ( e.g . the System of Cooperation Among the American Air Forces ) , ship and aircraft visits , military training and cooperation , and other such outreach and relationship-building efforts .
The most well-known hospital in the HHC system is Bellevue Hospital , the oldest public hospital in the United States . Bellevue is the designated hospital for treatment of the President of the United States and other world leaders if they become sick or injured while in New York City . The president of HHC is Ramanathan Raju , MD , a surgeon and former CEO of the Cook County health system in Illinois .
It was the pub that first introduced the concept of the bar counter being used to serve the beer . Until that time beer establishments used to bring the beer out to the table or benches , as remains the practice in ( for example ) beer gardens and other drinking establishments in Germany . A bar might be provided for the manager to do paperwork while keeping an eye on his or her customers , but the casks of ale were kept in a separate taproom . When the first pubs were built , the main room was the public room with a large serving bar copied from the gin houses , the idea being to serve the maximum number of people in the shortest possible time . It became known as the public bar [ citation needed ] . The other , more private , rooms had no serving bar—they had the beer brought to them from the public bar . There are a number of pubs in the Midlands or the North which still retain this set up but these days the beer is fetched by the customer from the taproom or public bar . One of these is The Vine , known locally as The Bull and Bladder , in Brierley Hill near Birmingham , another the Cock at Broom , Bedfordshire a series of small rooms served drinks and food by waiting staff . In the Manchester district the public bar was known as the " vault " , other rooms being the lounge and snug as usual elsewhere . By the early 1970s there was a tendency to change to one large drinking room and breweries were eager to invest in interior design and theming .
Ann Arbor is part of Michigan 's 12th congressional district , represented in Congress by Representative Debbie Dingell , a Democrat . On the state level , the city is part of the 18th district in the Michigan Senate , represented by Democrat Rebekah Warren . In the Michigan House of Representatives , representation is split between the 55th district ( northern Ann Arbor , part of Ann Arbor Township , and other surrounding areas , represented by Democrat Adam Zemke ) , the 53rd district ( most of downtown and the southern half of the city , represented by Democrat Jeff Irwin ) and the 52nd district ( southwestern areas outside Ann Arbor proper and western Washtenaw County , represented by Democrat Gretchen Driskell ) .
Due to the often political and cultural contours of blackness in the United States , the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people . Toni Morrison once described Bill Clinton as the first black President of the United States , because , as she put it , he displayed " almost every trope of blackness " . Christopher Hitchens was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president , noting , " Mr Clinton , according to Toni Morrison , the Nobel Prize-winning novelist , is our first black President , the first to come from the broken home , the alcoholic mother , the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems . Thus , we may have lost the mystical power to divine diabolism , but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms : broken homes , alcoholic mothers , under-the-bridge habits and ( presumable from the rest of [ Arthur ] Miller 's senescent musings ) the tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same . " Some black activists were also offended , claiming that Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain as no other president had before , while not serving black interests . They cite the lack of action during the Rwandan Genocide and his welfare reform , which Larry Roberts said had led to the worst child poverty since the 1960s . Others cited that the number of black people in jail increased during his administration .
Independent service is a special service mode found on most elevators . It is activated by a key switch either inside the elevator itself or on a centralized control panel in the lobby . When an elevator is placed on independent service , it will no longer respond to hall calls . ( In a bank of elevators , traffic is rerouted to the other elevators , while in a single elevator , the hall buttons are disabled ) . The elevator will remain parked on a floor with its doors open until a floor is selected and the door close button is held until the elevator starts to travel . Independent service is useful when transporting large goods or moving groups of people between certain floors .
In September 2014 , Professor Stefan Grimm , of the Department of Medicine , was found dead after being threatened with dismissal for failure to raise enough grant money . The College made its first public announcement of his death on 4 December 2014 . Grimm 's last email accused his employers of bullying by demanding that he should get grants worth at least £200,000 per year . His last email was viewed more than 100,000 times in the first four days after it was posted . The College has announced an internal inquiry into Stefan Grimm 's death . The inquest on his death has not yet reported .
Greece participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 35 times after its debut at the 1974 Contest . In 2005 , Greece won with the song " My Number One " , performed by Greek-Swedish singer Elena Paparizou . The song received 230 points with 10 sets of 12 points from Belgium , Bulgaria , Hungary , the United Kingdom , Turkey , Albania , Cyprus , Serbia & Montenegro , Sweden and Germany and also became a smash hit in different countries and especially in Greece . The 51st Eurovision Song Contest was held in Athens at the Olympic Indoor Hall of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Maroussi , with hosted by Maria Menounos and Sakis Rouvas .
West 's first six solo studio albums , all of which have gone platinum , have received numerous awards and critical acclaim . All of his albums have been commercially successful , with Yeezus , his sixth solo album , becoming his fifth consecutive No . 1 album in the U.S. upon release . West has had six songs exceed 3 million in digital sales as of December 2012 , with " Gold Digger " selling 3,086,000 , " Stronger " selling 4,402,000 , " Heartless " selling 3,742,000 , " E.T .

He has sold over 30 million digital songs in the United States making him one of the best-selling digital artists of all-time .
The Dean of the College of Cardinals , or Cardinal-dean , is the primus inter pares of the College of Cardinals , elected by the cardinal bishops holding suburbicarian sees from among their own number , an election , however , that must be approved by the Pope . Formerly the position of dean belonged by right to the longest-serving of the cardinal bishops .
The actual antenna which is transmitting the original wave then also may receive a strong signal from its own image from the ground . This will induce an additional current in the antenna element , changing the current at the feedpoint for a given feedpoint voltage . Thus the antenna 's impedance , given by the ratio of feedpoint voltage to current , is altered due to the antenna 's proximity to the ground . This can be quite a significant effect when the antenna is within a wavelength or two of the ground . But as the antenna height is increased , the reduced power of the reflected wave ( due to the inverse square law ) allows the antenna to approach its asymptotic feedpoint impedance given by theory . At lower heights , the effect on the antenna 's impedance is very sensitive to the exact distance from the ground , as this affects the phase of the reflected wave relative to the currents in the antenna . Changing the antenna 's height by a quarter wavelength , then changes the phase of the reflection by 180° , with a completely different effect on the antenna 's impedance .
The tour in March 1987 [ citation needed ] of Knuckles , Jefferson , Fingers Inc. ( Heard ) and Adonis as the DJ International Tour boosted house in the UK . Following the number-one success of MARRS ' " Pump Up The Volume " in October , the years 1987 to 1989 also saw UK acts such as The Beatmasters , Krush , Coldcut , Yazz , Bomb The Bass , S-Express , and Italy 's Black Box opening the doors to a house music onslaught on the UK charts . Early British house music quickly set itself apart from the original Chicago house sound ; [ citation needed ] many of the early hits were based on sample montage , rap was often used for vocals ( far more than in the US ) , [ citation needed ] and humor was frequently an important element .
Nanjing , with a total land area of 6,598 square kilometres ( 2,548 sq mi ) , is situated in the heartland of drainage area of lower reaches of Yangtze River , and in Yangtze River Delta , one of the largest economic zones of China . The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then north side of Nanjing City , while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north , east and south side of the city . The city is 300 kilometres ( 190 mi ) west-northwest of Shanghai , 1,200 kilometres ( 750 mi ) south-southeast of Beijing , and 1,400 kilometres ( 870 mi ) east-northeast of Chongqing . The downstream Yangtze River flows from Jiujiang , Jiangxi , through Anhui and Jiangsu to East Sea , north to drainage basin of downstream Yangtze is Huai River basin and south to it is Zhe River basin , and they are connected by the Grand Canal east to Nanjing . The area around Nanjing is called Hsiajiang ( 下江 , Downstream River ) region , with Jianghuai ( 江淮 ) stressing northern part and Jiangzhe ( 江浙 ) stressing southern part . The region is also known as Dongnan ( 東南 , South East , the Southeast ) and Jiangnan ( 江南 , River South , south of Yangtze ) .
During the Risorgimento , proponents of Italian republicanism and Italian nationalism , such as Alessandro Manzoni , stressed the importance of establishing a uniform national language in order to better create an Italian national identity . With the unification of Italy in the 1860s , standard Italian became the official national language of the new Italian state , while the various unofficial regional languages of Italy gradually became regarded as subordinate " dialects " to Italian , increasingly associated negatively with lack of education or provincialism . However , at the time of the Italian Unification , standard Italian still existed mainly as a literary language , and only 2.5 % of Italy 's population could speak standard Italian .
In 1817 the Saxon Palace was requisitioned by Warsaw 's Russian governor for military use , and the Warsaw Lyceum was reestablished in the Kazimierz Palace ( today the rectorate of Warsaw University ) . Fryderyk and his family moved to a building , which still survives , adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace . During this period , Fryderyk was sometimes invited to the Belweder Palace as playmate to the son of the ruler of Russian Poland , Grand Duke Constantine ; he played the piano for the Duke and composed a march for him . Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz , in his dramatic eclogue , " Nasze Przebiegi " ( " Our Discourses " , 1818 ) , attested to " little Chopin 's " popularity .
Since the late 18th century , Paris has been famous for its restaurants and haute cuisine , food meticulously prepared and artfully presented . A luxury restaurant , La Taverne Anglaise , opened in 1786 in the arcades of the Palais-Royal by Antoine Beauvilliers ; it featured an elegant dining room , an extensive menu , linen tablecloths , a large wine list and well-trained waiters ; it became a model for future Paris restaurants . The restaurant Le Grand Véfour in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period . The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century , including the Café de Paris , the Rocher de Cancale , the Café Anglais , Maison Dorée and the Café Riche , were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens ; they were immortalised in the novels of Balzac and Émile Zola . Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the Belle Epoque , including Maxim 's on Rue Royale , Ledoyen in the gardens of the Champs-Élysées , and the Tour d'Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle .
On July 6 , John Kerry selected John Edwards as his running mate , shortly before the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston , held later that month . Days before Kerry announced Edwards as his running mate , Kerry gave a short list of three candidates : Sen John Edwards , Rep Dick Gephardt , and Gov Tom Vilsack . Heading into the convention , the Kerry/Edwards ticket unveiled their new slogan—a promise to make America " stronger at home and more respected in the world . " Kerry made his Vietnam War experience the prominent theme of the convention . In accepting the nomination , he began his speech with , " I 'm John Kerry and I 'm reporting for duty . " He later delivered what may have been the speech 's most memorable line when he said , " the future does n't belong to fear , it belongs to freedom " , a quote that later appeared in a Kerry/Edwards television advertisement .
Some insects use parthenogenesis , a process in which the female can reproduce and give birth without having the eggs fertilized by a male . Many aphids undergo a form of parthenogenesis , called cyclical parthenogenesis , in which they alternate between one or many generations of asexual and sexual reproduction . In summer , aphids are generally female and parthenogenetic ; in the autumn , males may be produced for sexual reproduction . Other insects produced by parthenogenesis are bees , wasps and ants , in which they spawn males . However , overall , most individuals are female , which are produced by fertilization . The males are haploid and the females are diploid . More rarely , some insects display hermaphroditism , in which a given individual has both male and female reproductive organs .
In recent years significant quantities of offshore natural gas have been discovered in the area known as Aphrodite in Cyprus ' exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) , about 175 kilometres ( 109 miles ) south of Limassol at 33°5′40″N and 32°59′0″E . However , Turkey 's offshore drilling companies have accessed both natural gas and oil resources since 2013 . Cyprus demarcated its maritime border with Egypt in 2003 , and with Lebanon in 2007 . Cyprus and Israel demarcated their maritime border in 2010 , and in August 2011 , the US-based firm Noble Energy entered into a production-sharing agreement with the Cypriot government regarding the block 's commercial development .
The Kingdoms of England and Scotland were unified in 1707 creating the Kingdom of Great Britain . Following an attempted republican revolution in Ireland in 1798 , the Kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain were unified in 1801 , creating the United Kingdom . The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining outside of the United Kingdom but with their ultimate good governance being the responsibility of the British Crown ( effectively the British government ) . Although , the colonies of North American that would become the United States of America were lost by the start of the 19th century , the British Empire expanded rapidly elsewhere . A century later it would cover one third of the globe . Poverty in the United Kingdom remained desperate however and industrialisation in England led to terrible condition for the working class . Mass migrations following the Irish Famine and Highland Clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands ' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second-half of the 19th century . Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty ( 1919–1922 ) , with the six counties that formed Northern Ireland remaining as an autonomous region of the UK .
Diarrhea , also spelled diarrhoea , is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day . It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss . Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour . This can progress to decreased urination , loss of skin color , a fast heart rate , and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe . Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are breastfed , however , may be normal .
Like other historical languages , Old English has been used by scholars and enthusiasts of later periods to create texts either imitating Anglo-Saxon literature or deliberately transferring it to a different cultural context . Examples include Alistair Campbell and J. R. R. Tolkien . A number of websites devoted to Neo-Paganism and Historical re-enactment offer reference material and forums promoting the active use of Old English . By far the most ambitious project [ peacock term ] is the Old English Wikipedia , but most of the Neo-Old English texts published online bear little resemblance to the historical model and are riddled with very basic grammatical mistakes .
Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music , including both liturgical ( religious ) and secular music . While a similar term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 ( the Classical period ) , this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day , which includes the Classical period and various other periods . The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900 , which is known as the common practice period . The major time divisions of classical music are as follows : the early music period , which includes the Medieval ( 500–1400 ) and the Renaissance ( 1400–1600 ) eras ; the Common practice period , which includes the Baroque ( 1600–1750 ) , Classical ( 1750–1820 ) , and Romantic eras ( 1804–1910 ) ; and the 20th century ( 1901–2000 ) which includes the modern ( 1890–1930 ) that overlaps from the late 19th-century , the high modern ( mid 20th-century ) , and contemporary or postmodern ( 1975–2015 ) eras .

In February 1939 , he received news from his sisters that his mother was dying . On 10 February 1939 , Pope Pius XI died . Roncalli was unable to see his mother for the end as the death of a pontiff meant that he would have to stay at his post until the election of a new pontiff . Unfortunately , she died on 20 February 1939 , during the nine days of mourning for the late Pius XI . He was sent a letter by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli , and Roncalli later recalled that it was probably the last letter Pacelli sent until his election as Pope Pius XII on 2 March 1939 . Roncalli expressed happiness that Pacelli was elected , and , on radio , listened to the coronation of the new pontiff .
While the " footprint " of the Astra 2D satellite was smaller than that of Astra 2A , from which it was previously broadcast encrypted , it meant that viewers with appropriate equipment were able to receive BBC channels " free-to-air " over much of Western Europe . Consequently , some rights concerns have needed to be resolved with programme providers such as Hollywood studios and sporting organisations , which have expressed concern about the unencrypted signal leaking out . This led to some broadcasts being made unavailable on the Sky Digital platform , such as Scottish Premier League and Scottish Cup football , while on other platforms such broadcasts were not disrupted . Later , when rights contracts were renewed , this problem was resolved .
These were fighting words to be coming from a country that once insisted Europe needed Turkey and was willing to spill blood over it . For his authority Miller invokes the people , citing the " collective wisdom " of Europe , and introducing a concept to arise many times in the decades to follow under chilling circumstances :
Widespread segregation in 19th- and early 20th-century North America made it difficult for African-Americans to join Lodges outside of Prince Hall jurisdictions – and impossible for inter-jurisdiction recognition between the parallel U.S. Masonic authorities . By the 1980s , such discrimination was a thing of the past , and today most U.S. Grand Lodges recognise their Prince Hall counterparts , and the authorities of both traditions are working towards full recognition . The United Grand Lodge of England has no problem with recognising Prince Hall Grand Lodges . While celebrating their heritage as lodges of black Americans , Prince Hall is open to all men regardless of race or religion .
The economy of Tibet is dominated by subsistence agriculture , though tourism has become a growing industry in recent decades . The dominant religion in Tibet is Tibetan Buddhism ; in addition there is Bön , which is similar to Tibetan Buddhism , and there are also Tibetan Muslims and Christian minorities . Tibetan Buddhism is a primary influence on the art , music , and festivals of the region . Tibetan architecture reflects Chinese and Indian influences . Staple foods in Tibet are roasted barley , yak meat , and butter tea .
Developed countries have people with more resources ( housing , food , transportation , water and sewage treatment , hospitals , health care , libraries , books , media , schools , the internet , education , etc . ) than most of the world 's population . One merely needs to see through travel or the media how many people in the undeveloped countries live to sense this . However , one can also use economic data to gain some insight into this . Yet criticism and blame are common among people in the developed countries .
The exonym Armenia is attested in the Old Persian Behistun Inscription ( 515 BC ) as Armina ( ) . The ancient Greek terms Ἀρμενία ( Armenía ) and Ἀρμένιοι ( Arménioi , " Armenians " ) are first mentioned by Hecataeus of Miletus ( c. 550 BC – c. 476 BC ) . Xenophon , a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions , describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC . He relates that the people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians . According to the histories of both Moses of Chorene and Michael Chamchian , Armenia derives from the name of Aram , a lineal descendant of Hayk .
As " runways at sea " , aircraft carriers have a flat-top flight deck , which launches and recovers aircraft . Aircraft launch forward , into the wind , and are recovered from astern . The flight deck is where the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found . Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier – for example , the fact that it is a ship means that a full-length runway would be costly to construct and maintain . This affects take-off procedure , as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft accelerate more quickly to gain lift . This either requires a thrust boost , a vertical component to its velocity , or a reduced take-off load ( to lower mass ) . The differing types of deck configuration , as above , influence the structure of the flight deck . The form of launch assistance a carrier provides is strongly related to the types of aircraft embarked and the design of the carrier itself .
Internationally , in 1920 , the RSFSR was recognized as an independent state only by Estonia , Finland , Latvia and Lithuania in the Treaty of Tartu and by the short-lived Irish Republic .
A CD is read by focusing a 780 nm wavelength ( near infrared ) semiconductor laser housed within the CD player , through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer . The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected . By measuring the intensity change with a photodiode , the data can be read from the disc . In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data , the semiconductor laser is placed on a swing arm within the disc tray of any CD player . This swing arm allows the laser to read information from the centre to the edge of a disc , without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself .
When people define and talk about a particular conception of race , they create a social reality through which social categorization is achieved . In this sense , races are said to be social constructs . These constructs develop within various legal , economic , and sociopolitical contexts , and may be the effect , rather than the cause , of major social situations . While race is understood to be a social construct by many , most scholars agree that race has real material effects in the lives of people through institutionalized practices of preference and discrimination .
Prior to Planck 's work , it had been assumed that the energy of a body could take on any value whatsoever – that it was a continuous variable . The Rayleigh–Jeans law makes close predictions for a narrow range of values at one limit of temperatures , but the results diverge more and more strongly as temperatures increase . To make Planck 's law , which correctly predicts blackbody emissions , it was necessary to multiply the classical expression by a complex factor that involves h in both the numerator and the denominator . The influence of h in this complex factor would not disappear if it were set to zero or to any other value . Making an equation out of Planck 's law that would reproduce the Rayleigh–Jeans law could not be done by changing the values of h , of the Boltzmann constant , or of any other constant or variable in the equation . In this case the picture given by classical physics is not duplicated by a range of results in the quantum picture .
In October 1997 , Nintendo released a redesigned model of the SNES ( the SNS-101 model ) in North America for US $ 99 , which sometimes included the pack-in game Super Mario World 2 : Yoshi 's Island . Like the earlier redesign of the NES ( the NES-101 model ) , the new model was slimmer and lighter than its predecessor , but it lacked S-Video and RGB output , and it was among the last major SNES-related releases in the region . A similarly redesigned Super Famicom Jr. was released in Japan at around the same time .
One rescue team reported only 2,300 survivors from the town of Yingxiu in Wenchuan County , out of a total population of about 9,000 . 3,000 to 5,000 people were killed in Beichuan County , Sichuan alone ; in the same location , 10,000 people were injured and 80 % of the buildings were destroyed . The old county seat of Beichuan was abandoned and preserved as part of the Beichuan Earthquake Museum . Eight schools were toppled in Dujiangyan . A 56-year-old was killed in Dujiangyan during a rescue attempt on the Lingyanshan Ropeway , where due to the earthquake 11 tourists from Taiwan had been trapped inside cable cars since May 13 . A 4-year-old boy named Zhu Shaowei ( traditional Chinese : 朱紹維 ; simplified Chinese : 朱绍维 ; pinyin : Zhū Shàowéi ) was also killed in Mianzhu City when a house collapsed on him and another was reported missing .
Brigham Young University is a part of the Church Educational System of LDS Church . It is organized under a Board of Trustees , with the President of the Church ( currently Thomas S. Monson ) as chairman . This board consists of the same people as the Church Board of Education , a pattern that has been in place since 1939 . Prior to 1939 , BYU had a separate board of trustees that was subordinate to the Church Board of Education . The President of BYU , currently Kevin J Worthen , reports to the Board , through the Commissioner of Education .
The Sumerian city-states rose to power during the prehistoric Ubaid and Uruk periods . Sumerian written history reaches back to the 27th century BC and before , but the historical record remains obscure until the Early Dynastic III period , c. the 23rd century BC , when a now deciphered syllabary writing system was developed , which has allowed archaeologists to read contemporary records and inscriptions . Classical Sumer ends with the rise of the Akkadian Empire in the 23rd century BC . Following the Gutian period , there is a brief Sumerian Renaissance in the 21st century BC , cut short in the 20th century BC by Semitic Amorite invasions . The Amorite " dynasty of Isin " persisted until c. 1700 BC , when Mesopotamia was united under Babylonian rule . The Sumerians were eventually absorbed into the Akkadian ( Assyro-Babylonian ) population .
On October 2 , 1997 , it was reported that Khrushchev 's son Sergei claimed Khrushchev was poised to accept Kennedy 's proposal at the time of Kennedy 's assassination on November 22 , 1963 . During the next few weeks he reportedly concluded that both nations might realize cost benefits and technological gains from a joint venture , and decided to accept Kennedy 's offer based on a measure of rapport during their years as leaders of the world 's two superpowers , but changed his mind and dropped the idea since he did not have the same trust for Kennedy 's successor , Lyndon Johnson .
The English word scientist is relatively recent—first coined by William Whewell in the 19th century . Previously , people investigating nature called themselves natural philosophers . While empirical investigations of the natural world have been described since classical antiquity ( for example , by Thales , Aristotle , and others ) , and scientific methods have been employed since the Middle Ages ( for example , by Ibn al-Haytham , and Roger Bacon ) , the dawn of modern science is often traced back to the early modern period and in particular to the scientific revolution that took place in 16th- and 17th-century Europe . Scientific methods are considered to be so fundamental to modern science that some consider earlier inquiries into nature to be pre-scientific . Traditionally , historians of science have defined science sufficiently broadly to include those inquiries .
The Gregorian calendar was a reform of the Julian calendar instituted in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII , after whom the calendar was named , by papal bull Inter gravissimas dated 24 February 1582 . The motivation for the adjustment was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter to the time of year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church . Although a recommendation of the First Council of Nicaea in 325 specified that all Christians should celebrate Easter on the same day , it took almost five centuries before virtually all Christians achieved that objective by adopting the rules of the Church of Alexandria ( see Easter for the issues which arose ) .
Treatment of TB uses antibiotics to kill the bacteria . Effective TB treatment is difficult , due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall , which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective . The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin , and treatments can be prolonged , taking several months . Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic , while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance . People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life . Directly observed therapy , i.e. , having a health care provider watch the person take their medications , is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics . The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is poor . Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment do , however , appear effective .

Red played an important role in Chinese philosophy . It was believed that the world was composed of five elements : metal , wood , water , fire and earth , and that each had a color . Red was associated with fire . Each Emperor chose the color that his fortune-tellers believed would bring the most prosperity and good fortune to his reign . During the Zhou , Han , Jin , Song and Ming Dynasties , red considered a noble color , and it was featured in all court ceremonies , from coronations to sacrificial offerings , and weddings .
Japan saw the release of the Satellaview , a modem which attached to the Super Famicom 's expansion port and connected to the St.GIGA satellite radio station . Users of the Satellaview could download gaming news and specially designed games , which were frequently either remakes of or sequels to older Famicom titles , released in installments . Satellaview signals were broadcast from April 23 , 1995 through June 30 , 2000 . In the United States , the similar but relatively short-lived XBAND allowed users to connect to a network via a dial-up modem to compete against other players around the country .
However , this was not always the case ; in the early 20th century , once it became apparent that the " sport " was worked , pro wrestling was looked down on as a cheap entertainment for the uneducated working class — an attitude that still exists to varying degrees today . The French theorist Roland Barthes was among the first to propose that wrestling was worthy of deeper analysis , in his essay " The World of Wrestling " from his book Mythologies , first published in 1957 . Barthes argued that it should be looked at not as a scamming of the ignorant , but as spectacle ; a mode of theatric performance for a willing , if bloodthirsty , audience . Wrestling is described as performed art which demands an immediate reading of the juxtaposed meanings . The logical conclusion is given least importance over the theatrical performers of the wrestlers and the referee . According to Barthes , the function of a wrestler is not to win : it is to go exactly through the motions which are expected of them and to give the audience a theatrical spectacle . This work is considered a foundation of all later study .
The UK political system , while technically a multi-party system , has functioned generally as a two-party ( sometimes called a " two-and-a-half party " ) system ; since the 1920s the two largest political parties have been the Conservative Party and the Labour Party . Before the Labour Party rose in British politics the Liberal Party was the other major political party along with the Conservatives . Though coalition and minority governments have been an occasional feature of parliamentary politics , the first-past-the-post electoral system used for general elections tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties , though each has in the past century relied upon a third party to deliver a working majority in Parliament . ( A plurality voting system usually leads to a two-party system , a relationship described by Maurice Duverger and known as Duverger 's Law . ) There are also numerous other parties that hold or have held a number of seats in Parliament .
The Grito de Dolores ( " Cry of Dolores " ) also known as El Grito de la Independencia ( " Cry of Independence " ) , uttered from the small town of Dolores near Guanajuato on September 16 , 1810 , is the event that marks the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence and is the most important national holiday observed in Mexico . The " Grito " was the battle cry of the Mexican War of Independence by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla , a Roman Catholic priest . Hidalgo and several criollos were involved in a planned revolt against the Spanish colonial government , and the plotters were betrayed . Fearing his arrest , Hidalgo commanded his brother Mauricio as well as Ignacio Allende and Mariano Abasolo to go with a number of other armed men to make the sheriff release the pro-independence inmates there on the night of September 15 . They managed to set eighty free . Around 6:00 am September 16 , 1810 , Hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung and gathered his congregation . Flanked by Allende and Juan Aldama , he addressed the people in front of his church , encouraging them to revolt . The Battle of Guanajuato , the first major engagement of the insurgency , occurred four days later . Mexico 's independence from Spain was effectively declared in the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire on September 27 , 1821 , after a decade of war . Unrest followed for the next several decades , as different factions fought for control of Mexico .
Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas comprise a major category in the world art collection . Contributions include pottery , paintings , jewellery , weavings , sculptures , basketry , carvings , and beadwork . Because too many artists were posing as Native Americans and Alaska Natives in order to profit from the caché of Indigenous art in the United States , the U.S. passed the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 , requiring artists to prove that they are enrolled in a state or federally recognized tribe . To support the ongoing practice of American Indian , Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian arts and cultures in the United States , the Ford Foundation , arts advocates and American Indian tribes created an endowment seed fund and established a national Native Arts and Cultures Foundation in 2007 .
Charleston annually hosts Spoleto Festival USA founded by Gian Carlo Menotti , a 17-day art festival featuring over 100 performances by individual artists in a variety of disciplines . The Spoleto Festival is internationally recognized as America 's premier performing arts festival . The annual Piccolo Spoleto festival takes place at the same time and features local performers and artists , with hundreds of performances throughout the city . Other festivals and events include Historic Charleston Foundation 's Festival of Houses and Gardens and Charleston Antiques Show , the Taste of Charleston , The Lowcountry Oyster Festival , the Cooper River Bridge Run , The Charleston Marathon , Southeastern Wildlife Exposition ( SEWE ) , Charleston Food and Wine Festival , Charleston Fashion Week , the MOJA Arts Festival , and the Holiday Festival of Lights ( at James Island County Park ) , and the Charleston International Film Festival .
Under modern constitutional conventions , the sovereign acts on the advice of his or her ministers . Since these ministers most often maintain the support of parliament and are the ones who obtain the passage of bills , it is highly improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent . An exception is sometimes stated to be if bills are not passed in good faith , though it is difficult to make an interpretation on what this circumstance might constitute . Hence , in modern practice , royal assent is always granted ; a refusal to do so would be appropriate only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch 's reserve powers .
On 7 June 1950 , Kim Il-sung called for a Korea-wide election on 5–8 August 1950 and a consultative conference in Haeju on 15–17 June 1950 . On 11 June , the North sent three diplomats to the South , as a peace overture that Rhee rejected . On 21 June , Kim Il-Sung revised his war plan to involve general attack across the 38th parallel , rather than a limited operation in the Ongjin peninsula . Kim was concerned that South Korean agents had learned about the plans and South Korean forces were strengthening their defenses . Stalin agreed to this change of plan .
From the late 10th to late 7th centuries BC , the Iranian peoples , together with the pre-Iranian kingdoms , fell under the domination of the Assyrian Empire , based in northern Mesopotamia . Under king Cyaxares , the Medes and Persians entered into an alliance with Nabopolassar of Babylon , as well as the Scythians and the Cimmerians , and together they attacked the Assyrian Empire . The civil war ravaged the Assyrian Empire between 616 BC and 605 BC , thus freeing their respective peoples from three centuries of Assyrian rule . The unification of the Median tribes under a single ruler in 728 BC led to the foundation of the Median Empire which , by 612 BC , controlled the whole Iran and the eastern Anatolia . This marked the end of the Kingdom of Urartu as well , which was subsequently conquered and dissolved .
Pascal Boyer argues that while there is a wide array of supernatural concepts found around the world , in general , supernatural beings tend to behave much like people . The construction of gods and spirits like persons is one of the best known traits of religion . He cites examples from Greek mythology , which is , in his opinion , more like a modern soap opera than other religious systems . Bertrand du Castel and Timothy Jurgensen demonstrate through formalization that Boyer 's explanatory model matches physics ' epistemology in positing not directly observable entities as intermediaries . Anthropologist Stewart Guthrie contends that people project human features onto non-human aspects of the world because it makes those aspects more familiar . Sigmund Freud also suggested that god concepts are projections of one 's father .
Asphalt/bitumen is similar to the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites . However , detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct . The vast Alberta bitumen resources are believed to have started out as living material from marine plants and animals , mainly algae , that died millions of years ago when an ancient ocean covered Alberta . They were covered by mud , buried deeply over the eons , and gently cooked into oil by geothermal heat at a temperature of 50 to 150 °C ( 120 to 300 °F ) . Due to pressure from the rising of the Rocky Mountains in southwestern Alberta , 80 to 55 million years ago , the oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres into underground sand deposits left behind by ancient river beds and ocean beaches , thus forming the oil sands .
Another class of knights were granted land by the prince , allowing them the economic ability to serve the prince militarily . A Polish nobleman living at the time prior to the 15th century was referred to as a " rycerz " , very roughly equivalent to the English " knight , " the critical difference being the status of " rycerz " was almost strictly hereditary ; the class of all such individuals was known as the " rycerstwo " . Representing the wealthier families of Poland and itinerant knights from abroad seeking their fortunes , this other class of rycerstwo , which became the szlachta/nobility ( " szlachta " becomes the proper term for Polish nobility beginning about the 15th century ) , gradually formed apart from Mieszko I 's and his successors ' elite retinues . This rycerstwo/nobility obtained more privileges granting them favored status . They were absolved from particular burdens and obligations under ducal law , resulting in the belief only rycerstwo ( those combining military prowess with high/noble birth ) could serve as officials in state administration .
More recently , scientists have started to focus on measuring changes in brain activity related to sexual arousal , by using brain-scanning techniques . A study on how heterosexual and homosexual men 's brains react to seeing pictures of naked men and women has found that both hetero- and homosexual men react positively to seeing their preferred sex , using the same brain regions . The only significant group difference between these orientations was found in the amygdala , a brain region known to be involved in regulating fear .
The island has two local newspapers , both of which are available on the Internet . The St Helena Independent has been published since November 2005 . The Sentinel newspaper was introduced in 2012 .
Standard Dutch uses three genders to differentiate between natural gender and three when discerning grammatical gender . But for most non-Belgian speakers , the masculine and feminine genders have merged to form the common gender ( de ) , while the neuter ( het ) remains distinct as before . This gender system is similar to those of most Continental Scandinavian languages . As in English , but to a lesser degree , the inflectional grammar of the language ( e.g. , adjective and noun endings ) has simplified over time .
Muammar Gaddafi was born in a tent near Qasr Abu Hadi , a rural area outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of western Libya . His family came from a small , relatively un-influential tribal group called the Qadhadhfa , who were Arabized Berber in heritage . His father , Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad , was known as Abu Meniar ( died 1985 ) , and his mother was named Aisha ( died 1978 ) ; Abu Meniar earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder . Nomadic Bedouins , they were illiterate and kept no birth records . As such , Gaddafi 's date of birth is not known with certainty , and sources have set it in 1942 or in the spring of 1943 , although biographers Blundy and Lycett noted that it could have been pre-1940 . His parents ' only surviving son , he had three older sisters . Gaddafi 's upbringing in Bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life . He repeatedly expressed a preference for the desert over the city and retreated to the desert to meditate .
Genetic studies on Ashkenazim have been conducted to determine how much of their ancestry comes from the Levant , and how much derives from European populations . These studies—researching both their paternal and maternal lineages—point to a significant prevalence of ancient Levantine origins . But they have arrived at diverging conclusions regarding both the degree and the sources of their European ancestry . These diverging conclusions focus particularly on the extent of the European genetic origin observed in Ashkenazi maternal lineages .
Batteries are usually grouped into battalions or equivalent . In the field army a light gun or SHORAD battalion is often assigned to a manoeuvre division . Heavier guns and long-range missiles may be in air-defence brigades and come under corps or higher command . Homeland air defence may have a full military structure . For example , the UK 's Anti-Aircraft Command , commanded by a full British Army general was part of ADGB . At its peak in 1941–42 it comprised three AA corps with 12 AA divisions between them .
At the end of the Balkan Wars , the extent of Greece 's territory and population had increased . In the following years , the struggle between King Constantine I and charismatic Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos over the country 's foreign policy on the eve of World War I dominated the country 's political scene , and divided the country into two opposing groups . During parts of the First World War , Greece had two governments ; a royalist pro-German government in Athens and a Venizelist pro-Britain one in Thessaloniki . The two governments were united in 1917 , when Greece officially entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente .
Most of the postwar 's presidents of the Fifth Republic wanted to leave their own monuments in Paris ; President Georges Pompidou started the Centre Georges Pompidou ( 1977 ) , Valéry Giscard d'Estaing began the Musée d'Orsay ( 1986 ) ; President François Mitterrand , in power for 14 years , built the Opéra Bastille ( 1985-1989 ) , the Bibliothèque nationale de France ( 1996 ) , the Arche de la Défense ( 1985-1989 ) , and the Louvre Pyramid with its underground courtyard ( 1983-1989 ) ; Jacques Chirac ( 2006 ) , the Musée du quai Branly .
The French cleric Pierre Gassendi ( 1592-1665 ) represented the materialist tradition in opposition to the attempts of René Descartes ( 1596-1650 ) to provide the natural sciences with dualist foundations . There followed the materialist and atheist abbé Jean Meslier ( 1664-1729 ) , Julien Offray de La Mettrie , the German-French Paul-Henri Thiry Baron d'Holbach ( 1723-1789 ) , the Encyclopedist Denis Diderot ( 1713-1784 ) , and other French Enlightenment thinkers ; as well as ( in England ) John " Walking " Stewart ( 1747-1822 ) , whose insistence in seeing matter as endowed with a moral dimension had a major impact on the philosophical poetry of William Wordsworth ( 1770-1850 ) .
The book was never published . Instead the Normans whirled off to New York . Norman published the gist of his planned travel book curiously mixed with vituperation against the Ottoman Empire in an article in June , 1896 , in Scribner 's Magazine . The empire had descended from an enlightened civilization ruling over barbarians for their own good to something considerably less . The difference was the Hamidian Massacres , which were being conducted even as the couple traveled the Balkans . According to Norman now , the empire had been established by " the Moslem horde " from Asia , which was stopped by " intrepid Hungary . " Furthermore , " Greece shook off the turbaned destroyer of her people " and so on . The Russians were suddenly liberators of oppressed Balkan states . Having portrayed the Armenians as revolutionaries in the name of freedom with the expectation of being rescued by the intervention of Christian Europe , he states " but her hope was vain . " England had " turned her back . " Norman concluded his exhortation with " In the Balkans one learns to hate the Turk . " Norman made sure that Gladstone read the article . Prince Nicolas of Montenegro wrote a letter thanking him for his article .
An investigation by ProPublica found that at least 21 doctors have been paid more than $ 500,000 for speeches and consulting by drugs manufacturers since 2009 , with half of the top earners working in psychiatry , and about $ 2 billion in total paid to doctors for such services . AstraZeneca , Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly have paid billions of dollars in federal settlements over allegations that they paid doctors to promote drugs for unapproved uses . Some prominent medical schools have since tightened rules on faculty acceptance of such payments by drug companies .
In Georgia Russian has no official status , but it 's recognised as a minority language under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities . According to estimates from Demoskop Weekly , in 2004 there were 130,000 native speakers of Russian in the country , and 1.7 million active speakers . 27 % of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006 , and 1 % used it as the main language with family , friends or at work . Russian is the language of 9 % of the population according to the World Factook . Ethnologue cites Russian as the country 's de facto working language .
A combination of urban and suburban development , the West Side is generally defined as the area west of I-10 . Western Tucson encompasses the banks of the Santa Cruz River and the foothills of the Tucson Mountains , and includes the International Wildlife Museum , Sentinel Peak , and the Marriott Starr Pass Resort & Spa , located in the wealthy enclave known as Starr Pass . Moving past the Tucson Mountains , travelers find themselves in the area commonly referred to as " west of " Tucson or " Old West Tucson " . A large undulating plain extending south into the Altar Valley , rural residential development predominates , but here you will also find major attractions including Saguaro National Park West , the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum , and the Old Tucson Studios movie set/theme park .
New claims on Antarctica have been suspended since 1959 although Norway in 2015 formally defined Queen Maud Land as including the unclaimed area between it and the South Pole . Antarctica 's status is regulated by the 1959 Antarctic Treaty and other related agreements , collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System . Antarctica is defined as all land and ice shelves south of 60° S for the purposes of the Treaty System . The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the Soviet Union ( and later Russia ) , the United Kingdom , Argentina , Chile , Australia , and the United States . It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve , established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection , and banned military activity on Antarctica . This was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War .
The members of The Beatles were made MBEs in 1965 . John Lennon justified the comparative merits of his investiture by comparing military membership in the Order : " Lots of people who complained about us receiving the MBE [ status ] received theirs for heroism in the war – for killing people… We received ours for entertaining other people . I 'd say we deserve ours more . " Lennon later returned his MBE insignia on 25 November 1969 as part of his ongoing peace protests . Other criticism centres on the claim that many recipients of the Order are being rewarded with honours for simply doing their jobs ; critics claim that the civil service and judiciary receive far more orders and honours than leaders of other professions .
With the new stadium , Barcelona participated in the inaugural version of the Pyrenees Cup , which , at the time , consisted of the best teams of Languedoc , Midi and Aquitaine ( Southern France ) , the Basque Country and Catalonia ; all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region . The contest was the most prestigious in that era . From the inaugural year in 1910 to 1913 , Barcelona won the competition four consecutive times . Carles Comamala played an integral part of the four-time champion , managing the side along with Amechazurra and Jack Greenwell . The latter became the club 's first full-time coach in 1917 . The last edition was held in 1914 in the city of Barcelona , which local rivals Espanyol won .
Despite the commanded withdrawal of Egyptian troops , about 2,000 Egyptian soldiers were killed during engagement with Israeli forces , and some 5,000 Egyptian soldiers were captured by the Israeli Army . Amer and Salah Salem proposed requesting a ceasefire , with Salem further recommending that Nasser surrender himself to British forces . Nasser berated Amer and Salem , and vowed , " Nobody is going to surrender . " Nasser assumed military command . Despite the relative ease in which Sinai was occupied , Nasser 's prestige at home and among Arabs was undamaged . To counterbalance the Egyptian Army 's dismal performance , Nasser authorized the distribution of about 400,000 rifles to civilian volunteers and hundreds of militias were formed throughout Egypt , many led by Nasser 's political opponents .
The city was incorporated in 1854 , the same year in which the Camden and Atlantic Railroad train service began . Built on the edge of the bay , this served as the direct link of this remote parcel of land with Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . That same year , construction of the Absecon Lighthouse , designed by George Meade of the Corps of Topographical Engineers , was approved , with work initiated the next year . By 1874 , almost 500,000 passengers a year were coming to Atlantic City by rail . In Boardwalk Empire : The Birth , High Times , and Corruption of Atlantic City , " Atlantic City 's Godfather " Nelson Johnson describes the inspiration of Dr. Jonathan Pitney ( the " Father of Atlantic City " ) to develop Atlantic City as a health resort , his efforts to convince the municipal authorities that a railroad to the beach would be beneficial , his successful alliance with Samuel Richards ( entrepreneur and member of the most influential family in southern New Jersey at the time ) to achieve that goal , the actual building of the railroad , and the experience of the first 600 riders , who " were chosen carefully by Samuel Richards and Jonathan Pitney " :
Machine vision systems often require bright and homogeneous illumination , so features of interest are easier to process . LEDs are often used for this purpose , and this is likely to remain one of their major uses until the price drops low enough to make signaling and illumination uses more widespread . Barcode scanners are the most common example of machine vision , and many low cost products use red LEDs instead of lasers . Optical computer mice are an example of LEDs in machine vision , as it is used to provide an even light source on the surface for the miniature camera within the mouse . LEDs constitute a nearly ideal light source for machine vision systems for several reasons :
The Portuguese explorer Diogo Cão reached the mouth of the Congo in 1484 . Commercial relationships quickly grew between the inland Bantu kingdoms and European merchants who traded various commodities , manufactured goods , and people captured from the hinterlands . After centuries as a major hub for transatlantic trade , direct European colonization of the Congo river delta began in the late 19th century , subsequently eroding the power of the Bantu societies in the region .
Due to the centralisation of power and the Viking invasions , there is relatively little written record of the non-Wessex dialects after Alfred 's unification . Some Mercian texts continued to be written , however , and the influence of Mercian is apparent in some of the translations produced under Alfred 's programme , many of which were produced by Mercian scholars . Other dialects certainly continued to be spoken , as is evidenced by the continued variation between their successors in Middle and Modern English . In fact , what would become the standard forms of Middle English and of Modern English are descended from Mercian rather than West Saxon , while Scots developed from the Northumbrian dialect . It was once claimed that , owing to its position at the heart of the Kingdom of Wessex , the relics of Anglo-Saxon accent , idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the dialect of Somerset .
On 21 December 1941 , the Partisans created the First Proletarian Brigade ( commanded by Koča Popović ) and on 1 March 1942 , Tito created the Second Proletarian Brigade . In liberated territories , the Partisans organised People 's Committees to act as civilian government . The Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia ( AVNOJ ) convened in Bihać on 26–27 November 1942 and in Jajce on 29 November 1943 . In the two sessions , the resistance representatives established the basis for post-war organisation of the country , deciding on a federation of the Yugoslav nations . In Jajce , a 67-member " presidency " was elected and established a nine-member National Committee of Liberation ( five communist members ) as a de facto provisional government . Tito was named President of the National Committee of Liberation .
Changes this season include only airing one episode a week during the final ten . Coca Cola ended their longtime sponsorship of the show and Ford Motor Company maintained a reduced role . The winner of the season also received a recording contract with Big Machine Records .
As of 2013 , the American Idol alumni in their post-Idol careers have amassed over 59 million albums and 120 million singles and digital track downloads in the United States alone .
The senate 's ultimate authority derived from the esteem and prestige of the senators . This esteem and prestige was based on both precedent and custom , as well as the caliber and reputation of the senators . The senate passed decrees , which were called senatus consulta . These were officially " advice " from the senate to a magistrate . In practice , however , they were usually followed by the magistrates . The focus of the Roman senate was usually directed towards foreign policy . Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict , the senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs . The power of the senate expanded over time as the power of the legislative assemblies declined , and the senate took a greater role in ordinary law-making . Its members were usually appointed by Roman Censors , who ordinarily selected newly elected magistrates for membership in the senate , making the senate a partially elected body . During times of military emergency , such as the civil wars of the 1st century BC , this practice became less prevalent , as the Roman Dictator , Triumvir or the senate itself would select its members .
The Greater Richmond area was named the third-best city for business by MarketWatch in September 2007 , ranking behind only the Minneapolis and Denver areas and just above Boston . The area is home to six Fortune 500 companies : electric utility Dominion Resources ; CarMax ; Owens & Minor ; Genworth Financial ; MeadWestvaco ; McKesson Medical-Surgical and Altria Group . However , only Dominion Resources and MeadWestvaco are headquartered within the city of Richmond ; the others are located in the neighboring counties of Henrico and Hanover . In 2008 , Altria moved its corporate HQ from New York City to Henrico County , adding another Fortune 500 corporation to Richmond 's list . In February 2006 , MeadWestvaco announced that they would move from Stamford , Connecticut , to Richmond in 2008 with the help of the Greater Richmond Partnership , a regional economic development organization that also helped locate Aditya Birla Minacs , Amazon.com , and Honeywell International , to the region .
From January 18–20 , 2010 a national conference on Tibet and areas inhabited by Tibetans in Sichuan , Yunnan , Gansu and Qinghai was held in China and a substantial plan to improve development of the areas was announced . The conference was attended by General secretary Hu Jintao , Wu Bangguo , Wen Jiabao , Jia Qinglin , Li Changchun , Xi Jinping , Li Keqiang , He Guoqiang and Zhou Yongkang , all members of CPC Politburo Standing Committee signaling the commitment of senior Chinese leaders to development of Tibet and ethnic Tibetan areas . The plan calls for improvement of rural Tibetan income to national standards by 2020 and free education for all rural Tibetan children . China has invested 310 billion yuan ( about 45.6 billion U.S. dollars ) in Tibet since 2001 . " Tibet 's GDP was expected to reach 43.7 billion yuan in 2009 , up 170 percent from that in 2000 and posting an annual growth of 12.3 percent over the past nine years . "
Other religions that form a small percentage are Buddhism and Sikhism . The Lahaulis of Lahaul and Spiti region are mainly Buddhists . Sikhs mostly live in towns and cities and constitute 1.16 % of the state population . For example , they form 10 % of the population in Una District adjoining the state of Punjab and 17 % in Shimla , the state capital . The Buddhists constitute 1.15 % are mainly natives and tribals from Lahaul and Spiti , where they form majority of 60 % and Kinnaur where they form 40 % , however the bulk are refugees from Tibet . The Muslims constitute slightly 2.18 % of the population of Himachal Pradesh .
Dell committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its global activities by 40 % by 2015 , with 2008 fiscal year as the baseline year . It is listed in Greenpeace’s Guide to Greener Electronics that scores leading electronics manufacturers according to their policies on sustainability , climate and energy and how green their products are . In November 2011 , Dell ranked 2nd out of 15 listed electronics makers ( increasing its score to 5.1 from 4.9 , which it gained in the previous ranking from October 2010 ) .
On February 11 , 2004 , Comcast announced a $ 54 billion bid for The Walt Disney Company , as well as taking on $ 12 billion of Disney 's debt . The deal would have made Comcast the largest media conglomerate in the world . However , after rejection by Disney and uncertain response from investors , the bid was abandoned in April . The main reason for the buyout attempt was so that Comcast could acquire Disney 's 80 percent stake in ESPN , which a Comcast executive called " the most important and valuable asset " that Disney owned .
In Western societies , skirts , dresses and high-heeled shoes are usually seen as women 's clothing , while neckties are usually seen as men 's clothing . Trousers were once seen as exclusively male clothing , but are nowadays worn by both genders . Male clothes are often more practical ( that is , they can function well under a wide variety of situations ) , but a wider range of clothing styles are available for females . Males are typically allowed to bare their chests in a greater variety of public places . It is generally acceptable for a woman to wear traditionally male clothing , while the converse is unusual .
Thus , only in 1944 did the U.S. Navy begin to use its 150 submarines to maximum effect : installing effective shipboard radar , replacing commanders deemed lacking in aggression , and fixing the faults in the torpedoes . Japanese commerce protection was " shiftless beyond description , " [ nb 14 ] and convoys were poorly organized and defended compared to Allied ones , a product of flawed IJN doctrine and training – errors concealed by American faults as much as Japanese overconfidence . The number of U.S. submarines patrols ( and sinkings ) rose steeply : 350 patrols ( 180 ships sunk ) in 1942 , 350 ( 335 ) in 1943 , and 520 ( 603 ) in 1944 . By 1945 , sinkings of Japanese vessels had decreased because so few targets dared to venture out on the high seas . In all , Allied submarines destroyed 1,200 merchant ships – about five million tons of shipping . Most were small cargo-carriers , but 124 were tankers bringing desperately needed oil from the East Indies . Another 320 were passenger ships and troop transports . At critical stages of the Guadalcanal , Saipan , and Leyte campaigns , thousands of Japanese troops were killed or diverted from where they were needed . Over 200 warships were sunk , ranging from many auxiliaries and destroyers to one battleship and no fewer than eight carriers .
As regards publication titles it is , however , a common typographic practice among both British and U.S. publishers to capitalise significant words ( and in the United States , this is often applied to headings , too ) . This family of typographic conventions is usually called title case . For example , R. M. Ritter 's Oxford Manual of Style ( 2002 ) suggests capitalising " the first word and all nouns , pronouns , adjectives , verbs and adverbs , but generally not articles , conjunctions and short prepositions " . This is an old form of emphasis , similar to the more modern practice of using a larger or boldface font for titles . The rules for which words to capitalise are not based on any grammatically inherent correct/incorrect distinction and are not universally standardized ; they are arbitrary and differ between style guides , although in most styles they tend to follow a few strong conventions , as follows :
Initially sympathetic to Wieser 's democratic socialism , Hayek 's economic thinking shifted away from socialism and toward the classical liberalism of Carl Menger after reading von Mises ' book Socialism . It was sometime after reading Socialism that Hayek began attending von Mises ' private seminars , joining several of his university friends , including Fritz Machlup , Alfred Schutz , Felix Kaufmann , and Gottfried Haberler , who were also participating in Hayek 's own , more general , private seminar . It was during this time that he also encountered and befriended noted political philosopher Eric Voegelin , with whom he retained a long-standing relationship .
The Archaic period in the Americas saw a changing environment featuring a warmer more arid climate and the disappearance of the last megafauna . The majority of population groups at this time were still highly mobile hunter-gatherers ; but now individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally , thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization like , the Southwest , Arctic , Poverty , Dalton and Plano traditions . This regional adaptations would become the norm , with reliance less on hunting and gathering , with a more mixed economy of small game , fish , seasonally wild vegetables and harvested plant foods .
At about this time the surrounding areas experienced recurring fragmentation and reincorporations among a number of feudal secular and ecclesiastical lordships , a common process in the Holy Roman Empire . Alsace experienced great prosperity during the 12th and 13th centuries under Hohenstaufen emperors . Frederick I set up Alsace as a province ( a procuratio , not a provincia ) to be ruled by ministeriales , a non-noble class of civil servants . The idea was that such men would be more tractable and less likely to alienate the fief from the crown out of their own greed . The province had a single provincial court ( Landgericht ) and a central administration with its seat at Hagenau . Frederick II designated the Bishop of Strasbourg to administer Alsace , but the authority of the bishop was challenged by Count Rudolf of Habsburg , who received his rights from Frederick II 's son Conrad IV . Strasbourg began to grow to become the most populous and commercially important town in the region . In 1262 , after a long struggle with the ruling bishops , its citizens gained the status of free imperial city . A stop on the Paris-Vienna-Orient trade route , as well as a port on the Rhine route linking southern Germany and Switzerland to the Netherlands , England and Scandinavia , it became the political and economic center of the region . Cities such as Colmar and Hagenau also began to grow in economic importance and gained a kind of autonomy within the " Decapole " or " Dekapolis " , a federation of ten free towns .
The timing of migration seems to be controlled primarily by changes in day length . Migrating birds navigate using celestial cues from the sun and stars , the earth 's magnetic field , and probably also mental maps .
The commercial rivalry between RCA Victor and Columbia Records led to RCA Victor 's introduction of what it had intended to be a competing vinyl format , the 7-inch ( 175 mm ) 45 rpm disc . For a two-year period from 1948 to 1950 , record companies and consumers faced uncertainty over which of these formats would ultimately prevail in what was known as the " War of the Speeds " . ( See also format war . ) In 1949 Capitol and Decca adopted the new LP format and RCA gave in and issued its first LP in January 1950 . The 45 rpm size was gaining in popularity , too , and Columbia issued its first 45s in February 1951 . By 1954 , 200 million 45s had been sold .
By 17 May , the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld . Charles kept the bulk of his troops several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross . On 21 May , the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube , precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling . The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle ; on the first day , Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon . By the second day , reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000 . The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling , the focal points of the French bridgehead . By the end of the fighting , the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling . A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island . Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other . It was the first defeat Napoleon suffered in a major set-piece battle , and it caused excitement throughout many parts of Europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield .
IBM acquired Kenexa ( 2012 ) and SPSS ( 2009 ) and PwC 's consulting business ( 2002 ) , spinning off companies like printer manufacturer Lexmark ( 1991 ) , and selling off product lines like its personal computer and x86 server businesses to Lenovo ( 2005 , 2014 ) . In 2014 , IBM announced that it would go " fabless " by offloading IBM Micro Electronics semiconductor manufacturing to GlobalFoundries , a leader in advanced technology manufacturing , citing that semiconductor manufacturing is a capital-intensive business which is challenging to operate without scale . This transition had progressed as of early 2015 [ update ] .
The Pitchfork online music publication ranked My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy as the world 's best album of the decade " so far " —between 2010 and 2014—on August 19 , 2014 , while Yeezus was ranked in the eighth position of a list of 100 albums . During the same week , the song " Runaway " ( featuring Pusha T ) was ranked in the third position in the publication 's list of the 200 " best tracks " released since 2010 .
By the late Eastern Han period , an early form of semi-cursive script appeared , developing out of a cursively written form of neo-clerical script [ c ] and simple cursive . This semi-cursive script was traditionally attributed to Liu Desheng c. 147–188 AD , [ d ] although such attributions refer to early masters of a script rather than to their actual inventors , since the scripts generally evolved into being over time . Qiu gives examples of early semi-cursive script , showing that it had popular origins rather than being purely Liu’s invention .
In the last years of the 19th century the term " Near East " acquired considerable disrepute in eyes of the English-speaking public as did the Ottoman Empire itself . The cause of the onus was the Hamidian Massacres of Armenians because they were Christians , but it seemed to spill over into the protracted conflicts of the Balkans . For a time , " Near East " meant primarily the Balkans . Robert Hichens ' book The Near East ( 1913 ) is subtitled Dalmatia , Greece and Constantinople .
Richmond recovered quickly from the war , and by 1782 was once again a thriving city . In 1786 , the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom ( drafted by Thomas Jefferson ) was passed at the temporary capitol in Richmond , providing the basis for the separation of church and state , a key element in the development of the freedom of religion in the United States . A permanent home for the new government , the Virginia State Capitol building , was designed by Thomas Jefferson with the assistance of Charles-Louis Clérisseau , and was completed in 1788 .
During the 1950s and 1960s , FBI officials became increasingly concerned about the influence of civil rights leaders , whom they believed had communist ties or were unduly influenced by them . In 1956 , for example , Hoover sent an open letter denouncing Dr. T.R.M . Howard , a civil rights leader , surgeon , and wealthy entrepreneur in Mississippi who had criticized FBI inaction in solving recent murders of George W. Lee , Emmett Till , and other blacks in the South . The FBI carried out controversial domestic surveillance in an operation it called the COINTELPRO , which was short for " COunter-INTELligence PROgram . " It was to investigate and disrupt the activities of dissident political organizations within the United States , including both militant and non-violent organizations . Among its targets was the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , a leading civil rights organization with clergy leadership .
In Lebanon , clashes between pro-Nasser factions and supporters of staunch Nasser opponent , then-President Camille Chamoun , culminated in civil strife by May . The former sought to unite with the UAR , while the latter sought Lebanon 's continued independence . Nasser delegated oversight of the issue to Sarraj , who provided limited aid to Nasser 's Lebanese supporters through money , light arms , and officer training—short of the large-scale support that Chamoun alleged . Nasser did not covet Lebanon , seeing it as a " special case " , but sought to prevent Chamoun from a second presidential term .
Jean Macfarlane founded the University of California , Berkeley 's Institute of Human Development , formerly called the Institute of Child Welfare , in 1927 . The Institute was instrumental in initiating studies of healthy development , in contrast to previous work that had been dominated by theories based on pathological personalities . The studies looked at human development during the Great Depression and World War II , unique historical circumstances under which a generation of children grew up . The Oakland Growth Study , initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in 1931 , aimed to study the physical , intellectual , and social development of children in the Oakland area . Data collection began in 1932 and continued until 1981 , allowing the researchers to gather longitudinal data on the individuals that extended past adolescence into adulthood . Jean Macfarlane launched the Berkeley Guidance Study , which examined the development of children in terms of their socioeconomic and family backgrounds . These studies provided the background for Glen Elder in the 1960s , to propose a life-course perspective of adolescent development . Elder formulated several descriptive principles of adolescent development . The principle of historical time and place states that an individual 's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up . The principle of the importance of timing in one 's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one 's life they occur . The idea of linked lives states that one 's development is shaped by the interconnected network of relationships of which one is a part ; and the principle of human agency asserts that one 's life course is constructed via the choices and actions of an individual within the context of their historical period and social network .
Virtually all console gaming systems of the previous generation used microprocessors developed by IBM . The Xbox 360 contains a PowerPC tri-core processor , which was designed and produced by IBM in less than 24 months . Sony 's PlayStation 3 features the Cell BE microprocessor designed jointly by IBM , Toshiba , and Sony . IBM also provided the microprocessor that serves as the heart of Nintendo 's new Wii U system , which debuted in 2012 . The new Power Architecture-based microprocessor includes IBM 's latest technology in an energy-saving silicon package . Nintendo 's seventh-generation console , Wii , features an IBM chip codenamed Broadway . The older Nintendo GameCube utilizes the Gekko processor , also designed by IBM .
The doctrine of the immaculate conception ( Mary being conceived free from original sin ) is not to be confused with her virginal conception of her son Jesus . This misunderstanding of the term immaculate conception is frequently met in the mass media . Catholics believe that Mary was not the product of a virginal conception herself but was the daughter of a human father and mother , traditionally known by the names of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne . In 1677 , the Holy See condemned the belief that Mary was virginally conceived , which had been a belief surfacing occasionally since the 4th century . The Church celebrates the Feast of the Immaculate Conception ( when Mary was conceived free from original sin ) on 8 December , exactly nine months before celebrating the Nativity of Mary . The feast of the Annunciation ( which commemorates the virginal conception and the Incarnation of Jesus ) is celebrated on 25 March , nine months before Christmas Day .
According to the apocryphal Gospel of James , Mary was the daughter of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne . Before Mary 's conception , Anne had been barren and was far advanced in years . Mary was given to service as a consecrated virgin in the Temple in Jerusalem when she was three years old , much like Hannah took Samuel to the Tabernacle as recorded in the Old Testament . Some apocryphal accounts state that at the time of her betrothal to Joseph , Mary was 12–14 years old , and he was thirty years old , but such accounts are unreliable .
An Ancient Chinese document from the 9th century referred to the northern Somali coast — which was then called " Berbera " by Arab geographers in reference to the region 's " Berber " ( Cushitic ) inhabitants — as Po-pa-li . The first clear written reference of the sobriquet Somali , however , dates back to the 15th century . During the wars between the Sultanate of Ifat based at Zeila and the Solomonic Dynasty , the Abyssinian Emperor had one of his court officials compose a hymn celebrating a military victory over the Sultan of Ifat 's eponymous troops .
After Charles II of England ( 1630–1685 ) was restored to the English throne in 1660 following Oliver Cromwell 's Protectorate , he granted the chartered Province of Carolina to eight of his loyal friends , known as the Lords Proprietors , on March 24 , 1663 . It took seven years before the group arranged for settlement expeditions . The first of these founded Charles Town , in 1670 . Governance , settlement , and development were to follow a visionary plan known as the Grand Model prepared for the Lords Proprietors by John Locke .
Compaq , who had previously held the third place spot among PC manufacturers during the 1980s and early-mid 1990s , initiated a successful price war in 1994 that vaulted them to the biggest by the year end , overtaking a struggling IBM and relegating Apple to third place . Apple 's market share further struggled due to the release of the Windows 95 operating system , which unified Microsoft 's formerly separate MS-DOS and Windows products . Windows 95 significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of IBM PC compatible computers , and brought the capabilities of Windows to parity with the Mac OS GUI .
The Recommended Exposure Index ( REI ) technique , new in the 2006 version of the standard , allows the manufacturer to specify a camera model’s EI choices arbitrarily . The choices are based solely on the manufacturer’s opinion of what EI values produce well-exposed sRGB images at the various sensor sensitivity settings . This is the only technique available under the standard for output formats that are not in the sRGB color space . This is also the only technique available under the standard when multi-zone metering ( also called pattern metering ) is used .
It is fairly clear that predators tend to lower the survival and fecundity of their prey , but on a higher level of organization , populations of predator and prey species also interact . It is obvious that predators depend on prey for survival , and this is reflected in predator populations being affected by changes in prey populations . It is not so obvious , however , that predators affect prey populations . Eating a prey organism may simply make room for another if the prey population is approaching its carrying capacity .
Detroit is the center of a three-county urban area ( population 3,734,090 , area of 1,337 square miles ( 3,460 km2 ) , a 2010 United States Census ) six-county metropolitan statistical area ( 2010 Census population of 4,296,250 , area of 3,913 square miles [ 10,130 km2 ] ) , and a nine-county Combined Statistical Area ( 2010 Census population of 5,218,852 , area of 5,814 square miles [ 15,060 km2 ] ) . The Detroit–Windsor area , a commercial link straddling the Canada–U.S . border , has a total population of about 5,700,000 . The Detroit metropolitan region holds roughly one-half of Michigan 's population .
Since the Protestant Reformation , the most prominent Christian denomination in Thuringia has been Lutheranism . During the GDR period , church membership was discouraged and has continued shrinking since the reunification in 1990 . Today over two thirds of the population is non-religious . The Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany has had the largest number of members in the state , adhered to by 24.0 % of the population in 2009 . Members of the Catholic Church formed 7.8 % of the population , while 68.2 % of Thuringians were non-religious or adhere to other faiths . The highest Protestant concentrations are in the small villages of southern and western Thuringia , whereas the bigger cities are even more non-religious ( up to 88 % in Gera ) . Catholic regions are the Eichsfeld in the northwest and parts of the Rhön Mountains around Geisa in the southwest . Protestant church membership is shrinking rapidly , whereas the Catholic Church is somewhat more stable because of Catholic migration from Poland , Southern Europe and West Germany . Other religions play no significant role in Thuringia . There are only a few thousand Muslims ( largely migrants ) and about 750 Jews ( mostly migrants from Russia ) living in Thuringia . Furthermore , there are some Orthodox communities of Eastern European migrants and some traditional Protestant Free churches in Thuringia without any societal influence .
Many applications of silicate glasses derive from their optical transparency , which gives rise to one of silicate glasses ' primary uses as window panes . Glass will transmit , reflect and refract light ; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses , prisms , fine glassware , and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light . Glass can be colored by adding metallic salts , and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels . These qualities have led to the extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular , stained glass windows . Although brittle , silicate glass is extremely durable , and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures . Because glass can be formed or molded into any shape , and also because it is a sterile product , it has been traditionally used for vessels : bowls , vases , bottles , jars and drinking glasses . In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights , marbles , and beads . When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air , it becomes a thermal insulating material , and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic , they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass . Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material , such as drinking glasses and reading glasses .
Nasser was greatly influenced by Egyptian nationalism , as espoused by politician Mustafa Kamel , poet Ahmed Shawqi , and his anti-colonialist instructor at the Royal Military Academy , Aziz al-Masri , to whom Nasser expressed his gratitude in a 1961 newspaper interview . He was especially influenced by Egyptian writer Tawfiq al-Hakim 's novel Return of the Spirit , in which al-Hakim wrote that the Egyptian people were only in need of a " man in whom all their feelings and desires will be represented , and who will be for them a symbol of their objective " . Nasser later credited the novel as his inspiration to launch the 1952 revolution .
West , alongside his mother , founded the " Kanye West Foundation " in Chicago in 2003 , tasked with a mission to battle dropout and illiteracy rates , while partnering with community organizations to provide underprivileged youth access to music education . In 2007 , the West and the Foundation partnered with Strong American Schools as part of their " Ed in '08 " campaign . As spokesman for the campaign , West appeared in a series of PSAs for the organization , and hosted an inaugural benefit concert in August of that year .
Modern font technology provides a means to address the practical issue of needing to depict a unified Han character in terms of a collection of alternative glyph representations , in the form of Unicode variation sequences . For example , the Advanced Typographic tables of OpenType permit one of a number of alternative glyph representations to be selected when performing the character to glyph mapping process . In this case , information can be provided within plain text to designate which alternate character form to select .
The doctrines of the Assumption or Dormition of Mary relate to her death and bodily assumption to Heaven . The Roman Catholic Church has dogmaically defined the doctrine of the Assumption , which was done in 1950 by Pope Pius XII in Munificentissimus Deus . Whether the Virgin Mary died or not is not defined dogmatically , however , although a reference to the death of Mary are made in Munificentissimus Deus . In the Eastern Orthodox Church , the Assumption of the Virgin Mary is believed , and celebrated with her Dormition , where they believe she died .
From its base in India , the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s . This trade , illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729 , helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea , which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China . In 1839 , the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War , and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island , at that time a minor settlement .
Originating as a popular form of entertainment in 19th-century Europe and later as a sideshow exhibition in North American traveling carnivals and vaudeville halls , professional wrestling grew into a standalone genre of entertainment with many diverse variations in cultures around the globe , and is now considered a multimillion-dollar entertainment industry . While it has greatly declined in Europe , in North America it has experienced several different periods of prominent cultural popularity during its century and a half of existence . The advent of television gave professional wrestling a new outlet , and wrestling ( along with boxing ) was instrumental in making pay-per-view a viable method of content delivery .
Several websites assert that Israel is the 51st state due to the annual funding and defense support it receives from the United States . An example of this concept can be found in 2003 when Martine Rothblatt published a book called Two Stars for Peace that argued for the addition of Israel and the Palestinian territories surrounding it as the 51st state in the Union . The American State of Canaan , is a book published by Prof. Alfred de Grazia , political science and sociologist , in March 2009 , proposing the creation of the 51st and 52nd states from Israel and the Palestinian territories .
An early formal system of temporal logic was studied by Avicenna . Although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions , he did study the relationship between temporalis and the implication . Avicenna 's work was further developed by Najm al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī and became the dominant system of Islamic logic until modern times . Avicennian logic also influenced several early European logicians such as Albertus Magnus and William of Ockham . Avicenna endorsed the law of noncontradiction proposed by Aristotle , that a fact could not be both true and false at the same time and in the same sense of the terminology used . He stated , " Anyone who denies the law of noncontradiction should be beaten and burned until he admits that to be beaten is not the same as not to be beaten , and to be burned is not the same as not to be burned . "
In 1880 , the newspapers News and Observer combined to form The News & Observer . It remains Raleigh 's primary daily newspaper . The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts , now known as North Carolina State University , was founded as a land-grant college in 1887 . The city 's Rex Hospital opened in 1889 and included the state 's first nursing school . The Baptist Women 's College , now known as Meredith College , opened in 1891 , and in 1898 , The Academy of Music , a private music conservatory , was established .
A thriving market of unlicensed NES hardware clones emerged during the climax of the console 's popularity . Initially , such clones were popular in markets where Nintendo never issued a legitimate version of the console . In particular , the Dendy ( Russian : Де́нди ) , an unlicensed hardware clone produced in Taiwan and sold in the former Soviet Union , emerged as the most popular video game console of its time in that setting and it enjoyed a degree of fame roughly equivalent to that experienced by the NES/Famicom in North America and Japan . A Famicom clone was marketed in Argentina under the name of " Family Game " , resembling the original hardware design . The Micro Genius ( Simplified Chinese : 小天才 ) was marketed in Southeast Asia as an alternative to the Famicom ; Samurai was the popular PAL alternative to the NES ; and in Central Europe , especially Poland , the Pegasus was available . Samurai was also available in India in early 90s which was the first instance of console gaming in India .
Beyoncé is believed to have first started a relationship with Jay Z after a collaboration on " '03 Bonnie & Clyde " , which appeared on his seventh album The Blueprint 2 : The Gift & The Curse ( 2002 ) . Beyoncé appeared as Jay Z 's girlfriend in the music video for the song , which would further fuel speculation of their relationship . On April 4 , 2008 , Beyoncé and Jay Z were married without publicity . As of April 2014 , the couple have sold a combined 300 million records together . The couple are known for their private relationship , although they have appeared to become more relaxed in recent years . Beyoncé suffered a miscarriage in 2010 or 2011 , describing it as " the saddest thing " she had ever endured . She returned to the studio and wrote music in order to cope with the loss . In April 2011 , Beyoncé and Jay Z traveled to Paris in order to shoot the album cover for her 4 , and unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris .
The Partisan Prohibitions were repealed during the Yellow Turban Rebellion and Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion in 184 AD , largely because the court did not want to continue to alienate a significant portion of the gentry class who might otherwise join the rebellions . The Yellow Turbans and Five-Pecks-of-Rice adherents belonged to two different hierarchical Daoist religious societies led by faith healers Zhang Jue ( d. 184 AD ) and Zhang Lu ( d. 216 AD ) , respectively . Zhang Lu 's rebellion , in modern northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi , was not quelled until 215 AD . Zhang Jue 's massive rebellion across eight provinces was annihilated by Han forces within a year , however the following decades saw much smaller recurrent uprisings . Although the Yellow Turbans were defeated , many generals appointed during the crisis never disbanded their assembled militia forces and used these troops to amass power outside of the collapsing imperial authority .
North Carolina State University is located in southwest Raleigh where the Wolfpack competes nationally in 24 intercollegiate varsity sports as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference . The university 's football team plays in Carter-Finley Stadium , the third largest football stadium in North Carolina , while the men 's basketball team shares the PNC Arena with the Carolina Hurricanes hockey club . The Wolfpack women 's basketball , volleyball , and gymnastics as well as men 's wrestling events are held on campus at Reynolds Coliseum . The men 's baseball team plays at Doak Field .
Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter ( /biːˈjɒnseɪ/ bee-YON-say ) ( born September 4 , 1981 ) is an American singer , songwriter , record producer and actress . Born and raised in Houston , Texas , she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child , and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R & B girl-group Destiny 's Child . Managed by her father , Mathew Knowles , the group became one of the world 's best-selling girl groups of all time . Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé 's debut album , Dangerously in Love ( 2003 ) , which established her as a solo artist worldwide , earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles " Crazy in Love " and " Baby Boy " .
Historically Whitehead 's work has been most influential in the field of American progressive theology . The most important early proponent of Whitehead 's thought in a theological context was Charles Hartshorne , who spent a semester at Harvard as Whitehead 's teaching assistant in 1925 , and is widely credited with developing Whitehead 's process philosophy into a full-blown process theology . Other notable process theologians include John B. Cobb , Jr. , David Ray Griffin , Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki , C. Robert Mesle , Roland Faber , and Catherine Keller .
No one party to a treaty can impose its particular interpretation of the treaty upon the other parties . Consent may be implied , however , if the other parties fail to explicitly disavow that initially unilateral interpretation , particularly if that state has acted upon its view of the treaty without complaint . Consent by all parties to the treaty to a particular interpretation has the legal effect of adding another clause to the treaty – this is commonly called an 'authentic interpretation ' .
CNET awarded PS3 Slim four out of five stars praising its Blu-ray capabilities , 120 GB hard drive , free online gaming service and more affordable pricing point , but complained about the lack of backward compatibility for PlayStation 2 games . TechRadar gave PS3 Slim four and a half stars out of five praising its new smaller size and summed up its review stating " Over all , the PS3 Slim is a phenomenal piece of kit . It 's amazing that something so small can do so much " . However , they criticized the exterior design and the build quality in relation to the original model .
Perhaps foremost among what Whitehead considered faulty metaphysical assumptions was the Cartesian idea that reality is fundamentally constructed of bits of matter that exist totally independently of one another , which he rejected in favor of an event-based or " process " ontology in which events are primary and are fundamentally interrelated and dependent on one another . He also argued that the most basic elements of reality can all be regarded as experiential , indeed that everything is constituted by its experience . He used the term " experience " very broadly , so that even inanimate processes such as electron collisions are said to manifest some degree of experience . In this , he went against Descartes ' separation of two different kinds of real existence , either exclusively material or else exclusively mental . Whitehead referred to his metaphysical system as " philosophy of organism " , but it would become known more widely as " process philosophy . "
On 18 September , Stalin dispatched General H. M. Zakharov to Korea to advise Kim Il-sung to halt his offensive around the Pusan perimeter and to redeploy his forces to defend Seoul . Chinese commanders were not briefed on North Korean troop numbers or operational plans . As the overall commander of Chinese forces , Zhou Enlai suggested that the North Koreans should attempt to eliminate the enemy forces at Inchon only if they had reserves of at least 100,000 men ; otherwise , he advised the North Koreans to withdraw their forces north .
In Britain and some other armies , the single artillery branch has been responsible for both home and overseas ground-based air defence , although there was divided responsibility with the Royal Navy for air defence of the British Isles in World War I . However , during the Second World War the RAF Regiment was formed to protect airfields everywhere , and this included light air defences . In the later decades of the Cold War this included the United States Air Force 's operating bases in UK . However , all ground-based air defence was removed from Royal Air Force ( RAF ) jurisdiction in 2004 . The British Army 's Anti-Aircraft Command was disbanded in March 1955 , but during the 1960s and 1970s the RAF 's Fighter Command operated long-range air -defence missiles to protect key areas in the UK . During World War II the Royal Marines also provided air defence units ; formally part of the mobile naval base defence organisation , they were handled as an integral part of the army-commanded ground based air defences .
Video games are playable on various versions of iPods . The original iPod had the game Brick ( originally invented by Apple 's co-founder Steve Wozniak ) included as an easter egg hidden feature ; later firmware versions added it as a menu option . Later revisions of the iPod added three more games : Parachute , Solitaire , and Music Quiz .
Hayek also wrote that the state can play a role in the economy , and specifically , in creating a " safety net " . He wrote , " There is no reason why , in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has , the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom ; that is : some minimum of food , shelter and clothing , sufficient to preserve health . Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision . "
The U.S. Navy , by contrast , relied on commerce raiding from the outset . However , the problem of Allied forces surrounded in the Philippines , during the early part of 1942 , led to diversion of boats to " guerrilla submarine " missions . As well , basing in Australia placed boats under Japanese aerial threat while en route to patrol areas , reducing their effectiveness , and Nimitz relied on submarines for close surveillance of enemy bases . Furthermore , the standard-issue Mark 14 torpedo and its Mark VI exploder both proved defective , problems which were not corrected until September 1943 . Worst of all , before the war , an uninformed US Customs officer had seized a copy of the Japanese merchant marine code ( called the " maru code " in the USN ) , not knowing that the Office of Naval Intelligence ( ONI ) had broken it . The Japanese promptly changed it , and the new code was not broken again by OP-20G until 1943 .
In addition to Somali , Arabic , which is also an Afro-Asiatic tongue , is an official national language in both Somalia and Djibouti . Many Somalis speak it due to centuries-old ties with the Arab world , the far-reaching influence of the Arabic media , and religious education . Somalia and Djibouti are also both members of the Arab League .
Migrating birds can lose their way and appear outside their normal ranges . This can be due to flying past their destinations as in the " spring overshoot " in which birds returning to their breeding areas overshoot and end up further north than intended . Certain areas , because of their location , have become famous as watchpoints for such birds . Examples are the Point Pelee National Park in Canada , and Spurn in England .
Efforts by local kings to fight the invaders led to the formation of new political entities . In Anglo-Saxon England , King Alfred the Great ( r. 871–899 ) came to an agreement with the Viking invaders in the late 9th century , resulting in Danish settlements in Northumbria , Mercia , and parts of East Anglia . By the middle of the 10th century , Alfred 's successors had conquered Northumbria , and restored English control over most of the southern part of Great Britain . In northern Britain , Kenneth MacAlpin ( d. c. 860 ) united the Picts and the Scots into the Kingdom of Alba . In the early 10th century , the Ottonian dynasty had established itself in Germany , and was engaged in driving back the Magyars . Its efforts culminated in the coronation in 962 of Otto I ( r. 936–973 ) as Holy Roman Emperor . In 972 , he secured recognition of his title by the Byzantine Empire , which he sealed with the marriage of his son Otto II ( r. 967–983 ) to Theophanu ( d. 991 ) , daughter of an earlier Byzantine Emperor Romanos II ( r. 959–963 ) . By the late 10th century Italy had been drawn into the Ottonian sphere after a period of instability ; Otto III ( r. 996–1002 ) spent much of his later reign in the kingdom . The western Frankish kingdom was more fragmented , and although kings remained nominally in charge , much of the political power devolved to the local lords .
The Alps ( /ælps/ ; Italian : Alpi [ ˈalpi ] ; French : Alpes [ alp ] ; German : Alpen [ ˈʔalpm̩ ] ; Slovene : Alpe [ ˈáːlpɛ ] ) are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe , stretching approximately 1,200 kilometres ( 750 mi ) across eight Alpine countries : Austria , France , Germany , Italy , Liechtenstein , Monaco , Slovenia , and Switzerland . The Caucasus Mountains are higher , and the Urals longer , but both lie partly in Asia . The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided . Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn . Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border , and at 4,810 m ( 15,781 ft ) is the highest mountain in the Alps . The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 m ( 13,123 ft ) , known as the " four-thousanders " .
Everton have a large fanbase , with the eighth highest average attendance in the Premier League in the 2008–09 season . The majority of Everton 's matchday support comes from the North West of England , primarily Merseyside , Cheshire , West Lancashire and parts of Western Greater Manchester along with many fans who travel from North Wales and Ireland . Within the city of Liverpool support for Everton and city rivals Liverpool is not determined by geographical basis with supporters mixed across the city . However Everton 's support heartland is traditionally based in the North West of the city and in the southern parts of Sefton . Everton also have many supporters ' clubs worldwide , in places such as North America , Singapore , Indonesia , Lebanon , Malaysia , Thailand , and Australia . The official supporters club is FOREVERTON , and there are also several fanzines including When Skies are Grey and Speke from the Harbour , which are sold around Goodison Park on match days .
The Taiping Rebellion in the mid-19th century was the first major instance of anti-Manchu sentiment threatening the stability of the dynasty . Hong Xiuquan , a failed civil service candidate , led the Taiping Rebellion , amid widespread social unrest and worsening famine . In 1851 Hong Xiuquan and others launched an uprising in Guizhou province , established the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom with Hong himself as king , claiming he often had visions of God and that he was the brother of Jesus Christ . Slavery , concubinage , arranged marriage , opium smoking , footbinding , judicial torture , and the worship of idols were all banned . However , success and subsequent authority and power led to internal feuds , defections and corruption . In addition , British and French troops , equipped with modern weapons , had come to the assistance of the Qing imperial army . It was not until 1864 that Qing armies under Zeng Guofan succeeded in crushing the revolt . The rebellion not only posed the most serious threat towards Qing rulers ; it was also " bloodiest civil war of all time . " Between 20 and 30 million people died during its fourteen-year course from 1850 to 1864 . After the outbreak of this rebellion , there were also revolts by the Muslims and Miao people of China against the Qing dynasty , most notably in the Dungan Revolt ( 1862–77 ) in the northwest and the Panthay Rebellion ( 1856–1873 ) in Yunnan .
Other sources include fortified food and dietary supplements , which come in various forms . A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide , one of the most common supplements in the United States , and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body . This review cited studies which found low plasma zinc concentrations after zinc oxide and zinc carbonate were consumed compared with those seen after consumption of zinc acetate and sulfate salts . However , harmful excessive supplementation is a problem among the relatively affluent , and should probably not exceed 20 mg/day in healthy people , although the U.S. National Research Council set a Tolerable Upper Intake of 40 mg/day .
A day after announcing the attempt on his life , Nasser established a new provisional constitution proclaiming a 600-member National Assembly ( 400 from Egypt and 200 from Syria ) and the dissolution of all political parties . Nasser gave each of the provinces two vice-presidents : Boghdadi and Amer in Egypt , and Sabri al-Asali and Akram al-Hawrani in Syria . Nasser then left for Moscow to meet with Nikita Khrushchev . At the meeting , Khrushchev pressed Nasser to lift the ban on the Communist Party , but Nasser refused , stating it was an internal matter which was not a subject of discussion with outside powers . Khrushchev was reportedly taken aback and denied he had meant to interfere in the UAR 's affairs . The matter was settled as both leaders sought to prevent a rift between their two countries .
Many globally popular sports had modern rules codified in the British Isles , including golf , association football , cricket , rugby , snooker and darts , as well as many minor sports such as croquet , bowls , pitch and putt , water polo and handball . A number of sports are popular throughout the British Isles , the most prominent of which is association football . While this is organised separately in different national associations , leagues and national teams , even within the UK , it is a common passion in all parts of the islands . Rugby union is also widely enjoyed across the islands with four national teams from England , Ireland , Scotland and Wales . The British and Irish Lions is a team chosen from each national team and undertakes tours of the southern hemisphere rugby playing nations every four years . Ireland play as a united team , represented by players from both Northern Ireland and the Republic . These national rugby teams play each other each year for the Triple Crown as part of the Six Nations Championship . Also since 2001 the professional club teams of Ireland , Scotland , Wales and Italy compete against each other in the RaboDirect Pro12 .
The relationships adolescents have with their peers , family , and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent . As an adolescent 's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances , they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends . This is not harmful ; however , if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations , this is an aspect of peer pressure . Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with . This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions , which also makes this a sensitive period . Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual . These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities , how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality . " The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation . In other words , by comparing one person 's personality characteristics to another 's , we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality ( and , ... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons ) . " This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one’s identity and self-concept , which includes ones personality , and underscores the importance of communication , and thus relationships , in one’s development . In social comparison we use reference groups , with respect to both psychological and identity development . These reference groups are the peers of adolescents . This means that who the teen chooses/accepts as their friends and who they communicate with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore have a huge impact on who they become . Research shows that relationships have the largest affect over the social development of an individual .
The War on Terrorism is a global effort by the governments of several countries ( primarily the United States and its principal allies ) to neutralize international terrorist groups ( primarily Islamic Extremist terrorist groups , including al-Qaeda ) and ensure that countries considered by the US and some of its allies to be Rogue Nations no longer support terrorist activities . It has been adopted primarily as a response to the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States . Since 2001 , terrorist motivated attacks upon service members have occurred in Arkansas and Texas .
When the news arrived at Paris of the surrender at Sedan of Napoleon III and 80,000 men , the Second Empire was overthrown by a popular uprising in Paris , which forced the proclamation of a Provisional Government and a Third Republic by general Trochu , Favre and Gambetta at Paris on 4 September , the new government calling itself the Government of National Defence . After the German victory at Sedan , most of the French standing army was either besieged in Metz or prisoner of the Germans , who hoped for an armistice and an end to the war . Bismarck wanted an early peace but had difficulty in finding a legitimate French authority with which to negotiate . The Government of National Defence had no electoral mandate , the Emperor was a captive and the Empress in exile but there had been no abdication de jure and the army was still bound by an oath of allegiance to the defunct imperial régime .
Another work from Ancient Greece that made an early impact on botany is De Materia Medica , a five-volume encyclopedia about herbal medicine written in the middle of the first century by Greek physician and pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides . De Materia Medica was widely read for more than 1,500 years . Important contributions from the medieval Muslim world include Ibn Wahshiyya 's Nabatean Agriculture , Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī 's ( 828–896 ) the Book of Plants , and Ibn Bassal 's The Classification of Soils . In the early 13th century , Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati , and Ibn al-Baitar ( d. 1248 ) wrote on botany in a systematic and scientific manner .
In 1922 , John Jacob Astor , son of the 1st Viscount Astor , bought The Times from the Northcliffe estate . The paper gained a measure of notoriety in the 1930s with its advocacy of German appeasement ; then-editor Geoffrey Dawson was closely allied with those in the government who practised appeasement , most notably Neville Chamberlain .
Molecular studies based on DNA analysis have suggested new relationships among mammal families over the last few years . Most of these findings have been independently validated by retrotransposon presence/absence data . Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental mammals- Afrotheria , Xenarthra , and Boreoeutheria- which diverged from early common ancestors in the Cretaceous . The relationships between these three lineages is contentious , and all three possible different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal with respect to other placentals . These hypotheses are Atlantogenata ( basal Boreoeutheria ) , Epitheria ( basal Xenarthra ) , and Exafroplacentalia ( basal Afrotheria ) . Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages- Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria .
To pay for his military campaigns and colonial expansion , Emperor Wu nationalized several private industries . He created central government monopolies administered largely by former merchants . These monopolies included salt , iron , and liquor production , as well as bronze-coin currency . The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC , and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han . The issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly throughout the rest of the Han dynasty . The government monopolies were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the Reformists gained greater influence in the court . The Reformists opposed the Modernist faction that had dominated court politics in Emperor Wu 's reign and during the subsequent regency of Huo Guang ( d. 68 BC ) . The Modernists argued for an aggressive and expansionary foreign policy supported by revenues from heavy government intervention in the private economy . The Reformists , however , overturned these policies , favoring a cautious , non-expansionary approach to foreign policy , frugal budget reform , and lower tax-rates imposed on private entrepreneurs .
Spinal cord fibers dedicated to carrying A-delta fiber pain signals , and others that carry both A-delta and C fiber pain signals up the spinal cord to the thalamus in the brain have been identified . Other spinal cord fibers , known as wide dynamic range neurons , respond to A-delta and C fibers , but also to the large A-beta fibers that carry touch , pressure and vibration signals . Pain-related activity in the thalamus spreads to the insular cortex ( thought to embody , among other things , the feeling that distinguishes pain from other homeostatic emotions such as itch and nausea ) and anterior cingulate cortex ( thought to embody , among other things , the motivational element of pain ) ; and pain that is distinctly located also activates the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices . Melzack and Casey 's 1968 picture of the dimensions of pain is as influential today as ever , firmly framing theory and guiding research in the functional neuroanatomy and psychology of pain .
Moisture absorption occurs when the material is exposed to high humidity or water . Both the resin and the reinforcement may absorb water ; water may be also soaked by capillary forces through voids in the materials and along the reinforcement . Epoxies of the FR-4 materials are n't too susceptible , with absorption of only 0.15 % . Teflon has very low absorption of 0.01 % . Polyimides and cyanate esters , on the other side , suffer from high water absorption . Absorbed water can lead to significant degradation of key parameters ; it impairs tracking resistance , breakdown voltage , and dielectric parameters . Relative dielectric constant of water is about 73 , compared to about 4 for common circuitboard materials . Absorbed moisture can also vaporize on heating and cause cracking and delamination , the same effect responsible for " popcorning " damage on wet packaging of electronic parts . Careful baking of the substrates may be required .
The greater advances of the Soviet space program at the time allowed their space program to achieve other significant firsts , including the first EVA " spacewalk " and the first mission performed by a crew in shirt-sleeves . Gemini took a year longer than planned to accomplish its first flight , allowing the Soviets to achieve another first , launching Voskhod 1 on October 12 , 1964 , the first spacecraft with a three-cosmonaut crew . The USSR touted another technological achievement during this mission : it was the first space flight during which cosmonauts performed in a shirt-sleeve-environment . However , flying without spacesuits was not due to safety improvements in the Soviet spacecraft 's environmental systems ; rather this innovation was accomplished because the craft 's limited cabin space did not allow for spacesuits . Flying without spacesuits exposed the cosmonauts to significant risk in the event of potentially fatal cabin depressurization . This feat would not be repeated until the US Apollo Command Module flew in 1968 ; this later mission was designed from the outset to safely transport three astronauts in a shirt-sleeve environment while in space .
Everton were founder members of the Premier League in 1992 , but struggled to find the right manager . Howard Kendall had returned in 1990 but could not repeat his previous success , while his successor , Mike Walker , was statistically the least successful Everton manager to date . When former Everton player Joe Royle took over in 1994 the club 's form started to improve ; his first game in charge was a 2–0 victory over derby rivals Liverpool . Royle dragged Everton clear of relegation , leading the club to the FA Cup for the fifth time in its history , defeating Manchester United 1–0 in the final .
From the years 1500 to 1850 , an estimated 3.5 million captives were forcibly shipped from West/Central Africa to Brazil ; the territory received the highest number of slaves of any country in the Americas . Scholars estimate that more than half of the Brazilian population is at least in part descended from these individuals . Brazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants outside of Africa . In contrast to the US , during the slavery period and after , the Portuguese colonial government and later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti-miscegenation or segregation laws . As in other Latin countries , intermarriage was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward . In addition , people of mixed race ( pardo ) often tended to marry white , and their descendants became accepted as white . As a result , some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood . According to the last census of the 20th century , in which Brazilians could choose from five color/ethnic categories with which they identified , 54 % of individuals identified as white , 6.2 % identified as black , and 39.5 % identified as pardo ( brown ) — a broad multi-racial category , including tri-racial persons .
In 1870 , following the stunning defeat of the French Army by the Germans in the Franco-Prussian War , French workers and socialist revolutionaries seized Paris and created the Paris Commune . The Commune lasted for two months before it was crushed by the French Army , with much bloodshed . The original red banners of the Commune became icons of the socialist revolution ; in 1921 members of the French Communist Party came to Moscow and presented the new Soviet government with one of the original Commune banners ; it was placed ( and is still in place ) in the tomb of Vladimir Lenin , next to his open coffin .
To clean up pollution , the federal and local governments implemented numerous plans including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions , such as ozone and nitrogen oxides . When the levels of these two pollutants reached critical levels , contingency actions were implemented which included closing factories , changing school hours , and extending the A day without a car program to two days of the week . The government also instituted industrial technology improvements , a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and diesel fuels . The introduction of Metrobús bus rapid transit and the Ecobici bike-sharing were among efforts to encourage alternate , greener forms of transportation .
Major outputs for the state include textiles , cotton , cattle , and electrical power . Tennessee has over 82,000 farms , roughly 59 percent of which accommodate beef cattle . Although cotton was an early crop in Tennessee , large-scale cultivation of the fiber did not begin until the 1820s with the opening of the land between the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers . The upper wedge of the Mississippi Delta extends into southwestern Tennessee , and it was in this fertile section that cotton took hold . Soybeans are also heavily planted in West Tennessee , focusing on the northwest corner of the state .
As the Kulluk oil rig was being towed to the American state of Washington to be serviced in preparation for the 2013 drilling season , a winter storm on 27 December 2012 caused the towing crews , as well as the rescue service , to lose control of the situation . As of 1 January 2013 , the Kulluk was grounded off the coast Sitkalidak Island , near the eastern end of Kodiak Island . Following the accident , a Fortune magazine contacted Larry McKinney , the executive director at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A & M , and he explained that " A two-month delay in the Arctic is not a two-month delay ... A two-month delay could wipe out the entire drilling season . "
In 1966 an agreement with the Vatican , fostered in part by the death in 1960 of anti-communist archbishop of Zagreb Aloysius Stepinac and shifts in the church 's approach to resisting communism originating in the Second Vatican Council , accorded new freedom to the Yugoslav Roman Catholic Church , particularly to catechize and open seminaries . The agreement also eased tensions , which had prevented the naming of new bishops in Yugoslavia since 1945 . Tito 's new socialism met opposition from traditional communists culminating in conspiracy headed by Aleksandar Ranković . In the same year Tito declared that Communists must henceforth chart Yugoslavia 's course by the force of their arguments ( implying an abandonment of Leninist orthodoxy and development of liberal Communism ) . The State Security Administration ( UDBA ) saw its power scaled back and its staff reduced to 5000 .
Approximately 12 million Africans were shipped to the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade from 1492 to 1888 , with 11.5 million of those shipped to South America and the Caribbean . Brazil was the largest importer in the Americas , with 5.5 million African slaves imported , followed by the British Caribbean with 2.76 million , the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland with 1.59 million Africans , and the French Caribbean with 1.32 million . Today their descendants number approximately 150 million in South America and the Caribbean . In addition to skin color , other physical characteristics such as facial features and hair texture are often variously used in classifying peoples as black in South America and the Caribbean . In South America and the Caribbean , classification as black is also closely tied to social status and socioeconomic variables , especially in light of social conceptions of " blanqueamiento " ( racial whitening ) and related concepts .
Originally , legislative power was exercised by the sovereign acting on the advice of the Curia Regis , or Royal Council , in which important magnates and clerics participated and which evolved into parliament . The so-called Model Parliament included bishops , abbots , earls , barons , and two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough among its members . In 1265 , the Earl of Leicester irregularly called a full parliament without royal authorisation . The body eventually came to be divided into two branches : bishops , abbots , earls , and barons formed the House of Lords , while the shire and borough representatives formed the House of Commons . The King would seek the advice and consent of both houses before making any law . During Henry VI 's reign , it became regular practice for the two houses to originate legislation in the form of bills , which would not become law unless the sovereign 's assent was obtained , as the sovereign was , and still remains , the enactor of laws . Hence , all acts include the clause " Be it enacted by the Queen 's ( King 's ) most Excellent Majesty , by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal , and Commons , in this present Parliament assembled , and by the authority of the same , as follows ... " . The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 provide a second potential preamble if the House of Lords were to be excluded from the process .
ASCII itself was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for American Telephone & Telegraph 's TWX ( TeletypeWriter eXchange ) network . TWX originally used the earlier five-bit ITA2 , which was also used by the competing Telex teleprinter system . Bob Bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence . His British colleague Hugh McGregor Ross helped to popularize this work – according to Bemer , " so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the Bemer-Ross Code in Europe " . Because of his extensive work on ASCII , Bemer has been called " the father of ASCII . "
The original services of an inn are now also available at other establishments , such as hotels , lodges , and motels , which focus more on lodging customers than on other services , although they usually provide meals ; pubs , which are primarily alcohol-serving establishments ; and restaurants and taverns , which serve food and drink . In North America , the lodging aspect of the word " inn " lives on in hotel brand names like Holiday Inn , and in some state laws that refer to lodging operators as innkeepers .
The use of diversionary techniques such as fires had to be made carefully . The fake fires could only begin when the bombing started over an adjacent target and its effects were brought under control . Too early and the chances of success receded ; too late and the real conflagration at the target would exceed the diversionary fires . Another innovation was the boiler fire . These units were fed from two adjacent tanks containing oil and water . The oil-fed fires were then injected with water from time to time ; the flashes produced were similar to those of the German C-250 and C-500 Flammbomben . The hope was that , if it could deceive German bombardiers , it would draw more bombers away from the real target .
The Greeks of classical antiquity idealized their Mycenaean ancestors and the Mycenaean period as a glorious era of heroes , closeness of the gods and material wealth . The Homeric Epics ( i.e . Iliad and Odyssey ) were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer 's historicity . As part of the Mycenaean heritage that survived , the names of the gods and goddesses of Mycenaean Greece ( e.g . Zeus , Poseidon and Hades ) became major figures of the Olympian Pantheon of later antiquity .
Queen 's last album featuring Mercury , titled Made in Heaven , was finally released in 1995 , four years after his death . Featuring tracks such as " Too Much Love Will Kill You " and " Heaven for Everyone " , it was constructed from Mercury 's final recordings in 1991 , material left over from their previous studio albums and re-worked material from May , Taylor , and Mercury 's solo albums . The album also featured the song " Mother Love " , the last vocal recording Mercury made prior to his death , which he completed using a drum machine , over which May , Taylor and Deacon later added the instrumental track . After completing the penultimate verse , Mercury had told the band he " was n't feeling that great " and stated , " I will finish it when I come back , next time " ; however , he never made it back into the studio , so May later recorded the final verse of the song . Both stages of recording , before and after Mercury 's death , were completed at the band 's studio in Montreux , Switzerland . The album reached No . 1 on the UK charts immediately following its release , and has sold 20 million copies worldwide . On 25 November 1996 , a statue of Mercury was unveiled in Montreux overlooking Lake Geneva , almost five years to the day since his death .
The Inns of Court and Inns of Chancery in London started as ordinary inns where barristers met to do business , but became institutions of the legal profession in England and Wales .
During this period , the Russian Black Sea Fleet was operating against Ottoman coastal traffic between Constantinople ( currently named Istanbul ) and the Caucasus ports , while the Ottoman fleet sought to protect this supply line . The clash came on 30 November 1853 when a Russian fleet attacked an Ottoman force in the harbour at Sinop , and destroyed it at the Battle of Sinop . The battle outraged opinion in UK , which called for war . There was little additional naval action until March 1854 when on the declaration of war the British frigate Furious was fired on outside Odessa harbour . In response an Anglo-French fleet bombarded the port , causing much damage to the town . To show support for Turkey after the battle of Sinop , on the 22th of December 1853 , the Anglo-French squadron entered the Black Sea and the steamship HMS Retribution approached the Port of Sevastopol , the commander of which received an ultimatum not to allow any ships in the Black Sea .
International pressure led to a ceasefire , and by then 37 % of the island had been taken over by the Turks and 180,000 Greek Cypriots had been evicted from their homes in the north . At the same time , around 50,000 Turkish Cypriots moved to the areas under the control of the Turkish Forces and settled in the properties of the displaced Greek Cypriots . Among a variety of sanctions against Turkey , in mid-1975 the US Congress imposed an arms embargo on Turkey for using American-supplied equipment during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 . There are 1,534 Greek Cypriots and 502 Turkish Cypriots missing as a result of the fighting .
The troops were reembarked and moved to the Bay of St. Lunaire in Brittany where , on 3 September , they were landed to operate against St. Malo ; however , this action proved impractical . Worsening weather forced the two armies to separate : the ships sailed for the safer anchorage of St . Cast , while the army proceeded overland . The tardiness of Bligh in moving his forces allowed a French force of 10,000 from Brest to catch up with him and open fire on the reembarkation troops . A rear-guard of 1,400 under General Dury held off the French while the rest of the army embarked . They could not be saved ; 750 , including Dury , were killed and the rest captured .
Through its program of need-based financial aid , Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants . Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university , and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2017 was $ 46,395 . 15 % of Yale College students are expected to have no parental contribution , and about 50 % receive some form of financial aid . About 16 % of the Class of 2013 had some form of student loan debt at graduation , with an average debt of $ 13,000 among borrowers .
However , Eritrea still faces many challenges . Despite number of physicians increasing from only 0.2 in 1993 to 0.5 in 2004 per 1000 population , this is still very low . Malaria and tuberculosis are common in Eritrea . HIV prevalence among the 15–49 group exceeds 2 % . The fertility rate is at about 5 births per woman . Maternal mortality dropped by more than half from 1995 to 2002 , although the figure is still high . Similarly , between 1995 and 2002 , the number of births attended by skilled health personnel has doubled but still is only 28.3 % . A major cause of death in neonates is by severe infection . Per capita expenditure on health is low in Eritrea .
Maintaining continuity with his predecessors , John XXIII continued the gradual reform of the Roman liturgy , and published changes that resulted in the 1962 Roman Missal , the last typical edition containing the Tridentine Mass established in 1570 by Pope Pius V at the request of the Council of Trent and whose continued use Pope Benedict XVI authorized in 2007 , under the conditions indicated in his motu proprio Summorum Pontificum . In response to the directives of the Second Vatican Council , later editions of the Roman Missal present the 1970 form of the Roman Rite .
Buddhism began to spread throughout Japan during the Heian period , primarily through two major esoteric sects , Tendai and Shingon . Tendai originated in China and is based on the Lotus Sutra , one of the most important sutras of Mahayana Buddhism ; Saichō was key to its transmission to Japan . Shingon is the Japanese transmission of the Chinese Chen Yen school . Shingon , brought to Japan by the monk Kūkai , emphasizes Esoteric Buddhism . Both Kūkai and Saichō aimed to connect state and religion and establish support from the aristocracy , leading to the notion of 'aristocratic Buddhism ' . An important element of Tendai doctrine was the suggestion that enlightenment was accessible to " every creature " . Saichō also sought independent ordination for Tendai monks . A close relationship developed between the Tendai monastery complex on Mount Hiei and the imperial court in its new capital at the foot of the mountain . As a result , Tendai emphasized great reverence for the emperor and the nation . Kammu himself was a notable patron of the otherworldly Tendai sect , which rose to great power over the ensuing centuries . Kūkai greatly impressed the emperors who succeeded Emperor Kammu , and also generations of Japanese , not only with his holiness but also with his poetry , calligraphy , painting , and sculpture . Shingon , through its use of " rich symbols , rituals and mandalas " held a wide-ranging appeal .
A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994 , and a law on privatisation was adopted in 1997 , as well as a program of state property privatisation . Continued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management , including increasing revenue collection , improving the investment climate , and making strides against corruption . However , unemployment , which currently stands at around 15 % , still remains a major problem due to the influx of thousands of refugees from the Karabakh conflict .
Universal 's multi-year film financing deal with Elliott Management expired in 2013 . In July 2013 , Universal made an agreement with Legendary Pictures to market , co-finance , and distribute Legendary 's films for five years starting in 2014 , the year that Legendary 's similar agreement with Warner Bros. expires .
This season saw the first Idol Gives Back telethon-inspired event , which raised more than $ 76 million in corporate and viewer donations . No contestant was eliminated that week , but two ( Phil Stacey and Chris Richardson ) were eliminated the next . Melinda Doolittle was eliminated in the final three .
Alpine symbolism has played an essential role in shaping the history of the country and the Swiss national identity . Nowadays some concentrated mountain areas have a strong highly energetic ski resort culture in winter , and a hiking ( ger : das Wandern ) or Mountain biking culture in summer . Other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture that caters to tourism , yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors . A traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the cities . Folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country . In Switzerland it is mostly expressed in music , dance , poetry , wood carving and embroidery . The alphorn , a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood , has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of traditional Swiss music .
There were two distinct lines of Enlightenment thought : the radical enlightenment , inspired by the philosophy of Spinoza , advocating democracy , individual liberty , freedom of expression , and eradication of religious authority ; and a second , more moderate variety , supported by René Descartes , John Locke , Christian Wolff , Isaac Newton and others , which sought accommodation between reform and the traditional systems of power and faith . Both lines of thought were opposed by the conservative Counter-Enlightenment .
Secretory diarrhea means that there is an increase in the active secretion , or there is an inhibition of absorption . There is little to no structural damage . The most common cause of this type of diarrhea is a cholera toxin that stimulates the secretion of anions , especially chloride ions . Therefore , to maintain a charge balance in the lumen , sodium is carried with it , along with water . In this type of diarrhea intestinal fluid secretion is isotonic with plasma even during fasting . It continues even when there is no oral food intake .
Mainstream AC itself has evolved in a similar fashion over the years ; traditional AC artists like Barbra Streisand , the Carpenters , Dionne Warwick , Barry Manilow , John Denver , and Olivia Newton-John found it harder to have major Top 40 hits as the 1980s wore on , and due to the influence of MTV , artists who were staples of the Contemporary Hit Radio format , such as Richard Marx , Michael Jackson , Bonnie Tyler , George Michael , Phil Collins , and Laura Branigan began crossing over to the AC charts with greater frequency . Collins has been described by AllMusic as " one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond " . However , with the combination of MTV and AC radio , adult contemporary appeared harder to define as a genre , with established soft-rock artists of the past still charting pop hits and receiving airplay alongside mainstream radio fare from newer artists at the time .
As many as five bands were on tour during the 1920s . The Jenkins Orphanage Band played in the inaugural parades of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft and toured the USA and Europe . The band also played on Broadway for the play " Porgy " by DuBose and Dorothy Heyward , a stage version of their novel of the same title . The story was based in Charleston and featured the Gullah community . The Heywards insisted on hiring the real Jenkins Orphanage Band to portray themselves on stage . Only a few years later , DuBose Heyward collaborated with George and Ira Gershwin to turn his novel into the now famous opera , Porgy and Bess ( so named so as to distinguish it from the play ) . George Gershwin and Heyward spent the summer of 1934 at Folly Beach outside of Charleston writing this " folk opera " , as Gershwin called it . Porgy and Bess is considered the Great American Opera [ citation needed ] and is widely performed .
With regard to a safety net , Hayek advocated " some provision for those threatened by the extremes of indigence or starvation , be if only in the interest of those who require protection against acts of desperation on the part of the needy . " As referenced in the section on " The economic calculation problem , " Hayek wrote that " there is no reason why ... the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance . " Summarizing on this topic , Wapshott writes " [ Hayek ] advocated mandatory universal health care and unemployment insurance , enforced , if not directly provided , by the state . " Bernard Harcourt says that " Hayek was adamant about this . " In the 1973 Law , Legislation , and Liberty , Hayek wrote :
The First World War began in 1914 and lasted to the final Armistice in 1918 . The Allied Powers , led by the British Empire , France , Russia until March 1918 , Japan and the United States after 1917 , defeated the Central Powers , led by the German Empire , Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire . The war caused the disintegration of four empires—the Austro-Hungarian , German , Ottoman , and Russian ones—as well as radical change in the European and West Asian maps . The Allied powers before 1917 are referred to as the Triple Entente , and the Central Powers are referred to as the Triple Alliance .
While the new technique of polyphony was developing in the West , the Eastern Orthodox Church resisted any type of change . Therefore , Byzantine music remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment . As a result , and despite certain attempts by certain Greek chanters ( such as Manouel Gazis , Ioannis Plousiadinos or the Cypriot Ieronimos o Tragoudistis ) , Byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the West encouraged an unimpeded development of art . However , this method which kept music away from polyphony , along with centuries of continuous culture , enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection . Byzantium presented the monophonic Byzantine chant ; a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power .
The Bohr magneton and the nuclear magneton are units which are used to describe the magnetic properties of the electron and atomic nuclei respectively . The Bohr magneton is the magnetic moment which would be expected for an electron if it behaved as a spinning charge according to classical electrodynamics . It is defined in terms of the reduced Planck constant , the elementary charge and the electron mass , all of which depend on the Planck constant : the final dependence on h1/2 ( r2 > 0.995 ) can be found by expanding the variables .
In the 16th century , Count Hieronymus Schlick of Bohemia began minting coins known as Joachimstalers ( from German thal , or nowadays usually Tal , " valley " , cognate with " dale " in English ) , named for Joachimstal , the valley where the silver was mined ( St. Joachim 's Valley , now Jáchymov ; then part of the Kingdom of Bohemia , now part of the Czech Republic ) . Joachimstaler was later shortened to the German Taler , a word that eventually found its way into Danish and Swedish as daler , Norwegian as dalar and daler , Dutch as daler or daalder , Ethiopian as ታላሪ ( talari ) , Hungarian as tallér , Italian as tallero , and English as dollar . Alternatively , thaler is said to come from the German coin Guldengroschen ( " great guilder " , being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder ) , minted from the silver from Joachimsthal .
In 2003 , a congestion charge was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre . With a few exceptions , motorists are required to pay £10 per day to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London . Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass . London government initially expected the Congestion Charge Zone to increase daily peak period Underground and bus users by 20,000 people , reduce road traffic by 10 to 15 per cent , increase traffic speeds by 10 to 15 per cent , and reduce queues by 20 to 30 per cent . Over the course of several years , the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars – a 35-per-cent reduction of vehicles driven per day .
The Roman Republic ( Latin : Res publica Romana ; Classical Latin : [ ˈreːs ˈpuːb.lɪ.ka roːˈmaː.na ] ) was the period of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom , traditionally dated to 509 BC , and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire . It was during this period that Rome 's control expanded from the city 's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world . During the first two centuries of its existence , the Roman Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance , from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula . By the following century , it included North Africa , Spain , and what is now southern France . Two centuries after that , towards the end of the 1st century BC , it included the rest of modern France , Greece , and much of the eastern Mediterranean . By this time , internal tensions led to a series of civil wars , culminating with the assassination of Julius Caesar , which led to the transition from republic to empire . The exact date of transition can be a matter of interpretation . Historians have variously proposed Julius Caesar 's crossing of the Rubicon River in 49 BC , Caesar 's appointment as dictator for life in 44 BC , and the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . However , most use the same date as did the ancient Romans themselves , the Roman Senate 's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian and his adopting the title Augustus in 27 BC , as the defining event ending the Republic .
( The Ms 6.1 earthquake on August 30 , 2008 in southern Sichuan was not part of this series because it was caused by a different fault . See 2008 Panzhihua earthquake for details . )
In contrast to the Fed , the ECB normally does not buy bonds outright . The normal procedure used by the ECB for manipulating the money supply has been via the so-called refinancing facilities . In these facilities , bonds are not purchased but used in reverse transactions : repurchase agreements , or collateralised loans . These two transactions are similar , i.e . bonds are used as collaterals for loans , the difference being of legal nature . In the repos the ownership of the collateral changes to the ECB until the loan is repaid .
In the context of trademarks , this expansion has been driven by international efforts to harmonise the definition of " trademark " , as exemplified by the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ratified in 1994 , which formalized regulations for IP rights that had been handled by common law , or not at all , in member states . Pursuant to TRIPs , any sign which is " capable of distinguishing " the products or services of one business from the products or services of another business is capable of constituting a trademark .
The community of Casas Adobes is also on the Northwest Side , with the distinction of being Tucson 's first suburb , established in the late 1940s . Casas Adobes is centered on the historic Casas Adobes Plaza ( built in 1948 ) . Casas Adobes is also home to Tohono Chul Park ( a nature preserve ) near the intersection of North Oracle Road and West Ina Road . The attempted assassination of Representative Gabrielle Giffords , and the murders of chief judge for the U.S. District Court for Arizona , John Roll and five other people on January 8 , 2011 , occurred at the La Toscana Village in Casas Adobes . The Foothills Mall is also located on the northwest side in Casas Adobes .
New York City 's food culture includes a variety of international cuisines influenced by the city 's immigrant history . Central European and Italian immigrants originally made the city famous for bagels , cheesecake , and New York-style pizza , while Chinese and other Asian restaurants , sandwich joints , trattorias , diners , and coffeehouses have become ubiquitous . Some 4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city , many immigrant-owned , have made Middle Eastern foods such as falafel and kebabs popular examples of modern New York street food . The city is also home to nearly one thousand of the finest and most diverse haute cuisine restaurants in the world , according to Michelin . The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene assigns letter grades to the city 's 24,000 restaurants based upon their inspection results .
The city and surrounding area suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 attacks when 10 of the 19 terrorists associated with Al-Qaeda piloted American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and United Airlines Flight 175 into the South Tower of the World Trade Center , and later destroyed them , killing 2,192 civilians , 343 firefighters , and 71 law enforcement officers who were in the towers and in the surrounding area . The rebuilding of the area , has created a new One World Trade Center , and a 9/11 memorial and museum along with other new buildings and infrastructure . The World Trade Center PATH station , which opened on July 19 , 1909 as the Hudson Terminal , was also destroyed in the attack . A temporary station was built and opened on November 23 , 2003 . A permanent station , the World Trade Center Transportation Hub , is currently under construction . The new One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere and the fourth-tallest building in the world by pinnacle height , with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet ( 541.3 m ) in reference to the year of American independence .
Most graduate immunology schools follow the AAI courses immunology which are offered throughout numerous schools in the United States . For example , in New York State , there are several universities that offer the AAI courses immunology : Albany Medical College , Cornell University , Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai , New York University Langone Medical Center , University at Albany ( SUNY ) , University at Buffalo ( SUNY ) , University of Rochester Medical Center and Upstate Medical University ( SUNY ) . The AAI immunology courses include an Introductory Course and an Advance Course . The Introductory Course is a course that gives students an overview of the basics of immunology .
Air quality in Boston is generally very good : during the ten-year period 2004–2013 , there were only 4 days in which the air was unhealthy for the general public , according to the EPA .
The rise of Hitler and other dictators in the 1930s forced numerous Catholic intellectuals to flee Europe ; president John O'Hara brought many to Notre Dame . From Germany came Anton-Hermann Chroust ( 1907–1982 ) in classics and law , and Waldemar Gurian a German Catholic intellectual of Jewish descent . Positivism dominated American intellectual life in the 1920s onward but in marked contrast , Gurian received a German Catholic education and wrote his doctoral dissertation under Max Scheler . Ivan Meštrović ( 1883–1962 ) , a renowned sculptor , brought Croatian culture to campus , 1955–62 . Yves Simon ( 1903–61 ) , brought to ND in the 1940s the insights of French studies in the Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition of philosophy ; his own teacher Jacques Maritain ( 1882–73 ) was a frequent visitor to campus .
In the US , starting in 2013 , under the Physician Financial Transparency Reports ( part of the Sunshine Act ) , the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has to collect information from applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations in order to report information about their financial relationships with physicians and hospitals . Data are made public in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services website . The expectation is that relationship between doctors and Pharmaceutical industry will become fully transparent .
On 18 June 1948 , the National Security Council issued Directive 10/2 calling for covert action against the USSR , and granting the authority to carry out covert operations against " hostile foreign states or groups " that could , if needed , be denied by the U.S. government . To this end , the Office of Policy Coordination was created inside the new CIA . The OPC was quite unique ; Frank Wisner , the head of the OPC , answered not to the CIA Director , but to the secretaries of defense , state , and the NSC , and the OPC 's actions were a secret even from the head of the CIA . Most CIA stations had two station chiefs , one working for the OSO , and one working for the OPC .
Out of former Soviet Union republics Uzbekistan continued and expanded the program of child labour on industrial scale to increase profits on the main source of Islam Karimov 's income , cotton harvesting . In September , when school normally starts , the classes are suspended and children are sent to cotton fields for work , where they are assigned daily quotas of 20 to 60 kg of raw cotton they have to collect . This process is repeated in spring , when collected cotton needs to be hoed and weeded . In 2006 it is estimated that 2.7 million children were forced to work this way .
The Longwood Medical and Academic Area , adjacent to the Fenway district , is home to a large number of medical and research facilities , including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , Brigham and Women 's Hospital , Children 's Hospital Boston , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Harvard Medical School , Joslin Diabetes Center , and the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences .

The city has Veterans Affairs medical centers in the Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury neighborhoods . The Boston Public Health Commission , an agency of the Massachusetts government , oversees health concerns for city residents . Boston EMS provides pre-hospital emergency medical services to residents and visitors .
In an effort to discourage Japanese militarism , Western powers including Australia , the United States , Britain , and the Dutch government in exile , which controlled the petroleum-rich Dutch East Indies , stopped selling oil , iron ore , and steel to Japan , denying it the raw materials needed to continue its activities in China and French Indochina . In Japan , the government and nationalists viewed these embargos as acts of aggression ; imported oil made up about 80 % of domestic consumption , without which Japan 's economy , let alone its military , would grind to a halt . The Japanese media , influenced by military propagandists , [ nb 10 ] began to refer to the embargoes as the " ABCD ( " American-British-Chinese-Dutch " ) encirclement " or " ABCD line " .
In the early 1970s , Universal teamed up with Paramount Pictures to form Cinema International Corporation , which distributed films by Paramount and Universal worldwide . Though Universal did produce occasional hits , among them Airport ( 1970 ) , The Sting ( 1973 ) , American Graffiti ( also 1973 ) , Earthquake ( 1974 ) , and a big box-office success which restored the company 's fortunes : Jaws ( 1975 ) , Universal during the decade was primarily a television studio . When Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer purchased United Artists in 1981 , MGM could not drop out of the CIC venture to merge with United Artists overseas operations . However , with future film productions from both names being released through the MGM/UA Entertainment plate , CIC decided to merge UA 's international units with MGM and reformed as United International Pictures . There would be other film hits like E.T . the Extra-Terrestrial ( 1982 ) , Back to the Future ( 1985 ) , Field of Dreams ( 1989 ) , and Jurassic Park ( 1993 ) , but the film business was financially unpredictable . UIP began distributing films by start-up studio DreamWorks in 1997 , due to connections the founders have with Paramount , Universal , and Amblin Entertainment . In 2001 , MGM dropped out of the UIP venture , and went with 20th Century Fox 's international arm to handle distribution of their titles to this day .
The use of the word " heresy " was given wide currency by Irenaeus in his 2nd century tract Contra Haereses ( Against Heresies ) to describe and discredit his opponents during the early centuries of the Christian community . [ citation needed ] He described the community 's beliefs and doctrines as orthodox ( from ὀρθός , orthos " straight " + δόξα , doxa " belief " ) and the Gnostics ' teachings as heretical . [ citation needed ] He also pointed out the concept of apostolic succession to support his arguments .
Bern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars , when it was stripped of parts of its territories . It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802 , and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814 , it newly acquired the Bernese Jura . At this time , it once again became the largest canton of the confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979 . Bern was made the Federal City ( seat of the Federal Assembly ) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848 .
University education includes teaching , research , and social services activities , and it includes both the undergraduate level ( sometimes referred to as tertiary education ) and the graduate ( or postgraduate ) level ( sometimes referred to as graduate school ) . Universities are generally composed of several colleges . In the United States , universities can be private and independent like Yale University ; public and state-governed like the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education ; or independent but state-funded like the University of Virginia . A number of career specific courses are now available to students through the Internet .
On 25 and 26 April , May and Taylor appeared on the eleventh series of American Idol at the Nokia Theatre , Los Angeles , performing a Queen medley with the six finalists on the first show , and the following day performed " Somebody to Love " with the 'Queen Extravaganza ' band . Queen were scheduled to headline Sonisphere at Knebworth on 7 July 2012 with Adam Lambert before the festival was cancelled . Queen 's final concert with Freddie Mercury was in Knebworth in 1986 . Brian May commented , " It 's a worthy challenge for us , and I 'm sure Adam would meet with Freddie 's approval . " Queen expressed disappointment at the cancellation and released a statement to the effect that they were looking to find another venue . It was later announced that Queen + Adam Lambert would play two shows at the Hammersmith Apollo , London on 11 and 12 July 2012 . Both shows sold out within 24 hours of tickets going on open sale . A third London date was scheduled for 14 July . On 30 June , Queen + Lambert performed in Kiev , Ukraine at a joint concert with Elton John for the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation . Queen also performed with Lambert on 3 July 2012 at Moscow 's Olympic Stadium , and on 7 July 2012 at the Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw , Poland .
Florida is served by Amtrak , operating numerous lines throughout , connecting the state 's largest cities to points north in the United States and Canada . The busiest Amtrak train stations in Florida in 2011 were : Sanford ( 259,944 ) , Orlando ( 179,142 ) , Tampa Union Station ( 140,785 ) , Miami ( 94,556 ) , and Jacksonville ( 74,733 ) .

Florida is served by two additional Amtrak trains ( the Silver Star and the Silver Meteor ) , which operate between New York City and Miami . Miami Central Station , the city 's rapid transit , commuter rail , intercity rail , and bus hub , is under construction .
The Russian SFSR was controlled by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , until the abortive 1991 August coup , which prompted President Yeltsin to suspend the recently created Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic .
The Café Procope was established in Paris in 1686 ; by the 1720s there were around 400 cafés in the city . The Café Procope in particular became a center of Enlightenment , welcoming such celebrities as Voltaire and Rousseau . The Café Procope was where Diderot and D'Alembert decided to create the Encyclopédie . The cafés were one of the various " nerve centers " for bruits publics , public noise or rumour . These bruits were allegedly a much better source of information than were the actual newspapers available at the time .
Due to insistence by the International Federation of Association Football ( FIFA ) , the international governing body of football , that domestic leagues reduce the number of games clubs played , the number of clubs was reduced to 20 in 1995 when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted . On 8 June 2006 , FIFA requested that all major European leagues , including Italy 's Serie A and Spain 's La Liga be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007–08 season . The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction . Ultimately , the 2007–08 season kicked off again with 20 teams .
The fighter aircraft of the USAF are small , fast , and maneuverable military aircraft primarily used for air-to-air combat . Many of these fighters have secondary ground-attack capabilities , and some are dual-roled as fighter-bombers ( e.g. , the F-16 Fighting Falcon ) ; the term " fighter " is also sometimes used colloquially for dedicated ground-attack aircraft . Other missions include interception of bombers and other fighters , reconnaissance , and patrol . The F-16 is currently used by the USAF Air Demonstration squadron , the Thunderbirds , while a small number of both man-rated and non-man-rated F-4 Phantom II are retained as QF-4 aircraft for use as Full Scale Aerial Targets ( FSAT ) or as part of the USAF Heritage Flight program . These extant QF-4 aircraft are being replaced in the FSAT role by early model F-16 aircraft converted to QF-16 configuration . The USAF has 2,025 fighters in service as of September 2012 .
Congo-Brazzaville has had a multi-party political system since the early 1990s , although the system is heavily dominated by President Denis Sassou Nguesso ; he has lacked serious competition in the presidential elections held under his rule . Sassou Nguesso is backed by his own Congolese Labour Party ( French : Parti Congolais du Travail ) as well as a range of smaller parties .
Reporters in Chengdu said they saw cracks on walls of some residential buildings in the downtown areas , but no buildings collapsed . Many Beijing office towers were evacuated , including the building housing the media offices for the organizers of the 2008 Summer Olympics . None of the Olympic venues were damaged . Meanwhile , a cargo train carrying 13 petrol tanks derailed in Hui County , Gansu , and caught on fire after the rail was distorted .
Under Article IV , Section Three of the United States Constitution , which outlines the relationship among the states , Congress has the power to admit new states to the union . The states are required to give " full faith and credit " to the acts of each other 's legislatures and courts , which is generally held to include the recognition of legal contracts , marriages , and criminal judgments . The states are guaranteed military and civil defense by the federal government , which is also obliged by Article IV , Section Four , to " guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government " .
Large scale climatic changes , as have been experienced in the past , are expected to have an effect on the timing of migration . Studies have shown a variety of effects including timing changes in migration , breeding as well as population variations .
Strasbourg 's status as a free city was revoked by the French Revolution . Enragés , most notoriously Eulogius Schneider , ruled the city with an increasingly iron hand . During this time , many churches and monasteries were either destroyed or severely damaged . The cathedral lost hundreds of its statues ( later replaced by copies in the 19th century ) and in April 1794 , there was talk of tearing its spire down , on the grounds that it was against the principle of equality . The tower was saved , however , when in May of the same year citizens of Strasbourg crowned it with a giant tin Phrygian cap . This artifact was later kept in the historical collections of the city until it was destroyed by the Germans in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian war .
Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth 's land surface , oceans – which cover about 71 % of the globe – and atmosphere . Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises , causing atmospheric circulation or convection . When the air reaches a high altitude , where the temperature is low , water vapor condenses into clouds , which rain onto the Earth 's surface , completing the water cycle . The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection , producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind , cyclones and anti-cyclones . Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14 °C . By photosynthesis green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy , which produces food , wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived .
Sextus Julius Africanus further refers to the writings of historian Thallus : " This darkness Thallus , in the third book of his History , calls , as appears to me without reason , an eclipse of the sun . For the Hebrews celebrate the passover on the 14th day according to the moon , and the passion of our Saviour falls on the day before the passover ; but an eclipse of the sun takes place only when the moon comes under the sun . " Christian apologist Tertullian believed the event was documented in the Roman archives .
In the Low Middle Ages , Catalan went through a golden age , reaching a peak of maturity and cultural richness . Examples include the work of Majorcan polymath Ramon Llull ( 1232–1315 ) , the Four Great Chronicles ( 13th–14th centuries ) , and the Valencian school of poetry culminating in Ausiàs March ( 1397–1459 ) . By the 15th century , the city of Valencia had become the sociocultural center of the Crown of Aragon , and Catalan was present all over the Mediterranean world . During this period , the Royal Chancery propagated a highly standardized language . Catalan was widely used as an official language in Sicily until the 15th century , and in Sardinia until the 17th . During this period , the language was what Costa Carreras terms " one of the 'great languages ' of medieval Europe " .

Israel , and The US Air Force , in conjunction with the members of NATO , has developed significant tactics for air defence suppression . Dedicated weapons such as anti-radiation missiles and advanced electronics intelligence and electronic countermeasures platforms seek to suppress or negate the effectiveness of an opposing air-defence system . It is an arms race ; as better jamming , countermeasures and anti-radiation weapons are developed , so are better SAM systems with ECCM capabilities and the ability to shoot down anti-radiation missiles and other munitions aimed at them or the targets they are defending .
Dams remain the principal source of water both for domestic and agricultural use ; Cyprus has a total of 107 dams ( plus one currently under construction ) and reservoirs , with a total water storage capacity of about 330,000,000 m3 ( 1.2×1010 cu ft ) . Water desalination plants are gradually being constructed to deal with recent years of prolonged drought . The Government has invested heavily in the creation of water desalination plants which have supplied almost 50 per cent of domestic water since 2001 . Efforts have also been made to raise public awareness of the situation and to encourage domestic water users to take more responsibility for the conservation of this increasingly scarce commodity .
Traditionally the annelids have been divided into two major groups , the polychaetes and clitellates . In turn the clitellates were divided into oligochaetes , which include earthworms , and hirudinomorphs , whose best-known members are leeches . For many years there was no clear arrangement of the approximately 80 polychaete families into higher-level groups . In 1997 Greg Rouse and Kristian Fauchald attempted a " first heuristic step in terms of bringing polychaete systematics to an acceptable level of rigour " , based on anatomical structures , and divided polychaetes into :
Plymouth City Council is responsible for waste management throughout the city and South West Water is responsible for sewerage . Plymouth 's electricity is supplied from the National Grid and distributed to Plymouth via Western Power Distribution . On the outskirts of Plympton a combined cycle gas-powered station , the Langage Power Station , which started to produce electricity for Plymouth at the end of 2009 .
Samkhya philosophy includes a theory of gunas ( qualities , innate tendencies , psyche ) . Guna , it states , are of three types : Sattva being good , compassionate , illuminating , positive , and constructive ; Rajas guna is one of activity , chaotic , passion , impulsive , potentially good or bad ; and Tamas being the quality of darkness , ignorance , destructive , lethargic , negative . Everything , all life forms and human beings , state Samkhya scholars , have these three gunas , but in different proportions . The interplay of these gunas defines the character of someone or something , of nature and determines the progress of life . Samkhya theorises a pluralism of souls ( Jeevatmas ) who possess consciousness , but denies the existence of Ishvara ( God ) . Classical Samkhya is considered an atheist / non-theistic Hindu philosophy .

In France , the established men of letters ( gens de lettres ) had fused with the elites ( les grands ) of French society by the mid-18th century . This led to the creation of an oppositional literary sphere , Grub Street , the domain of a " multitude of versifiers and would-be authors " . These men came to London to become authors , only to discover that the literary market simply could not support large numbers of writers , who , in any case , were very poorly remunerated by the publishing-bookselling guilds .
Motor systems are areas of the brain that are directly or indirectly involved in producing body movements , that is , in activating muscles . Except for the muscles that control the eye , which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain , all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain . Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord , and by inputs that descend from the brain . The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses , and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming . The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control .
J. Edgar Hoover served as Director from 1924 to 1972 , a combined 48 years with the BOI , DOI , and FBI . He was chiefly responsible for creating the Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory , or the FBI Laboratory , which officially opened in 1932 , as part of his work to professionalize investigations by the government . Hoover was substantially involved in most major cases and projects that the FBI handled during his tenure . After Hoover 's death , Congress passed legislation that limited the tenure of future FBI Directors to ten years .
In the early 20th century , the vast conscription of Italian men from all throughout Italy during World War I is credited with facilitating the diffusion of standard Italian among less educated Italian men , as these men from various regions with various regional languages were forced to communicate with each other in a common tongue while serving in the Italian military . With the eventual spread of the radio and television throughout Italy and the establishment of public education , Italians from all regions were increasingly exposed to standard Italian , while literacy rates among all social classes improved . Today , the majority of Italians are able to speak standard Italian , though many Italians still speak their regional language regularly or as their primary day-to-day language , especially at home with family or when communicating with Italians from the same town or region . However , to some Italians , speaking a regional language , especially in a formal setting or outside of one 's region , may carry a stigma or negative connotations associated with being lower class , uneducated , boorish , or overly informal .
Originally alphabets were written entirely in majuscule letters , spaced between well-defined upper and lower bounds . When written quickly with a pen , these tended to turn into rounder and much simpler forms . It is from these that the first minuscule hands developed , the half-uncials and cursive minuscule , which no longer stayed bound between a pair of lines . These in turn formed the foundations for the Carolingian minuscule script , developed by Alcuin for use in the court of Charlemagne , which quickly spread across Europe . The advantage of the minuscule over majuscule was improved , faster readability . [ citation needed ]
The Ministry of Defence is one of the United Kingdom 's largest landowners , owning 227,300 hectares of land and foreshore ( either freehold or leasehold ) at April 2014 , which was valued at " about £20 billion " . The MoD also has " rights of access " to a further 222,000 hectares . In total , this is about 1.8 % of the UK land mass . The total annual cost to support the defence estate is " in excess of £3.3 billion " .
Gaddafi briefly studied History at the University of Libya in Benghazi , before dropping out to join the military . Despite his police record , in 1963 he began training at the Royal Military Academy , Benghazi , alongside several like-minded friends from Misrata . The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged Libyans , and Gaddafi recognised it as a potential instrument of political change . Under Idris , Libya 's armed forces were trained by the British military ; this angered Gaddafi , who viewed the British as imperialists , and accordingly he refused to learn English and was rude to the British officers , ultimately failing his exams . British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour , stating their suspicion that he was involved in the assassination of the military academy 's commander in 1963 . Such reports were ignored and Gaddafi quickly progressed through the course .
Instead , the monarch directly grants royal assent by Order in Council . Assent is granted or refused on the advice of the Lord Chancellor . A recent example when assent was refused ( or , more correctly , when the Lord Chancellor declined to present the law for assent ) was in 2007 , concerning reforms to the constitution of the Chief Pleas of Sark . ( A revised version of the proposed reforms was subsequently given assent . ) In 2011 , campaigners against a law that sought to reduce the number of senators in the states of Jersey petitioned the Privy Council to advise the Queen to refuse royal assent . An Order in Council of 13 July 2011 established new rules for the consideration of petitions against granting royal assent .
Other researchers point out that finding a difference in disease prevalence between two socially defined groups does not necessarily imply genetic causation of the difference . They suggest that medical practices should maintain their focus on the individual rather than an individual 's membership to any group . They argue that overemphasizing genetic contributions to health disparities carries various risks such as reinforcing stereotypes , promoting racism or ignoring the contribution of non-genetic factors to health disparities . International epidemiological data show that living conditions rather than race make the biggest difference in health outcomes even for diseases that have " race-specific " treatments . Some studies have found that patients are reluctant to accept racial categorization in medical practice .
UNFPA provided aid to Peru 's reproductive health program in the mid-to-late '90s . When it was discovered a Peruvian program had been engaged in carrying out coercive sterilizations , UNFPA called for reforms and protocols to protect the rights of women seeking assistance . UNFPA was not involved in the scandal , but continued work with the country after the abuses had become public to help end the abuses and reform laws and practices .
On Dell and Toshiba laptops , the port is marked with the standard USB symbol with an added lightning bolt icon on the right side . Dell calls this feature PowerShare , while Toshiba calls it USB Sleep-and-Charge . On Acer Inc. and Packard Bell laptops , sleep-and-charge USB ports are marked with a non-standard symbol ( the letters USB over a drawing of a battery ) ; the feature is simply called Power-off USB . On some laptops such as Dell and Apple MacBook models , it is possible to plug a device in , close the laptop ( putting it into sleep mode ) and have the device continue to charge .

Until the 1950s guns firing ballistic munitions were the standard weapon ; guided missiles then became dominant , except at the very shortest ranges . However , the type of shell or warhead and its fuzing and , with missiles the guidance arrangement , were and are varied . Targets are not always easy to destroy ; nonetheless , damaged aircraft may be forced to abort their mission and , even if they manage to return and land in friendly territory , may be out of action for days or permanently . Ignoring small arms and smaller machine-guns , ground-based air defence guns have varied in calibre from 20 mm to at least 150 mm .
The first streetcars appeared in 1889 and were instrumental in the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines . The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell for rail in Seattle . Tacoma–Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett–Seattle service came to an end in 1939 , replaced by inexpensive automobiles running on the recently developed highway system . Rails on city streets were paved over or removed , and the opening of the Seattle trolleybus system brought the end of streetcars in Seattle in 1941 . This left an extensive network of privately owned buses ( later public ) as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region .
In Japan , 14 August is considered to be the day that the Pacific War ended . However , as Imperial Japan actually surrendered on 15 August , this day became known in the English-speaking countries as " V-J Day " ( Victory in Japan ) . The formal Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed on 2 September 1945 , on the battleship USS Missouri , in Tokyo Bay . The surrender was accepted by General Douglas MacArthur as Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers , with representatives of several Allied nations , from a Japanese delegation led by Mamoru Shigemitsu and Yoshijiro Umezu .
The Multidimensional Pain Inventory ( MPI ) is a questionnaire designed to assess the psychosocial state of a person with chronic pain . Analysis of MPI results by Turk and Rudy ( 1988 ) found three classes of chronic pain patient : " ( a ) dysfunctional , people who perceived the severity of their pain to be high , reported that pain interfered with much of their lives , reported a higher degree of psychological distress caused by pain , and reported low levels of activity ; ( b ) interpersonally distressed , people with a common perception that significant others were not very supportive of their pain problems ; and ( c ) adaptive copers , patients who reported high levels of social support , relatively low levels of pain and perceived interference , and relatively high levels of activity . " Combining the MPI characterization of the person with their IASP five-category pain profile is recommended for deriving the most useful case description .
In 1756 and 1757 the French captured forts Oswego and William Henry from the British . The latter victory was marred when France 's native allies broke the terms of capitulation and attacked the retreating British column , which was under French guard , slaughtering and scalping soldiers and taking captive many men , women and children while the French refused to protect their captives . French naval deployments in 1757 also successfully defended the key Fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island , securing the seaward approaches to Quebec .
Interactions between alcohol and certain antibiotics may occur and may cause side-effects and decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy . While moderate alcohol consumption is unlikely to interfere with many common antibiotics , there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol consumption may cause serious side-effects . Therefore , potential risks of side-effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibiotic administered . Despite the lack of a categorical counterindication , the belief that alcohol and antibiotics should never be mixed is widespread .
When the Xbox 360 was released , Microsoft 's online gaming service Xbox Live was shut down for 24 hours and underwent a major upgrade , adding a basic non-subscription service called Xbox Live Silver ( later renamed Xbox Live Free ) to its already established premium subscription-based service ( which was renamed Gold ) . Xbox Live Free is included with all SKUs of the console . It allows users to create a user profile , join on message boards , and access Microsoft 's Xbox Live Arcade and Marketplace and talk to other members . A Live Free account does not generally support multiplayer gaming ; however , some games that have rather limited online functions already , ( such as Viva Piñata ) or games that feature their own subscription service ( e.g . EA Sports games ) can be played with a Free account . Xbox Live also supports voice the latter a feature possible with the Xbox Live Vision .
Although there were a number of department stores in Australia for much of the 20th Century , including chains such as Grace Bros. and Waltons , many disappeared during the 1980s and 1990s . Today Myer and David Jones , located nationally , are practically the national department stores duopoly in Australia . When Russian-born migrant , Sidney Myer , came to Australia in 1899 he formed the Myer retail group with his brother , Elcon Myer . In 1900 , they opened the first Myer department store , in Bendigo , Victoria . Since then , the Myer retail group has grown to be Australia 's largest retailer . Both , Myer and David Jones , are up-market chains , offering a wide variety of products from mid-range names to luxury brands . Other retail chain stores such as Target ( unrelated to the American chain of the same name ) , Venture ( now defunct ) , Kmart and Big W , also located nationally , are considered to be Australia 's discount department stores . Harris Scarfe , though only operating in four states and one territory , is a department store using both the large full-line and small discount department store formats . Most department stores in Australia have their own credit card companies , each having their own benefits while the discount department stores do not have their own credit card rights .
An upgrade to Windows 8 known as Windows 8.1 was officially announced by Microsoft on May 14 , 2013 . Following a presentation devoted to the upgrade at Build 2013 , a public beta version of the upgrade was released on June 26 , 2013 . Windows 8.1 was released to OEM hardware partners on August 27 , 2013 , and released publicly as a free download through Windows Store on October 17 , 2013 . Volume license customers and subscribers to MSDN Plus and TechNet Plus were initially unable to obtain the RTM version upon its release ; a spokesperson said the policy was changed to allow Microsoft to work with OEMs " to ensure a quality experience at general availability . " However , after criticism , Microsoft reversed its decision and released the RTM build on MSDN and TechNet on September 9 , 2013 .
The Cork School of Music and the Crawford College of Art and Design provide a throughput of new blood , as do the active theatre components of several courses at University College Cork ( UCC ) .

Hokkien dialects are typically written using Chinese characters ( 漢字 , Hàn-jī ) . However , the written script was and remains adapted to the literary form , which is based on classical Chinese , not the vernacular and spoken form . Furthermore , the character inventory used for Mandarin ( standard written Chinese ) does not correspond to Hokkien words , and there are a large number of informal characters ( 替字 , thè-jī or thòe-jī ; 'substitute characters ' ) which are unique to Hokkien ( as is the case with Cantonese ) . For instance , about 20 to 25 % of Taiwanese morphemes lack an appropriate or standard Chinese character .
Seattle is located between the saltwater Puget Sound ( an arm of the Pacific Ocean ) to the west and Lake Washington to the east . The city 's chief harbor , Elliott Bay , is part of Puget Sound , which makes the city an oceanic port . To the west , beyond Puget Sound , are the Kitsap Peninsula and Olympic Mountains on the Olympic Peninsula ; to the east , beyond Lake Washington and the eastside suburbs , are Lake Sammamish and the Cascade Range . Lake Washington 's waters flow to Puget Sound through the Lake Washington Ship Canal ( consisting of two man-made canals , Lake Union , and the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks at Salmon Bay , ending in Shilshole Bay on Puget Sound ) .
Under the Bretton Woods system established after World War II , the value of gold was fixed to $ 35 per ounce , and the value of the U.S. dollar was thus anchored to the value of gold . Rising government spending in the 1960s , however , led to doubts about the ability of the United States to maintain this convertibility , gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold , and as a result the value of the dollar began to decline . Facing an emerging currency crisis and the imminent danger that the United States would no longer be able to redeem dollars for gold , gold convertibility was finally terminated in 1971 by President Nixon , resulting in the " Nixon shock " .
The issue of the parentage of Jesus in the Talmud affects also the view of his mother . However the Talmud does not mention Mary by name and is considerate rather than only polemic . The story about Panthera is also found in the Toledot Yeshu , the literary origins of which can not be traced with any certainty and given that it is unlikely to go before the 4th century , it is far too late to include authentic remembrances of Jesus . The Blackwell Companion to Jesus states that the Toledot Yeshu has no historical facts as such , and was perhaps created as a tool for warding off conversions to Christianity . The name Panthera may be a distortion of the term parthenos ( virgin ) and Raymond E. Brown considers the story of Panthera a fanciful explanation of the birth of Jesus which includes very little historical evidence . Robert Van Voorst states that given that Toledot Yeshu is a medieval document and due to its lack of a fixed form and orientation towards a popular audience , it is " most unlikely " to have reliable historical information .
In 2003 Imperial was granted degree-awarding powers in its own right by the Privy Council . The London Centre for Nanotechnology was established in the same year as a joint venture between UCL and Imperial College London . In 2004 the Tanaka Business School ( now named the Imperial College Business School ) and a new Main Entrance on Exhibition Road were opened by The Queen . The UK Energy Research Centre was also established in 2004 and opened its headquarters at Imperial College . In November 2005 the Faculties of Life Sciences and Physical Sciences merged to become the Faculty of Natural Sciences .

Gene nomenclature has been established by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee ( HGNC ) for each known human gene in the form of an approved gene name and symbol ( short-form abbreviation ) , which can be accessed through a database maintained by HGNC . Symbols are chosen to be unique , and each gene has only one symbol ( although approved symbols sometimes change ) . Symbols are preferably kept consistent with other members of a gene family and with homologs in other species , particularly the mouse due to its role as a common model organism .
The southern Essonne department specialises in science and technology , and the south-eastern Val-de-Marne , with its wholesale Rungis food market , specialises in food processing and beverages . The Paris region 's manufacturing decline is quickly being replaced by eco-industries : these employ about 100,000 workers . In 2011 , while only 56,927 construction workers worked in Paris itself , its metropolitan area employed 246,639 , in an activity centred largely around the Seine-Saint-Denis ( 41,378 ) and Hauts-de-Seine ( 37,303 ) departments and the new business-park centres appearing there .
In the latter half of the 19th century the locale of South Kensington was developed as " Albertopolis " , a cultural and scientific quarter . Three major national museums are there : the Victoria and Albert Museum ( for the applied arts ) , the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum . The National Portrait Gallery was founded in 1856 to house depictions of figures from British history ; its holdings now comprise the world 's most extensive collection of portraits . The national gallery of British art is at Tate Britain , originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897 . The Tate Gallery , as it was formerly known , also became a major centre for modern art ; in 2000 this collection moved to Tate Modern , a new gallery housed in the former Bankside Power Station .
After Nasser died in November 1970 , his successor , Anwar Sadat , suggested that rather than a unified state , they create a political federation , implemented in April 1971 ; in doing so , Egypt , Syria and Sudan got large grants of Libyan oil money . In February 1972 , Gaddafi and Sadat signed an unofficial charter of merger , but it was never implemented as relations broke down the following year . Sadat became increasingly wary of Libya 's radical direction , and the September 1973 deadline for implementing the Federation passed by with no action taken .
The origin of Tom Robinson is less clear , although many have speculated that his character was inspired by several models . When Lee was 10 years old , a white woman near Monroeville accused a black man named Walter Lett of raping her . The story and the trial were covered by her father 's newspaper which reported that Lett was convicted and sentenced to death . After a series of letters appeared claiming Lett had been falsely accused , his sentence was commuted to life in prison . He died there of tuberculosis in 1937 . Scholars believe that Robinson 's difficulties reflect the notorious case of the Scottsboro Boys , in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence . However , in 2005 , Lee stated that she had in mind something less sensational , although the Scottsboro case served " the same purpose " to display Southern prejudices . Emmett Till , a black teenager who was murdered for flirting with a white woman in Mississippi in 1955 , and whose death is credited as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement , is also considered a model for Tom Robinson .
The story sees Bond pitted against the global criminal organisation Spectre , marking the group 's first appearance in an Eon Productions film since 1971 's Diamonds Are Forever , [ N 2 ] and tying Craig 's series of films together with an overarching storyline . Several recurring James Bond characters , including M , Q and Eve Moneypenny return , with the new additions of Léa Seydoux as Dr. Madeleine Swann , Dave Bautista as Mr. Hinx , Andrew Scott as Max Denbigh and Monica Bellucci as Lucia Sciarra .
Theism generally holds that God exists realistically , objectively , and independently of human thought ; that God created and sustains everything ; that God is omnipotent and eternal ; and that God is personal and interacting with the universe through , for example , religious experience and the prayers of humans . Theism holds that God is both transcendent and immanent ; thus , God is simultaneously infinite and in some way present in the affairs of the world . Not all theists subscribe to all of these propositions , but each usually subscribes to some of them ( see , by way of comparison , family resemblance ) . Catholic theology holds that God is infinitely simple and is not involuntarily subject to time . Most theists hold that God is omnipotent , omniscient , and benevolent , although this belief raises questions about God 's responsibility for evil and suffering in the world . Some theists ascribe to God a self-conscious or purposeful limiting of omnipotence , omniscience , or benevolence . Open Theism , by contrast , asserts that , due to the nature of time , God 's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future . Theism is sometimes used to refer in general to any belief in a god or gods , i.e. , monotheism or polytheism .
The Ottoman Islamic legal system was set up differently from traditional European courts . Presiding over Islamic courts would be a Qadi , or judge . Since the closing of the ijtihad , or Gate of Interpretation , Qadis throughout the Ottoman Empire focused less on legal precedent , and more with local customs and traditions in the areas that they administered . However , the Ottoman court system lacked an appellate structure , leading to jurisdictional case strategies where plaintiffs could take their disputes from one court system to another until they achieved a ruling that was in their favor .
Hot adult contemporary radio stations play a variety of classic hits and contemporary mainstream music aimed at an adult audience . Some Hot AC stations concentrate slightly more on pop music and alternative rock to target the Generation Z audience , though they include the more youth-oriented teen pop , urban and rhythmic dance tracks .
Camouflage is an important defense strategy , which involves the use of coloration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment . This sort of protective coloration is common and widespread among beetle families , especially those that feed on wood or vegetation , such as many of the leaf beetles ( family Chrysomelidae ) or weevils . In some of these species , sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects . Many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate . Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves , and the bodies of some species ( such as O. macklotti and Palophus centaurus ) are covered in mossy or lichenous outgrowths that supplement their disguise . Some species have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift ( B. scabrinota , T. californica ) . In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis , a number of species have been noted to perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side that is thought to reflect the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze . Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death ( catalepsy ) , where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period . The nocturnal feeding habits of adults also aids Phasmatodea in remaining concealed from predators .
Among predators there is a large degree of specialization . Many predators specialize in hunting only one species of prey . Others are more opportunistic and will kill and eat almost anything ( examples : humans , leopards , dogs and alligators ) . The specialists are usually particularly well suited to capturing their preferred prey . The prey in turn , are often equally suited to escape that predator . This is called an evolutionary arms race and tends to keep the populations of both species in equilibrium . Some predators specialize in certain classes of prey , not just single species . Some will switch to other prey ( with varying degrees of success ) when the preferred target is extremely scarce , and they may also resort to scavenging or a herbivorous diet if possible .

Throughout the second half of the 19th century , child labour began to decline in industrialised societies due to regulation and economic factors . The regulation of child labour began from the earliest days of the Industrial revolution . The first act to regulate child labour in Britain was passed in 1803 . As early as 1802 and 1819 Factory Acts were passed to regulate the working hours of workhouse children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day . These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation , by for example the " Short Time Committees " in 1831 , a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11–18 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day , children aged 9–11 a maximum of eight hours , and children under the age of nine were no longer permitted to work . This act however only applied to the textile industry , and further agitation led to another act in 1847 limiting both adults and children to 10-hour working days . Lord Shaftesbury was an outspoken advocate of regulating child labour .
The city has a sizable Jewish population with an estimated 25,000 Jews within the city and 227,000 within the Boston metro area ; the number of congregations in Boston is estimated at 22 . The adjacent communities of Brookline and Newton are both approximately one-third Jewish .
In November 2013 MGM and the McClory estate formally settled the issue with Danjaq , LLC—sister company of Eon Productions—with MGM acquiring the full copyright film rights to the concept of Spectre and all of the characters associated with it . With the acquisition of the film rights and the organisation 's re-introduction to the series ' continuity , the SPECTRE acronym was discarded and the organisation reimagined as " Spectre " .
Throughout its history , the city has been a major port of entry for immigrants into the United States ; more than 12 million European immigrants were received at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1924 . The term " melting pot " was first coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side . By 1900 , Germans constituted the largest immigrant group , followed by the Irish , Jews , and Italians . In 1940 , whites represented 92 % of the city 's population .
Anti-aircraft warfare or counter-air defence is defined by NATO as " all measures designed to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of hostile air action . " They include ground-and air-based weapon systems , associated sensor systems , command and control arrangements and passive measures ( e.g . barrage balloons ) . It may be used to protect naval , ground , and air forces in any location . However , for most countries the main effort has tended to be 'homeland defence ' . NATO refers to airborne air defence as counter-air and naval air defence as anti-aircraft warfare . Missile defence is an extension of air defence as are initiatives to adapt air defence to the task of intercepting any projectile in flight .
In Japan , the term kirishitan ( written in Edo period documents 吉利支丹 , 切支丹 , and in modern Japanese histories as キリシタン ) , from Portuguese cristão , referred to Roman Catholics in the 16th and 17th centuries before the religion was banned by the Tokugawa shogunate . Today , Christians are referred to in Standard Japanese as キリスト教徒 , Kirisuto-kyōto or the English-derived term クリスチャン kurisuchan .
In some countries anti-Masonry is often related to antisemitism and anti-Zionism . For example , In 1980 , the Iraqi legal and penal code was changed by Saddam Hussein 's ruling Ba'ath Party , making it a felony to " promote or acclaim Zionist principles , including Freemasonry , or who associate [ themselves ] with Zionist organisations " . Professor Andrew Prescott of the University of Sheffield writes : " Since at least the time of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion , antisemitism has gone hand in hand with anti-masonry , so it is not surprising that allegations that 11 September was a Zionist plot have been accompanied by suggestions that the attacks were inspired by a masonic world order " .
In terms of school casualties , thousands of school children died due to shoddy construction . In Mianyang City , seven schools collapsed , burying at least 1,700 people . At least 7,000 school buildings throughout the province collapsed . Another 700 students were buried in a school in Hanwang . At least 600 students and staff died at Juyuan Elementary School . Up to 1,300 children and teachers died at Beichuan Middle School .
Violent incidents occurred throughout the Piedmont of the state as white insurgents struggled to maintain white supremacy in the face of social changes after the war and granting of citizenship to freedmen by federal constitutional amendments . After former Confederates were allowed to vote again , election campaigns from 1872 on were marked by violent intimidation of blacks and Republicans by white Democratic paramilitary groups , known as the Red Shirts . Violent incidents took place in Charleston on King Street in September 6 and in nearby Cainhoy on October 15 , both in association with political meetings before the 1876 election . The Cainhoy incident was the only one statewide in which more whites were killed than blacks . The Red Shirts were instrumental in suppressing the black Republican vote in some areas in 1876 and narrowly electing Wade Hampton as governor , and taking back control of the state legislature . Another riot occurred in Charleston the day after the election , when a prominent Republican leader was mistakenly reported killed .
In 2001 , Lee was inducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor . In the same year , Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley initiated a reading program throughout the city 's libraries , and chose his favorite book , To Kill a Mockingbird , as the first title of the One City , One Book program . Lee declared that " there is no greater honor the novel could receive " . By 2004 , the novel had been chosen by 25 communities for variations of the citywide reading program , more than any other novel . David Kipen of the National Endowment of the Arts , who supervised The Big Read , states " people just seem to connect with it . It dredges up things in their own lives , their interactions across racial lines , legal encounters , and childhood . It 's just this skeleton key to so many different parts of people 's lives , and they cherish it . "
In the traditional domain noted in RFC 1591 , .org is for " organizations that did n't fit anywhere else " in the naming system , which implies that it is the proper category for non-commercial organizations if they are not governmental , educational , or one of the other types with a specific TLD . It is not designated specifically for charitable organizations or any specific organizational or tax-law status , however ; it encompasses anything that is not classifiable as another category . Currently , no restrictions are enforced on registration of .com or .org , so one can find organizations of all sorts in either of these domains , as well as other top-level domains including newer , more specific ones which may apply to particular sorts of organizations such as .museum for museums or .coop for cooperatives . Organizations might also register by the appropriate country code top-level domain for their country .
Oklahoma City , lying in the Great Plains region , features one of the largest livestock markets in the world . Oil , natural gas , petroleum products and related industries are the largest sector of the local economy . The city is situated in the middle of an active oil field and oil derricks dot the capitol grounds . The federal government employs large numbers of workers at Tinker Air Force Base and the United States Department of Transportation 's Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center ( these two sites house several offices of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation Department 's Enterprise Service Center , respectively ) .
Islam arrived 1,400 years ago in Zhejiang . Today Islam is practiced by a small number of people including virtually all the Hui Chinese living in Zhejiang . Another religion present in the province is She shamanism ( practiced by She ethnic minority ) .
Agriculture accounted for less than 20 % of both net material product and total employment before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 . After independence , the importance of agriculture in the economy increased markedly , its share at the end of the 1990s rising to more than 30 % of GDP and more than 40 % of total employment . This increase in the importance of agriculture was attributable to food security needs of the population in the face of uncertainty during the first phases of transition and the collapse of the non-agricultural sectors of the economy in the early 1990s . As the economic situation stabilized and growth resumed , the share of agriculture in GDP dropped to slightly over 20 % ( 2006 data ) , although the share of agriculture in employment remained more than 40 % .
Another study on men and women 's patterns of sexual arousal confirmed that men and women have different patterns of arousal , independent of their sexual orientations . The study found that women 's genitals become aroused to both human and nonhuman stimuli from movies showing humans of both genders having sex ( heterosexual and homosexual ) and from videos showing non-human primates ( bonobos ) having sex . Men did not show any sexual arousal to non-human visual stimuli , their arousal patterns being in line with their specific sexual interest ( women for heterosexual men and men for homosexual men ) .
Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper , aluminium , and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting , especially in the automotive , electrical , and hardware industries . These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak . An example of this is zinc aluminium . The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes the production of small and intricate shapes possible . The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and therefore fast assembly is possible . Another alloy , marketed under the brand name Prestal , contains 78 % zinc and 22 % aluminium and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic . This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement .
Some independent stereo manufacturers including JVC , Pioneer , Kenwood , Alpine , Sony , and Harman Kardon also have iPod-specific integration solutions . Alternative connection methods include adapter kits ( that use the cassette deck or the CD changer port ) , audio input jacks , and FM transmitters such as the iTrip—although personal FM transmitters are illegal in some countries . Many car manufacturers have added audio input jacks as standard .
In modern times , a process of devolution in the United Kingdom has decentralised power once again . Since the 1997 referendums in Scotland and Wales and the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland , three of the four constituent countries of the UK now have some level of autonomy . Government has been devolved to the Scottish Parliament , the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly . England does not have its own parliament and English affairs continue to be decided by the Westminster Parliament . In 1998 a set of eight unelected Regional assemblies , or chambers , was created to support the English Regional Development Agencies , but these were abolished between 2008 and 2010 . The Regions of England continue to be used in certain governmental administrative functions .
West founded the record label and production company GOOD Music in 2004 , in conjunction with Sony BMG , shortly after releasing his debut album , The College Dropout . John Legend , Common , and West were the label 's inaugural artists . The label houses artists including West , Big Sean , Pusha T , Teyana Taylor , Yasiin Bey / Mos Def , D'banj and John Legend , and producers including Hudson Mohawke , Q-Tip , Travis Scott , No I.D. , Jeff Bhasker , and S1 . GOOD Music has released ten albums certified gold or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . In November 2015 , West appointed Pusha T the new president of GOOD Music .
Following the end of World War II the educational gap between White and Black Americans was widened by Dwight D. Eisenhower 's GI Bill . This piece of legislation paved the way for white GIs to attend college . Despite their veteran status returning black servicemen were not afforded loans at the same rate as whites . Furthermore , at the time of its introduction , segregation was still the law of the land barring blacks from the best institutions . Overall , " Nearly 8 million servicemen and servicewomen were educated under the provisions of the GI Bill after World War II . But for blacks , higher educational opportunities were so few that the promise of the GI Bill went largely unfulfilled . "
The study of plants is vital because they underpin almost all animal life on Earth by generating a large proportion of the oxygen and food that provide humans and other organisms with aerobic respiration with the chemical energy they need to exist . Plants , algae and cyanobacteria are the major groups of organisms that carry out photosynthesis , a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars that can be used both as a source of chemical energy and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells . As a by-product of photosynthesis , plants release oxygen into the atmosphere , a gas that is required by nearly all living things to carry out cellular respiration . In addition , they are influential in the global carbon and water cycles and plant roots bind and stabilise soils , preventing soil erosion . Plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food , oxygen , medicine , and products for people , as well as creating and preserving soil .
In 2008 , the main media were owned by the government , but many more privately run forms of media were being created . There is one government-owned television station and around 10 small private television channels .
Three-phase AC railway electrification was used in Italy , Switzerland and the United States in the early twentieth century . Italy was the major user , for lines in the mountainous regions of northern Italy from 1901 until 1976 . The first lines were the Burgdorf-Thun line in Switzerland ( 1899 ) , and the lines of the Ferrovia Alta Valtellina from Colico to Chiavenna and Tirano in Italy , which were electrified in 1901 and 1902 . Other lines where the three-phase system were used were the Simplon Tunnel in Switzerland from 1906 to 1930 , and the Cascade Tunnel of the Great Northern Railway in the United States from 1909 to 1927 .
Madonna was born to Catholic parents Silvio Anthony " Tony " Ciccone ( b . 1931 ) and Madonna Louise Fortin ( c. 1933 – December 1 , 1963 ) in Bay City , Michigan , on August 16 , 1958 . Her father 's parents were immigrants from Pacentro , Italy , while her mother was of French-Canadian ancestry . Tony worked as an engineer designer for Chrysler and General Motors . Since Madonna had the same name as her mother , family members called her " Little Nonni " . She has two elder brothers , Anthony ( born 1956 ) and Martin ( born 1957 ) , and three younger siblings , Paula ( born 1959 ) , Christopher ( born 1960 ) , and Melanie ( born 1962 ) .
In the wake of the discovery , there was much nationalistic rivalry between the French and the British over who deserved credit for the discovery . Eventually , an international consensus emerged that both Le Verrier and Adams jointly deserved credit . Since 1966 , Dennis Rawlins has questioned the credibility of Adams 's claim to co-discovery , and the issue was re-evaluated by historians with the return in 1998 of the " Neptune papers " ( historical documents ) to the Royal Observatory , Greenwich . After reviewing the documents , they suggest that " Adams does not deserve equal credit with Le Verrier for the discovery of Neptune . That credit belongs only to the person who succeeded both in predicting the planet 's place and in convincing astronomers to search for it . "
The RCC implemented measures for social reform , adopting sharia as a basis . The consumption of alcohol was banned , night clubs and Christian churches were shut down , traditional Libyan dress was encouraged , while Arabic was decreed as the only language permitted in official communications and on road signs . From 1969 to 1973 , the RCC introduced social welfare programs funded with oil money , which led to house-building projects and improved healthcare and education . In doing so , they greatly expanded the public sector , providing employment for thousands .
The Spanish ship San Pedro and two other vessels in an expedition commanded by Miguel López de Legazpi discovered an island on January 9 , 1530 , possibly Mejit , at 10°N , which they named " Los Barbudos " . The Spaniards went ashore and traded with the local inhabitants . On January 10 , the Spaniards sighted another island that they named " Placeres " , perhaps Ailuk ; ten leagues away , they sighted another island that they called " Pajares " ( perhaps Jemo ) . On January 12 , they sighted another island at 10°N that they called " Corrales " ( possibly Wotho ) . On January 15 , the Spaniards sighted another low island , perhaps Ujelang , at 10°N , where they described the people on " Barbudos " . After that , ships including the San Jeronimo , Los Reyes and Todos los Santos also visited the islands in different years .
Material transport elevators generally consist of an inclined plane on which a conveyor belt runs . The conveyor often includes partitions to ensure that the material moves forward . These elevators are often used in industrial and agricultural applications . When such mechanisms ( or spiral screws or pneumatic transport ) are used to elevate grain for storage in large vertical silos , the entire structure is called a grain elevator . Belt elevators are often used in docks for loading loose materials such as coal , iron ore and grain into the holds of bulk carriers
Eritrea is a one-party state in which national legislative elections have been repeatedly postponed . According to Human Rights Watch , the government 's human rights record is considered among the worst in the world . Most Western countries have accused the Eritrean authorities of arbitrary arrest and detentions , and of detaining an unknown number of people without charge for their political activism . However , the Eritrean government has continually dismissed the accusations as politically motivated . In June 2015 , a 500-page United Nations Human Rights Council report accused Eritrea 's government of extrajudicial executions , torture , indefinitely prolonged national service and forced labour , and indicated that sexual harassment , rape and sexual servitude by state officials are also widespread .
Besides parents , Liu Shaokun ( 刘绍坤 ) , a Sichuan school teacher , was detained on June 25 , 2008 for " disseminating rumors and destroying social order " about the Sichuan earthquake . Liu’s family was later told that he was being investigated on suspicion of the crime of inciting subversion . Liu had travelled to the Shifang , taken photos of collapsed school buildings , and put them online . He had also expressed his anger at “the shoddy tofu-dregs buildings” ( 豆腐渣工程 ) in a media interview . He was ordered to serve one year of re-education through labor ( RTL ) . According to the organization Human Rights in China , Liu has been released to serve his RTL sentence outside of the labor camp .
Polyols , compounds containing more than one alcohol functional group , generally interact with cupric salts . For example , copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars . Specifically , using Benedict 's reagent and Fehling 's solution the presence of the sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu ( II ) to reddish copper ( I ) oxide . Schweizer 's reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose . Amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper ( II ) . Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist , one involving potassium ferrocyanide , which gives a brown precipitate with copper ( II ) salts .
During the reign of the Jiajing Emperor ( r. 1521–1567 ) , the native Chinese ideology of Daoism was fully sponsored at the Ming court , while Tibetan Vajrayana and even Chinese Buddhism were ignored or suppressed . Even the History of Ming states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point . Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era , an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet . The court eunuchs were in favor of expanding and building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as Portugal , which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had an affinity for foreign and exotic people .
The act of predation can be broken down into a maximum of four stages : Detection of prey , attack , capture and finally consumption . The relationship between predator and prey is one that is typically beneficial to the predator , and detrimental to the prey species . Sometimes , however , predation has indirect benefits to the prey species , though the individuals preyed upon themselves do not benefit . This means that , at each applicable stage , predator and prey species are in an evolutionary arms race to maximize their respective abilities to obtain food or avoid being eaten . This interaction has resulted in a vast array of adaptations in both groups .
The following sulfonylureas have been commercialized for weed control : amidosulfuron , azimsulfuron , bensulfuron-methyl , chlorimuron-ethyl , ethoxysulfuron , flazasulfuron , flupyrsulfuron-methyl-sodium , halosulfuron-methyl , imazosulfuron , nicosulfuron , oxasulfuron , primisulfuron-methyl , pyrazosulfuron-ethyl , rimsulfuron , sulfometuron-methyl Sulfosulfuron , terbacil , bispyribac-sodium , cyclosulfamuron , and pyrithiobac-sodium . Nicosulfuron , triflusulfuron methyl , and chlorsulfuron are broad-spectrum herbicides that kill plants by inhibiting the enzyme acetolactate synthase . In the 1960s , more than 1 kg/ha ( 0.89 lb/acre ) crop protection chemical was typically applied , while sulfonylureates allow as little as 1 % as much material to achieve the same effect .
Accounts of the use of leeches for the medically dubious practise of blood-letting have come from China around 30 AD , India around 200 AD , ancient Rome around 50 AD and later throughout Europe . In the 19th century medical demand for leeches was so high that some areas ' stocks were exhausted and other regions imposed restrictions or bans on exports , and Hirudo medicinalis is treated as an endangered species by both IUCN and CITES . More recently leeches have been used to assist in microsurgery , and their saliva has provided anti-inflammatory compounds and several important anticoagulants , one of which also prevents tumors from spreading .

The war had also brought to an end the " Old System " of alliances in Europe , In the years after the war , under the direction of Lord Sandwich , the British did try to re-establish this system . But after her surprising grand success against a coalition of great powers , European states such as Austria , The Dutch Republic , Sweden , Denmark-Norway , Ottoman Empire , and Russia now saw Britain as a greater threat than France and did not join them , while the Prussians were angered by what they considered a British betrayal in 1762 . Consequently , when the American War of Independence turned into a global war between 1778–83 , Britain found itself opposed by a strong coalition of European powers , and lacking any substantial ally .
Hack Wilson set a record of 56 home-runs and 190 runs-batted-in in 1930 , breaking Lou Gehrig 's MLB record of 176 RBI . ( In 1999 , a long-lost extra RBI mistakenly credited to Charlie Grimm had been found by Cooperstown researcher Cliff Kachline and verified by historian Jerome Holtzman , increasing the record number to 191 . ) As of 2014 the record still stands , with no serious threats coming since Gehrig ( 184 ) and Hank Greenberg ( 183 ) in the same era . The closest anyone has come to the mark in the last 75 years was Manny Ramirez 's 165 RBI in 1999 . In addition to the RBI record , Wilson 56 home-runs stood as the National League record until 1998 , when Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire hit 66 and 70 , respectively . Wilson was named " Most Useful " player that year by the Baseball Writers ' Association of America , as the official N.L . Most Valuable Player Award was not awarded until the next season .
Some commentators have defined reverse discrimination as a policy or practice in which members of a majority are discriminated against in favor of a historically disadvantaged group or minority . [ non-primary source needed ] Many argue that reverse discrimination results from affirmative action policies and that these policies are just another form of discrimination no different from examples in the past . People like Ward Connerly assert that affirmative action requires the very discrimination it is seeking to eliminate . According to these opponents , this contradiction might make affirmative action counter-productive . One argument for reverse discrimination is the idea that affirmative action encourages mediocrity and incompetence . Job positions would not be offered to the applicants who are the most qualified , but to applicants with a special trait such as a certain race , ethnicity , or gender . For example , opponents say affirmative action causes unprepared applicants to be accepted in highly demanding educational institutions or jobs which result in eventual failure ( see , for example , Richard Sander 's study of affirmative action in Law School , bar exam and eventual performance at law firms ) . Other opponents say that affirmative action lowers the bar and so denies those who strive for excellence on their own merit and the sense of real achievement . Opponents of affirmative action suggest that merit should be the primary factor considered in applying for job positions , college , graduate school , etc .
The company 's 14 member Board of Directors is responsible for overall corporate management . As of Cathie Black 's resignation in November 2010 its membership ( by affiliation and year of joining ) included : Alain J. P. Belda '08 ( Alcoa ) , William R.

The Western family includes Parthian ( Arsacid Pahlavi ) and Middle Persian , while Bactrian , Sogdian , Khwarezmian , Saka , and Old Ossetic ( Scytho-Sarmatian ) fall under the Eastern category . The two languages of the Western group were linguistically very close to each other , but quite distinct from their eastern counterparts . On the other hand , the Eastern group was an areal entity whose languages retained some similarity to Avestan . They were inscribed in various Aramaic-derived alphabets which had ultimately evolved from the Achaemenid Imperial Aramaic script , though Bactrian was written using an adapted Greek script .
As another example , she points to work by Thomas et al. , who sought to distinguish between the Y chromosomes of Jewish priests ( Kohanim ) , ( in Judaism , membership in the priesthood is passed on through the father 's line ) and the Y chromosomes of non-Jews . Abu el-Haj concluded that this new " race science " calls attention to the importance of " ancestry " ( narrowly defined , as it does not include all ancestors ) in some religions and in popular culture , and people 's desire to use science to confirm their claims about ancestry ; this " race science " , she argues , is fundamentally different from older notions of race that were used to explain differences in human behaviour or social status :
Yale has numerous athletic facilities , including the Yale Bowl ( the nation 's first natural " bowl " stadium , and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl ) , located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex , and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium , the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world . October 21 , 2000 , marked the dedication of Yale 's fourth new boathouse in 157 years of collegiate rowing . The Richard Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder '79 and her father Richard Gilder '54 , who gave $ 4 million towards the $ 7.5 million project . Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men 's team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race .

For the first two years Confederate forces did well in set battles but lost control of the border states . The Confederates had the advantage of defending a very large country in an area where disease caused twice as many deaths as combat . The Union pursued a strategy of seizing the coastline , blockading the ports , and taking control of the river systems . By 1863 the Confederacy was being strangled . Its eastern armies fought well , but the western armies were defeated one after another until the Union forces captured New Orleans in 1862 along with the Tennessee River . In the famous Vicksburg Campaign of 1862–63 , Ulysses Grant seized the Mississippi River and cut off the Southwest . Grant took command of Union forces in 1864 and after a series of battles with very heavy casualties , he had Lee under siege in Richmond as William T. Sherman captured Atlanta and marched through Georgia and the Carolinas . The Confederate capital was abandoned in April 1865 and Lee subsequently surrendered his army at Appomattox Court House ; all other Confederate armies surrendered within a few months .
On April 6 , 1990 , the Lviv City Council voted to return St. George Cathedral to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church . The Russian Orthodox Church refused to yield . On April 29–30 , 1990 , the Ukrainian Helsinki Union disbanded to form the Ukrainian Republican Party . On May 15 the new parliament convened . The bloc of conservative communists held 239 seats ; the Democratic Bloc , which had evolved into the National Council , had 125 deputies . On June 4 , 1990 , two candidates remained in the protracted race for parliament chair . The leader of the Communist Party of Ukraine ( CPU ) , Volodymyr Ivashko , was elected with 60 percent of the vote as more than 100 opposition deputies boycotted the election . On June 5–6 , 1990 , Metropolitan Mstyslav of the U.S.-based Ukrainian Orthodox Church was elected patriarch of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church ( UAOC ) during that Church 's first synod . The UAOC declared its full independence from the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church , which in March had granted autonomy to the Ukrainian Orthodox church headed by Metropolitan Filaret .
The 16th and 17th centuries are regarded as something of a " dark age " in Greek history , with the prospect of overthrowing Ottoman rule appearing remote with only the Ionian islands remaining free of Turkish domination . Corfu withstood three major sieges in 1537 , 1571 and 1716 all of which resulted in the repulsion of the Ottomans . However , in the 18th century , there arose through shipping a wealthy and dispersed Greek merchant class . These merchants came to dominate trade within the Ottoman Empire , establishing communities throughout the Mediterranean , the Balkans , and Western Europe . Though the Ottoman conquest had cut Greece off from significant European intellectual movements such as the Reformation and the Enlightenment , these ideas together with the ideals of the French Revolution and romantic nationalism began to penetrate the Greek world via the mercantile diaspora . [ page needed ] In the late 18th century , Rigas Feraios , the first revolutionary to envision an independent Greek state , published a series of documents relating to Greek independence , including but not limited to a national anthem and the first detailed map of Greece , in Vienna , and was murdered by Ottoman agents in 1798 .

In ancient Somalia , pyramidical structures known in Somali as taalo were a popular burial style , with hundreds of these dry stone monuments scattered around the country today . Houses were built of dressed stone similar to the ones in Ancient Egypt . There are also examples of courtyards and large stone walls enclosing settlements , such as the Wargaade Wall .
The Marshall Islands , officially the Republic of the Marshall Islands ( Marshallese : Aolepān Aorōkin M̧ajeļ ) , [ note 1 ] is an island country located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean , slightly west of the International Date Line . Geographically , the country is part of the larger island group of Micronesia . The country 's population of 53,158 people ( at the 2011 Census ) is spread out over 29 coral atolls , comprising 1,156 individual islands and islets . The islands share maritime boundaries with the Federated States of Micronesia to the west , Wake Island to the north , [ note 2 ] Kiribati to the south-east , and Nauru to the south . About 27,797 of the islanders ( at the 2011 Census ) live on Majuro , which contains the capital .
The hole walls for boards with two or more layers can be made conductive and then electroplated with copper to form plated-through holes . These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB . For multi-layer boards , those with three layers or more , drilling typically produces a smear of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system . Before the holes can be plated through , this smear must be removed by a chemical de-smear process , or by plasma-etch . The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through . On high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma . The etch-back removes resin and the glass fibers so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as the hole is plated become integral with the deposited copper .
The assertion that the Cubist depiction of space , mass , time , and volume supports ( rather than contradicts ) the flatness of the canvas was made by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler as early as 1920 , but it was subject to criticism in the 1950s and 1960s , especially by Clement Greenberg . Contemporary views of Cubism are complex , formed to some extent in response to the " Salle 41 " Cubists , whose methods were too distinct from those of Picasso and Braque to be considered merely secondary to them . Alternative interpretations of Cubism have therefore developed . Wider views of Cubism include artists who were later associated with the " Salle 41 " artists , e.g. , Francis Picabia ; the brothers Jacques Villon , Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp , who beginning in late 1911 formed the core of the Section d'Or ( or the Puteaux Group ) ; the sculptors Alexander Archipenko , Joseph Csaky and Ossip Zadkine as well as Jacques Lipchitz and Henri Laurens ; and painters such as Louis Marcoussis , Roger de La Fresnaye , František Kupka , Diego Rivera , Léopold Survage , Auguste Herbin , André Lhote , Gino Severini ( after 1916 ) , María Blanchard ( after 1916 ) and Georges Valmier ( after 1918 ) . More fundamentally , Christopher Green argues that Douglas Cooper 's terms were " later undermined by interpretations of the work of Picasso , Braque , Gris and Léger that stress iconographic and ideological questions rather than methods of representation . "
So that the maximum number of colors can be accurately reproduced on your computer screen , each color has been given a code number , or sRGB , which tells your computer the intensity of the red , green and blue components of that color . The intensity of each component is measured on a scale of zero to 255 , which means the complete list includes 16,777,216 distinct colors and shades . The sRGB number of pure red , for example , is 255 , 00 , 00 , which means the red component is at its maximum intensity , and there is no green or blue . The sRGB number for crimson is 220 , 20 , 60 , which means that the red is slightly less intense and therefore darker , there is some green , which leans it toward orange ; and there is a larger amount of blue , which makes it slightly blue-violet .
The major soap operas on British television each feature a pub , and these pubs have become household names . The Rovers Return is the pub in Coronation Street , the British soap broadcast on ITV . The Queen Vic ( short for the Queen Victoria ) is the pub in EastEnders , the major soap on BBC One and the Woolpack in ITV 's Emmerdale . The sets of each of the three major television soap operas have been visited by some of the members of the royal family , including Queen Elizabeth II . The centrepiece of each visit was a trip into the Rovers , the Queen Vic , or the Woolpack to be offered a drink . The Bull in the BBC Radio 4 soap opera The Archers is an important meeting point .
Guinea-Bissau is a member of the United Nations , African Union , Economic Community of West African States , Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , the Latin Union , Community of Portuguese Language Countries , La Francophonie and the South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone .
Westminster Abbey , formally titled the Collegiate Church of St Peter at Westminster , is a large , mainly Gothic abbey church in the City of Westminster , London , located just to the west of the Palace of Westminster . It is one of the most notable religious buildings in the United Kingdom and has been the traditional place of coronation and burial site for English and , later , British monarchs . Between 1540 and 1556 the abbey had the status of a cathedral . Since 1560 , however , the building is no longer an abbey nor a cathedral , having instead the status of a Church of England " Royal Peculiar " —a church responsible directly to the sovereign . The building itself is the original abbey church .
It is now known that the molecular circadian clock can function within a single cell ; i.e. , it is cell-autonomous . This was shown by Gene Block in isolated mollusk BRNs . [ clarification needed ] At the same time , different cells may communicate with each other resulting in a synchronised output of electrical signaling . These may interface with endocrine glands of the brain to result in periodic release of hormones . The receptors for these hormones may be located far across the body and synchronise the peripheral clocks of various organs . Thus , the information of the time of the day as relayed by the eyes travels to the clock in the brain , and , through that , clocks in the rest of the body may be synchronised . This is how the timing of , for example , sleep/wake , body temperature , thirst , and appetite are coordinately controlled by the biological clock . [ citation needed ]
Another major way to distinguish different memory functions is whether the content to be remembered is in the past , retrospective memory , or in the future , prospective memory . Thus , retrospective memory as a category includes semantic , episodic and autobiographical memory . In contrast , prospective memory is memory for future intentions , or remembering to remember ( Winograd , 1988 ) . Prospective memory can be further broken down into event- and time-based prospective remembering . Time-based prospective memories are triggered by a time-cue , such as going to the doctor ( action ) at 4pm ( cue ) . Event-based prospective memories are intentions triggered by cues , such as remembering to post a letter ( action ) after seeing a mailbox ( cue ) . Cues do not need to be related to the action ( as the mailbox/letter example ) , and lists , sticky-notes , knotted handkerchiefs , or string around the finger all exemplify cues that people use as strategies to enhance prospective memory .
Many of the world 's largest cruise ships can regularly be seen in Southampton water , including record-breaking vessels from Royal Caribbean and Carnival Corporation & plc . The latter has headquarters in Southampton , with its brands including Princess Cruises , P & O Cruises and Cunard Line .
Many teachers at Sabha were Egyptian , and for the first time Gaddafi had access to pan-Arab newspapers and radio broadcasts , most notably the Cairo-based Voice of the Arabs . Growing up , Gaddafi witnessed significant events rock the Arab world , including the 1948 Arab–Israeli War , the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 , the Suez Crisis of 1956 , and the short-lived existence of the United Arab Republic between 1958 and 1961 . Gaddafi admired the political changes implemented in the Arab Republic of Egypt under his hero , President Gamal Abdel Nasser . Nasser argued for Arab nationalism ; the rejection of Western colonialism , neo-colonialism , and Zionism ; and a transition from capitalism to socialism . Nasser 's book , Philosophy of the Revolution , was a key influence on Gaddafi ; outlining how to initiate a coup , it has been described as " the inspiration and blueprint of [ Gaddafi 's ] revolution . "
The first task of a database designer is to produce a conceptual data model that reflects the structure of the information to be held in the database . A common approach to this is to develop an entity-relationship model , often with the aid of drawing tools . Another popular approach is the Unified Modeling Language . A successful data model will accurately reflect the possible state of the external world being modeled : for example , if people can have more than one phone number , it will allow this information to be captured . Designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain ; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organisation , like " can a customer also be a supplier ? " , or " if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging , are those the same product or different products ? " , or " if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt , is that one flight or two ( or maybe even three ) ? " . The answers to these questions establish definitions of the terminology used for entities ( customers , products , flights , flight segments ) and their relationships and attributes .
The northeastern Puntland region has around six private radio stations , including Radio Garowe , Radio Daljir , Radio Codka-Nabbada and Radio Codka-Mudug . Radio Gaalkacyo , formerly known as Radio Free Somalia , operates from Galkayo in the north-central Mudug province . Additionally , the Somaliland region in the northwest has one government-operated radio station .
In 1954 , then-mayor Richard C. Lee began some of the earliest major urban renewal projects in the United States . Certain sections of downtown New Haven were redeveloped to include museums , new office towers , a hotel , and large shopping complexes . Other parts of the city were affected by the construction of Interstate 95 along the Long Wharf section , Interstate 91 , and the Oak Street Connector . The Oak Street Connector ( Route 34 ) , running between Interstate 95 , downtown , and The Hill neighborhood , was originally intended as a highway to the city 's western suburbs but was only completed as a highway to the downtown area , with the area to the west becoming a boulevard ( See " Redevelopment " below ) .
To the southwest , the principality of Halych had developed trade relations with its Polish , Hungarian and Lithuanian neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus ' . In 1199 , Prince Roman Mstislavich united the two previously separate principalities . In 1202 he conquered Kiev , and assumed the title of Grand Duke of Kievan Rus ' , which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169 . His son , Prince Daniil ( r. 1238–1264 ) looked for support from the West . He accepted a crown as a " Rex Rusiae " ( " King of Russia " ) from the Roman papacy , apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople . In 1370 , the patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church in Constantinople granted the King of Poland a metropolitan for his Russian subjects . Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards . Cyprian , a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers , became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382 ; this way the church in the Russian countries was reunited for some time . In 1439 , Kiev became the seat of a separate " Metropolitan of Kiev , Galich and all Rus ' " for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule .
The British declaration of war on Germany and its allies also committed the colonies and Dominions , which provided invaluable military , financial and material support . Over 2.5 million men served in the armies of the Dominions , as well as many thousands of volunteers from the Crown colonies . The contributions of Australian and New Zealand troops during the 1915 Gallipoli Campaign against the Ottoman Empire had a great impact on the national consciousness at home , and marked a watershed in the transition of Australia and New Zealand from colonies to nations in their own right . The countries continue to commemorate this occasion on Anzac Day . Canadians viewed the Battle of Vimy Ridge in a similar light . The important contribution of the Dominions to the war effort was recognised in 1917 by the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George when he invited each of the Dominion Prime Ministers to join an Imperial War Cabinet to co-ordinate imperial policy .
In Europe , the copyright infringement case Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd v Newspaper Licensing Agency Ltd had two prongs ; one concerned whether a news aggregator service infringed the copyright of the news generators ; the other concerned whether the temporary web cache created by the web browser of a consumer of the aggregator 's service , also infringed the copyright of the news generators . The first prong was decided in favor of the news generators ; in June 2014 the second prong was decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union ( CJEU ) , which ruled that the temporary web cache of consumers of the aggregator did not infringe the copyright of the news generators .
The Somali Telecommunication Association ( STA ) , a watchdog organization that oversees the policy development and regulatory framework of Somalia 's ICT sector , reported in 2006 that there were over half a million users of internet services within the territory . There were also 22 established ISPs and 234 cyber cafes , with an annual growth rate of 15.6 % .
The IANA time zone database maps a name to the named location 's historical and predicted clock shifts . This database is used by many computer software systems , including most Unix-like operating systems , Java , and the Oracle RDBMS ; HP 's " tztab " database is similar but incompatible . When temporal authorities change DST rules , zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary system maintenance . In Unix-like systems the TZ environment variable specifies the location name , as in TZ= ' : America/New_York ' . In many of those systems there is also a system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is n't set : this setting is controlled by the contents of the /etc/localtime file , which is usually a symbolic link or hard link to one of the zoneinfo files . Internal time is stored in timezone-independent epoch time ; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display .
Most birds can fly , which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes . Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding , feeding , and predator avoidance and escape . Birds have various adaptations for flight , including a lightweight skeleton , two large flight muscles , the pectoralis ( which accounts for 15 % of the total mass of the bird ) and the supracoracoideus , as well as a modified forelimb ( wing ) that serves as an aerofoil . Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species ' type of flight ; many birds combine powered , flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight . About 60 extant bird species are flightless , as were many extinct birds . Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands , probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators . Though flightless , penguins use similar musculature and movements to " fly " through the water , as do auks , shearwaters and dippers .
For much of the eighteenth century , France approached its wars in the same way . It would let colonies defend themselves or would offer only minimal help ( sending them limited numbers of troops or inexperienced soldiers ) , anticipating that fights for the colonies would most likely be lost anyway . This strategy was to a degree forced upon France : geography , coupled with the superiority of the British navy , made it difficult for the French navy to provide significant supplies and support to French colonies . Similarly , several long land borders made an effective domestic army imperative for any French ruler . Given these military necessities , the French government , unsurprisingly , based its strategy overwhelmingly on the army in Europe : it would keep most of its army on the continent , hoping for victories closer to home . The plan was to fight to the end of hostilities and then , in treaty negotiations , to trade territorial acquisitions in Europe to regain lost overseas possessions . This approach did not serve France well in the war , as the colonies were indeed lost , but although much of the European war went well , by its end France had few counterbalancing European successes .
Back in Warsaw that year , Chopin heard Niccolò Paganini play the violin , and composed a set of variations , Souvenir de Paganini . It may have been this experience which encouraged him to commence writing his first Études , ( 1829–32 ) , exploring the capacities of his own instrument . On 11 August , three weeks after completing his studies at the Warsaw Conservatory , he made his debut in Vienna . He gave two piano concerts and received many favourable reviews—in addition to some commenting ( in Chopin 's own words ) that he was " too delicate for those accustomed to the piano-bashing of local artists " . In one of these concerts , he premiered his Variations on Là ci darem la mano , Op . 2 ( variations on an aria from Mozart 's opera Don Giovanni ) for piano and orchestra . He returned to Warsaw in September 1829 , where he premiered his Piano Concerto No . 2 in F minor , Op . 21 on 17 March 1830 .
Compared to the vigorous convergent plate mountain-building of the late Paleozoic , Mesozoic tectonic deformation was comparatively mild . The sole major Mesozoic orogeny occurred in what is now the Arctic , creating the Innuitian orogeny , the Brooks Range , the Verkhoyansk and Cherskiy Ranges in Siberia , and the Khingan Mountains in Manchuria . This orogeny was related to the opening of the Arctic Ocean and subduction of the North China and Siberian cratons under the Pacific Ocean . Nevertheless , the era featured the dramatic rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea . Pangaea gradually split into a northern continent , Laurasia , and a southern continent , Gondwana . This created the passive continental margin that characterizes most of the Atlantic coastline ( such as along the U.S. East Coast ) today .
Modern chemistry emerged from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries through the material practices and theories promoted by alchemy , medicine , manufacturing and mining . A decisive moment came when 'chymistry ' was distinguished from alchemy by Robert Boyle in his work The Sceptical Chymist , in 1661 ; although the alchemical tradition continued for some time after his work . Other important steps included the gravimetric experimental practices of medical chemists like William Cullen , Joseph Black , Torbern Bergman and Pierre Macquer and through the work of Antoine Lavoisier ( Father of Modern Chemistry ) on oxygen and the law of conservation of mass , which refuted phlogiston theory . The theory that all matter is made of atoms , which are the smallest constituents of matter that can not be broken down without losing the basic chemical and physical properties of that matter , was provided by John Dalton in 1803 , although the question took a hundred years to settle as proven . Dalton also formulated the law of mass relationships . In 1869 , Dmitri Mendeleev composed his periodic table of elements on the basis of Dalton 's discoveries .
Perhaps the biggest sustainability problem in Tucson , with its high desert climate , is potable water supply . The state manages all water in Arizona through its Arizona Department of Water Resources ( ADWR ) . The primary consumer of water is Agriculture ( including golf courses ) , which consumes about 69 % of all water . Municipal ( which includes residential use ) accounts for about 25 % of use . Energy consumption and availability is another sustainability issue . However , with over 300 days of full sun a year , Tucson has demonstrated its potential to be an ideal solar energy producer .
Performers who have studied classical music extensively are said to be " classically trained " . This training may be from private lessons from instrument or voice teachers or from completion of a formal program offered by a Conservatory , college or university , such as a B.mus . or M.mus . degree ( which includes individual lessons from professors ) . In classical music , " ... extensive formal music education and training , often to postgraduate [ Master 's degree ] level " is required .
50 Hz systems support three scanning rates : 50i , 25p and 50p . 60 Hz systems support a much wider set of frame rates : 59.94i , 60i , 23.976p , 24p , 29.97p , 30p , 59.94p and 60p . In the days of standard definition television , the fractional rates were often rounded up to whole numbers , e.g . 23.976p was often called 24p , or 59.94i was often called 60i . 60 Hz high definition television supports both fractional and slightly different integer rates , therefore strict usage of notation is required to avoid ambiguity . Nevertheless , 29.97i/59.94i is almost universally called 60i , likewise 23.976p is called 24p .
However , the classification of madaris as " universities " is disputed on the question of understanding of each institution on its own terms . In madaris , the ijāzahs were only issued in one field , the Islamic religious law of sharīʻah , and in no other field of learning . Other academic subjects , including the natural sciences , philosophy and literary studies , were only treated " ancillary " to the study of the Sharia . For example , a natural science like astronomy was only studied ( if at all ) to supply religious needs , like the time for prayer . This is why Ptolemaic astronomy was considered adequate , and is still taught in some modern day madaris . The Islamic law undergraduate degree from al-Azhar , the most prestigious madrasa , was traditionally granted without final examinations , but on the basis of the students ' attentive attendance to courses . In contrast to the medieval doctorate which was granted by the collective authority of the faculty , the Islamic degree was not granted by the teacher to the pupil based on any formal criteria , but remained a " personal matter , the sole prerogative of the person bestowing it ; no one could force him to give one " .
Each cardinal takes on a titular church , either a church in the city of Rome or one of the suburbicarian sees . The only exception is for patriarchs of Eastern Catholic Churches . Nevertheless , cardinals possess no power of governance nor are they to intervene in any way in matters which pertain to the administration of goods , discipline , or the service of their titular churches . They are allowed to celebrate Mass and hear confessions and lead visits and pilgrimages to their titular churches , in coordination with the staff of the church . They often support their churches monetarily , and many Cardinals do keep in contact with the pastoral staffs of their titular churches .
The Pāli Tipitaka , which means " three baskets " , refers to the Vinaya Pitaka , the Sutta Pitaka , and the Abhidhamma Pitaka . The Vinaya Pitaka contains disciplinary rules for the Buddhist monks and nuns , as well as explanations of why and how these rules were instituted , supporting material , and doctrinal clarification . The Sutta Pitaka contains discourses ascribed to Gautama Buddha . The Abhidhamma Pitaka contains material often described as systematic expositions of the Gautama Buddha 's teachings .
The second-largest commercial airport is William P. Hobby Airport ( named Houston International Airport until 1967 ) which operates primarily short- to medium-haul domestic flights . However , in 2015 Southwest Airlines launched service from a new international terminal at Hobby airport to several destinations in Mexico , Central America , and the Caribbean . These were the first international flights flown from Hobby since 1969 . Houston 's aviation history is showcased in the 1940 Air Terminal Museum located in the old terminal building on the west side of the airport . Hobby Airport has been recognized with two awards for being one of the top five performing airports in the world and for customer service by Airports Council International .
The 25,000 cotton growers in the United States of America are heavily subsidized at the rate of $ 2 billion per year although China now provides the highest overall level of cotton sector support . The future of these subsidies is uncertain and has led to anticipatory expansion of cotton brokers ' operations in Africa . Dunavant expanded in Africa by buying out local operations . This is only possible in former British colonies and Mozambique ; former French colonies continue to maintain tight monopolies , inherited from their former colonialist masters , on cotton purchases at low fixed prices .
Traditionally , subspecies are seen as geographically isolated and genetically differentiated populations . That is , " the designation 'subspecies ' is used to indicate an objective degree of microevolutionary divergence " One objection to this idea is that it does not specify what degree of differentiation is required . Therefore , any population that is somewhat biologically different could be considered a subspecies , even to the level of a local population . As a result , Templeton has argued that it is necessary to impose a threshold on the level of difference that is required for a population to be designated a subspecies .
St. John 's is served by St. John 's International Airport ( YYT ) , located 10 minutes northwest of the downtown core . In 2011 , roughly 1,400,000 passengers travelled through the airport making it the second busiest airport in Atlantic Canada in passenger volume . Regular destinations include Halifax , Montreal , Ottawa , Toronto , as well as destinations throughout the province . International locations include Dublin , London , New York City , Saint Pierre and Miquelon , Glasgow and Varadero . Scheduled service providers include Air Canada , Air Canada Jazz , Air Saint-Pierre , Air Transat , United Airlines , Porter Airlines , Provincial Airlines , Sunwing Airlines and Westjet .
Hopkins ' column also drew criticism on Twitter , including from Russell Brand , to whom Hopkins responded by accusing Brand 's " champagne socialist humanity " of neglecting taxpayers . Simon Usborne , writing in The Independent , compared her use of the word " cockroach " to previous uses by the Nazis and just before the Rwandan Genocide by its perpetrators . He suspected that if any other contributor had written the piece it would not have been published and questioned her continued employment by the newspaper . Zoe Williams commented in The Guardian : " It is no joke when people start talking like this . We are not 'giving her what she wants ' when we make manifest our disgust . It is not a free speech issue . I’m not saying gag her : I’m saying fight her " .
By 1916 , when millions of Europeans were becoming casualties of imperial war in the trenches of eastern and western Europe over " the eastern question , " Arnold J. Toynbee , Hegelesque historian of civilization at large , was becoming metaphysical about the Near East . Geography alone was not a sufficient explanation of the terms , he believed . If the Ottoman Empire had been a sick man , then :
In other events of the nineteenth century , The Times opposed the repeal of the Corn Laws until the number of demonstrations convinced the editorial board otherwise , and only reluctantly supported aid to victims of the Irish Potato Famine . It enthusiastically supported the Great Reform Bill of 1832 , which reduced corruption and increased the electorate from 400,000 people to 800,000 people ( still a small minority of the population ) . During the American Civil War , The Times represented the view of the wealthy classes , favouring the secessionists , but it was not a supporter of slavery .
In 1992 , the First Division clubs resigned from the Football League en masse and on 27 May 1992 the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company working out of an office at the Football Association 's then headquarters in Lancaster Gate . This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions ; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three . There was no change in competition format ; the same number of teams competed in the top flight , and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted .
Many prokaryotic genes are organized into operons , with multiple protein-coding sequences that are transcribed as a unit . The products of operon genes typically have related functions and are involved in the same regulatory network . :7.3
After the lengthy Iraq disarmament crisis culminated with an American demand that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein leave Iraq , which was refused , a coalition led by the United States and the United Kingdom fought the Iraqi army in the 2003 invasion of Iraq . Approximately 250,000 United States troops , with support from 45,000 British , 2,000 Australian and 200 Polish combat forces , entered Iraq primarily through their staging area in Kuwait . ( Turkey had refused to permit its territory to be used for an invasion from the north . ) Coalition forces also supported Iraqi Kurdish militia , estimated to number upwards of 50,000 . After approximately three weeks of fighting , Hussein and the Ba'ath Party were forcibly removed , followed by 9 years of military presence by the United States and the coalition fighting alongside the newly elected Iraqi government against various insurgent groups .
Throughout the history of the South Slavs , the vernacular , literary , and written languages ( e.g . Chakavian , Kajkavian , Shtokavian ) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently . Prior to the 19th century , they were collectively called " Illyric " , " Slavic " , " Slavonian " , " Bosnian " , " Dalmatian " , " Serbian " or " Croatian " . As such , the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824 , popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades , and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859 . At that time , Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires . Officially , the language was called variously Serbo-Croat , Croato-Serbian , Serbian and Croatian , Croatian and Serbian , Serbian or Croatian , Croatian or Serbian . Unofficially , Serbs and Croats typically called the language " Serbian " or " Croatian " , respectively , without implying a distinction between the two , and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina , " Bosnian " , " Croatian " , and " Serbian " were considered to be three names of a single official language . Croatian linguist Dalibor Brozović advocated the term Serbo-Croatian as late as 1988 , claiming that in an analogy with Indo-European , Serbo-Croatian does not only name the two components of the same language , but simply charts the limits of the region in which it is spoken and includes everything between the limits ( ‘Bosnian’ and ‘Montenegrin’ ) . Today , use of the term " Serbo-Croatian " is controversial due to the prejudice that nation and language must match . It is still used for lack of a succinct alternative , though alternative names have been used , such as Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian ( BCS ) , which is often seen in political contexts such as the Hague War Crimes tribunal .
In 2011 , the foundation launched a program called " Reinvent the Toilet Challenge " with the aim to promote the development of innovations in toilet design to benefit the 2.5 billion people that do not have access to safe and effective sanitation . This program has generated significant interest of the mainstream media . It was complemented by a program called " Grand Challenges Explorations " ( 2011 to 2013 with some follow-up grants reaching until 2015 ) which involved grants of US $ 100,000 each in the first round . Both funding schemes explicitly excluded project ideas that relied on centralized sewerage systems or are not compatible with development country contexts .
Several systems were proposed as the new standard for the US , including the Japanese MUSE system , but all were rejected by the FCC because of their higher bandwidth requirements . At this time , the number of television channels was growing rapidly and bandwidth was already a problem . A new standard had to be more efficient , needing less bandwidth for HDTV than the existing NTSC .
Generally , the greater the contact and exchange that have existed between two languages , or between those languages and a third one , the greater is the ratio of metaphrase to paraphrase that may be used in translating among them . However , due to shifts in ecological niches of words , a common etymology is sometimes misleading as a guide to current meaning in one or the other language . For example , the English actual should not be confused with the cognate French actuel ( " present " , " current " ) , the Polish aktualny ( " present " , " current , " " topical , " " timely , " " feasible " ) , the Swedish aktuell ( " topical " , " presently of importance " ) , the Russian актуальный ( " urgent " , " topical " ) or the Dutch actueel .
Florida High Speed Rail was a proposed government backed high-speed rail system that would have connected Miami , Orlando , and Tampa . The first phase was planned to connect Orlando and Tampa and was offered federal funding , but it was turned down by Governor Rick Scott in 2011 . The second phase of the line was envisioned to connect Miami . By 2014 , a private project known as All Aboard Florida by a company of the historic Florida East Coast Railway began construction of a higher-speed rail line in South Florida that is planned to eventually terminate at Orlando International Airport .
In 677 ( during the reign of Emperor Gaozong ) , Chen Zheng ( 陳政 ) , together with his son Chen Yuanguang ( 陳元光 ) , led a military expedition to pacify the rebellion in Fujian . They settled in Zhangzhou and brought the Middle Chinese phonology of northern China during the 7th century into Zhangzhou ; In 885 , ( during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang ) , the two brothers Wang Chao ( 王潮 ) and Wang Shenzhi ( 王審知 ) , led a military expedition force to pacify the Huang Chao rebellion . They brought the Middle Chinese phonology commonly spoken in Northern China into Zhangzhou . These two waves of migrations from the north generally brought the language of northern Middle Chinese into the Fujian region . This then gradually evolved into the Zhangzhou dialect .
Usually , the short-term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short-term interest rate target . In other instances , monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold . For example , in the case of the United States the Federal Reserve targets the federal funds rate , the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight . The other primary means of conducting monetary policy include : ( i ) Discount window lending ( as lender of last resort ) ; ( ii ) Fractional deposit lending ( changes in the reserve requirement ) ; ( iii ) Moral suasion ( cajoling certain market players to achieve specified outcomes ) ; ( iv ) " Open mouth operations " ( talking monetary policy with the market ) .
Tort law covers the entire imaginable spectrum of wrongs which humans can inflict upon each other , and of course , partially overlaps with wrongs also punishable by criminal law . Although the American Law Institute has attempted to standardize tort law through the development of several versions of the Restatement of Torts , many states have chosen to adopt only certain sections of the Restatements and to reject others . Thus , because of its immense size and diversity , American tort law can not be easily summarized .
In January 1938 , Milt Gabler started recording for his new label , Commodore Records , and to allow for longer continuous performances , he recorded some 12-inch records . Eddie Condon explained : " Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development . " The first two 12-inch recordings did not take advantage of the extra length : " Carnegie Drag " was 3:15 ; " Carnegie Jump " , 2:41 . But at the second session , on April 30 , the two 12-inch recordings were longer : " Embraceable You " was 4:05 ; " Serenade to a Shylock " , 4:32 . Another way around the time limitation was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record . Vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded " Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean " , written by Irving and Jack Kaufman , as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Cameo . An obvious workaround for longer recordings was to release a set of records . An early multi-record release was in 1903 , when HMV in England made the first complete recording of an opera , Verdi 's Ernani , on 40 single-sided discs . In 1940 , Commodore released Eddie Condon and his Band 's recording of " A Good Man Is Hard to Find " in four parts , issued on both sides of two 12-inch 78s . This limitation on the duration of recordings persisted from 1910 until the invention of the LP record , in 1948 . In popular music , this time limitation of about 3:30 on a 10-inch 78 rpm record meant that singers usually did not release long pieces on record . One exception is Frank Sinatra 's recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein 's " Soliloquy " , from Carousel , made on May 28 , 1946 . Because it ran 7:57 , longer than both sides of a standard 78 rpm 10-inch record , it was released on Columbia 's Masterwork label ( the classical division ) as two sides of a 12-inch record . The same was true of John Raitt 's performance of the song on the original cast album of Carousel , which had been issued on a 78-rpm album set by American Decca in 1945 .
In 1927 , the Kuomintang ( KMT ; Nationalist Party ) under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China , and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928 . The following decade is known as the Nanking decade .
While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology , it is likely to be refined in the future . Little is known about the earliest moments of the universe 's history . The Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems require the existence of a singularity at the beginning of cosmic time . However , these theorems assume that general relativity is correct , but general relativity must break down before the universe reaches the Planck temperature , and a correct treatment of quantum gravity may avoid the singularity .
Literature consists of written productions , often restricted to those deemed to have artistic or intellectual value . Its Latin root literatura/litteratura ( derived itself from littera , letter or handwriting ) was used to refer to all written accounts , but intertwined with the roman concept of cultura : learning or cultivation . Literature often uses language differently than ordinary language ( see literariness ) . Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose ; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel , short story or drama ; and works are often categorised according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations ( genre ) .
Paul VI revolutionized papal elections by ordering that only cardinals below the age of eighty might participate in future conclaves . In Ecclesiae Sanctae , his motu proprio of 6 August 1966 , he further invited all bishops to offer their retirement to the pontiff no later than the completion of their 75th year of age . This requirement was extended to all Cardinals of the Catholic Church on 21 November 1970 . With these two stipulations , the Pope filled several positions with younger bishops and cardinals , and further internationalized the Roman Curia in light of several resignations due to age .
During the English Civil War Plymouth sided with the Parliamentarians and was besieged for almost four years by the Royalists . The last major attack by the Royalist was by Sir Richard Grenville leading thousands of soldiers towards Plymouth , but they were defeated by the Plymothians at Freedom Fields Park . The civil war ended as a Parliamentary win , but monarchy was restored by King Charles II in 1660 , who imprisoned many of the Parliamentary heroes on Drake 's Island . Construction of the Royal Citadel began in 1665 , after the Restoration ; it was armed with cannon facing both out to sea and into the town , rumoured to be a reminder to residents not to oppose the Crown . Mount Batten tower also dates from around this time .
The United States recovered from the Apollo 1 fire , fixing the fatal flaws in an improved version of the Block II command module . The US proceeded with unpiloted test launches of the Saturn V launch vehicle ( Apollo 4 and Apollo 6 ) and the Lunar Module ( Apollo 5 ) during the latter half of 1967 and early 1968 . Apollo 1 's mission to check out the Apollo Command/Service Module in Earth orbit was accomplished by Grissom 's backup crew commanded by Walter Schirra on Apollo 7 , launched on October 11 , 1968 . The eleven-day mission was a total success , as the spacecraft performed a virtually flawless mission , paving the way for the United States to continue with its lunar mission schedule .
An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005 , after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before , but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season . UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League , giving England five qualifiers . UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing . However , for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League , this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league , it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league . No association can have more than four entrants in the Champions League . This occurred in 2012 , when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League the previous year , but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur , who went into the Europa League .
Short-term memory is supported by transient patterns of neuronal communication , dependent on regions of the frontal lobe ( especially dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ) and the parietal lobe . Long-term memory , on the other hand , is maintained by more stable and permanent changes in neural connections widely spread throughout the brain . The hippocampus is essential ( for learning new information ) to the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory , although it does not seem to store information itself . Without the hippocampus , new memories are unable to be stored into long-term memory , as learned from patient Henry Molaison after removal of both his hippocampi , and there will be a very short attention span . Furthermore , it may be involved in changing neural connections for a period of three months or more after the initial learning .
The average population density was 11,457 people per square mile ( 4,405.4/km² ) . The Census reported that 1,468,623 people ( 96.2 % of the population ) lived in households , 38,007 ( 2.5 % ) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters , and 19,376 ( 1.3 % ) were institutionalized . In 2013 , the city reported having 668,247 total housing units , down slightly from 670,171 housing units in 2010 . As of 2013 [ update ] , 87 percent of housing units were occupied , while 13 percent were vacant , a slight change from 2010 where 89.5 percent of units were occupied , or 599,736 and 10.5 percent were vacant , or 70,435 . Of the city 's residents , 32 percent reported having no vehicles available while 23 percent had two or more vehicles available , as of 2013 [ update ] .
Education in Switzerland is very diverse because the constitution of Switzerland delegates the authority for the school system to the cantons . There are both public and private schools , including many private international schools . The minimum age for primary school is about six years in all cantons , but most cantons provide a free " children 's school " starting at four or five years old . Primary school continues until grade four , five or six , depending on the school . Traditionally , the first foreign language in school was always one of the other national languages , although recently ( 2000 ) English was introduced first in a few cantons .
Conflict between the Germanic tribes and the forces of Rome under Julius Caesar forced major Germanic tribes to retreat to the east bank of the Rhine . Roman emperor Augustus in 12 BC ordered the conquest of the Germans , but the catastrophic Roman defeat at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest resulted in the Roman Empire abandoning its plans to completely conquer Germany . Germanic peoples in Roman territory were culturally Romanized , and although much of Germany remained free of direct Roman rule , Rome deeply influenced the development of German society , especially the adoption of Christianity by the Germans who obtained it from the Romans . In Roman-held territories with Germanic populations , the Germanic and Roman peoples intermarried , and Roman , Germanic , and Christian traditions intermingled . The adoption of Christianity would later become a major influence in the development of a common German identity .
Nonverbal communication describes the process of conveying meaning in the form of non-word messages . Examples of nonverbal communication include haptic communication , chronemic communication , gestures , body language , facial expression , eye contact , and how one dresses . Nonverbal communication also relates to intent of a message . Examples of intent are voluntary , intentional movements like shaking a hand or winking , as well as involuntary , such as sweating . Speech also contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage , e.g . rhythm , intonation , tempo , and stress . There may even be a pheromone component . Research has shown that up to 55 % of human communication may occur through non-verbal facial expressions , and a further 38 % through paralanguage . It affects communication most at the subconscious level and establishes trust . Likewise , written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style , spatial arrangement of words and the use of emoticons to convey emotion .
Athens retained its position as the most prestigious seat of higher education , especially in the domains of philosophy and rhetoric , with considerable libraries and philosophical schools . Alexandria had the monumental Museum ( i.e . research center ) and Library of Alexandria which was estimated to have had 700,000 volumes . The city of Pergamon also had a large library and became a major center of book production . The island of Rhodes had a library and also boasted a famous finishing school for politics and diplomacy . Libraries were also present in Antioch , Pella , and Kos . Cicero was educated in Athens and Mark Antony in Rhodes . Antioch was founded as a metropolis and center of Greek learning which retained its status into the era of Christianity . Seleucia replaced Babylon as the metropolis of the lower Tigris .
Externally , towers and spires are characteristic of Gothic churches both great and small , the number and positioning being one of the greatest variables in Gothic architecture . In Italy , the tower , if present , is almost always detached from the building , as at Florence Cathedral , and is often from an earlier structure . In France and Spain , two towers on the front is the norm . In England , Germany and Scandinavia this is often the arrangement , but an English cathedral may also be surmounted by an enormous tower at the crossing . Smaller churches usually have just one tower , but this may also be the case at larger buildings , such as Salisbury Cathedral or Ulm Minster , which has the tallest spire in the world , slightly exceeding that of Lincoln Cathedral , the tallest which was actually completed during the medieval period , at 160 metres ( 520 ft ) .
Proponents of affirmative action recognize that the policy is inherently unequal ; however , minding the inescapable fact that historic inequalities exist in America , they believe the policy is much more fair than one in which these circumstances are not taken into account . Furthermore , those in favor of affirmative action see it as an effort towards inclusion rather than a discriminatory practice . " Job discrimination is grounded in prejudice and exclusion , whereas affirmative action is an effort to overcome prejudicial treatment through inclusion . The most effective way to cure society of exclusionary practices is to make special efforts at inclusion , which is exactly what affirmative action does . "
General Francisco Franco — himself a Galician from Ferrol — ruled as dictator from the civil war until his death in 1975 . Franco 's centralizing regime suppressed any official use of the Galician language , including the use of Galician names for newborns , although its everyday oral use was not forbidden . Among the attempts at resistance were small leftist guerrilla groups such as those led by José Castro Veiga ( " El Piloto " ) and Benigno Andrade ( " Foucellas " ) , both of whom were ultimately captured and executed . In the 1960s , ministers such as Manuel Fraga Iribarne introduced some reforms allowing technocrats affiliated with Opus Dei to modernize administration in a way that facilitated capitalist economic development . However , for decades Galicia was largely confined to the role of a supplier of raw materials and energy to the rest of Spain , causing environmental havoc and leading to a wave of migration to Venezuela and to various parts of Europe . Fenosa , the monopolistic supplier of electricity , built hydroelectric dams , flooding many Galician river valleys .
On Sentinel Peak ( also known as " 'A ' Mountain " ) , just west of downtown , there is a giant " A " in honor of the University of Arizona . Starting in about 1916 , a yearly tradition developed for freshmen to whitewash the " A " , which was visible for miles . However , at the beginning of the Iraq War , anti-war activists painted it black . This was followed by a paint scuffle where the " A " was painted various colors until the city council intervened . It is now red , white and blue except when it is white or another color decided by a biennial election . Because of the three-color paint scheme often used , the shape of the A can be vague and indistinguishable from the rest of the peak . The top of Sentinel Peak , which is accessible by road , offers an outstanding scenic view of the city looking eastward . A parking lot located near the summit of Sentinel Peak was formerly a popular place to watch sunsets or view the city lights at night .
The emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon . Emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy . The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics . Under certain conditions , it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria , while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug . For example , antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the Luria–Delbrück experiment . Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin , which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains , have become less effective , due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains .
The archipelago is formed by high points on the rim of the caldera of a submarine volcano that forms a seamount . The volcano is one part of a range that was formed as part of the same process that formed the floor of the Atlantic , and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge . The top of the seamount has gone through periods of complete submergence , during which its limestone cap was formed by marine organisms , and during the Ice Ages the entire caldera was above sea level , forming an island of approximately two hundred square miles .
The climate of Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation to form . A combination of freezing temperatures , poor soil quality , lack of moisture , and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth . As a result , the diversity of plant life is very low and limited in distribution . The flora of the continent largely consists of bryophytes . There are about 100 species of mosses and 25 species of liverworts , but only three species of flowering plants , all of which are found in the Antarctic Peninsula : Deschampsia antarctica ( Antarctic hair grass ) , Colobanthus quitensis ( Antarctic pearlwort ) and the non-native Poa annua ( annual bluegrass ) . Growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer .
The power of parliament to pass bills was often thwarted by monarchs . Charles I dissolved parliament in 1629 , after it passed motions critical of and bills seeking to restrict his arbitrary exercise of power . During the eleven years of personal rule that followed , Charles performed legally dubious actions , such as raising taxes without parliament 's approval . After the English Civil War , it was accepted that parliament should be summoned to meet regularly , but it was still commonplace for monarchs to refuse royal assent to bills . In 1678 , Charles II withheld his assent from a bill " for preserving the Peace of the Kingdom by raising the Militia , and continuing them in Duty for Two and Forty Days , " suggesting that he , not parliament , should control the militia . The last Stuart monarch , Anne , similarly withheld on 11 March 1708 , on the advice of her ministers , her assent from a bill for the settling of Militia in Scotland . No monarch has since withheld royal assent on a bill passed by the British parliament .
In 1637 a small party of Puritans reconnoitered the New Haven harbor area and wintered over . In April 1638 , the main party of five hundred Puritans who left the Massachusetts Bay Colony under the leadership of the Reverend John Davenport and the London merchant Theophilus Eaton sailed into the harbor . These settlers were hoping to establish a ( in their mind ) better theological community , with the government more closely linked to the church than the one they left in Massachusetts and sought to take advantage of the excellent port capabilities of the harbor . The Quinnipiacs , who were under attack by neighboring Pequots , sold their land to the settlers in return for protection .
In 2003 , it was reported that one third of female academics " believe that discrimination or bullying by managers has held back their careers " . It was said then that " A spokesman for Imperial said the college was acting on the recommendations and had already made changes " . Nevertheless , allegations of bullying have continued : in 2007 , concerns were raised about the methods that were being used to fire people in the Faculty of Medicine . New President of Imperial College , Alice Gast says she sees bright lights in the horizon for female careers at Imperial College London .
High school football teams frequently participate in controlled scrimmages with other teams during preseason practice , but exhibition games are rare because of league rules and concerns about finances , travel and player injuries , along with enrollments not being registered until the early part of August in most school districts under the traditional September–June academic term . A more common exhibition is the high school football all-star game , which brings together top players from a region . These games are typically played by graduating seniors during the summer or at the end of the season . Many of these games , which include the U.S. Army All-American Bowl and Under Armour All-America Game , are used as showcases for players to be seen by colleges .
The Xeer legal system is assumed to have developed exclusively in the Horn of Africa since approximately the 7th century . There is no evidence that it developed elsewhere or was greatly influenced by any foreign legal system . The fact that Somali legal terminology is practically devoid of loan words from foreign languages suggests that Xeer is truly indigenous .
Mercury has been smelted from cinnabar for thousands of years . Mercury dissolves many metals , such as gold , silver , and tin , to form amalgams ( an alloy in a soft paste , or liquid form at ambient temperature ) . Amalgams have been used since 200 BC in China for plating objects with precious metals , called gilding , such as armor and mirrors . The ancient Romans often used mercury-tin amalgams for gilding their armor . The amalgam was applied as a paste and then heated until the mercury vaporized , leaving the gold , silver , or tin behind . Mercury was often used in mining , to extract precious metals like gold and silver from their ores .
The primary site of infection in the lungs , known as the " Ghon focus " , is generally located in either the upper part of the lower lobe , or the lower part of the upper lobe . Tuberculosis of the lungs may also occur via infection from the blood stream . This is known as a Simon focus and is typically found in the top of the lung . This hematogenous transmission can also spread infection to more distant sites , such as peripheral lymph nodes , the kidneys , the brain , and the bones . All parts of the body can be affected by the disease , though for unknown reasons it rarely affects the heart , skeletal muscles , pancreas , or thyroid .
Adolescence is a period frequently marked by increased rights and privileges for individuals . While cultural variation exists for legal rights and their corresponding ages , considerable consistency is found across cultures . Furthermore , since the advent of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 ( children here defined as under 18 ) , almost every country in the world ( except the U.S. and South Sudan ) has legally committed to advancing an anti-discriminatory stance towards young people of all ages . This includes protecting children against unchecked child labor , enrollment in the military , prostitution , and pornography . In many societies , those who reach a certain age ( often 18 , though this varies ) are considered to have reached the age of majority and are legally regarded as adults who are responsible for their actions . People below this age are considered minors or children . A person below the age of majority may gain adult rights through legal emancipation .
William Champion 's brother , John , patented a process in 1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process . Prior to this , only calamine could be used to produce zinc . In 1798 , Johann Christian Ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter . Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium , which processed even more zinc . Italian doctor Luigi Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog 's leg to twitch . He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect " animal electricity " . The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani and these discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries , galvanization and cathodic protection .
The worship of dynastic ruler cults was also a feature of this period , most notably in Egypt , where the Ptolemies adopted earlier Pharaonic practice , and established themselves as god-kings . These cults were usually associated with a specific temple in honor of the ruler such as the Ptolemaieia at Alexandria and had their own festivals and theatrical performances . The setting up of ruler cults was more based on the systematized honors offered to the kings ( sacrifice , proskynesis , statues , altars , hymns ) which put them on par with the gods ( isotheism ) than on actual belief of their divine nature . According to Peter Green , these cults did not produce genuine belief of the divinity of rulers among the Greeks and Macedonians . The worship of Alexander was also popular , as in the long lived cult at Erythrae and of course , at Alexandria , where his tomb was located .
Numerous live performance events dedicated to house music were founded during the course of the decade , including Shambhala Music Festival and major industry sponsored events like Miami 's Winter Music Conference . The genre even gained popularity in the Middle East in cities such as Dubai & Abu Dhabi [ citation needed ] and at events like Creamfields .
In the 11th century , the Seljuk Turks took over much of the Middle East , occupying Persia during the 1040s , Armenia in the 1060s , and Jerusalem in 1070 . In 1071 , the Turkish army defeated the Byzantine army at the Battle of Manzikert and captured the Byzantine Emperor Romanus IV ( r. 1068–71 ) . The Turks were then free to invade Asia Minor , which dealt a dangerous blow to the Byzantine Empire by seizing a large part of its population and its economic heartland . Although the Byzantines regrouped and recovered somewhat , they never fully regained Asia Minor and were often on the defensive . The Turks also had difficulties , losing control of Jerusalem to the Fatimids of Egypt and suffering from a series of internal civil wars . The Byzantines also faced a revived Bulgaria , which in the late 12th and 13th centuries spread throughout the Balkans .
After their adoption , treaties as well as their amendments have to follow the official legal procedures of the United Nations , as applied by the Office of Legal Affairs , including signature , ratification and entry into force .
Differences in pain perception and tolerance thresholds are associated with , among other factors , ethnicity , genetics , and sex . People of Mediterranean origin report as painful some radiant heat intensities that northern Europeans describe as nonpainful . And Italian women tolerate less intense electric shock than Jewish or Native American women . Some individuals in all cultures have significantly higher than normal pain perception and tolerance thresholds . For instance , patients who experience painless heart attacks have higher pain thresholds for electric shock , muscle cramp and heat .
Madonna 's emergence occurred during the advent of MTV ; Chris Nelson from The New York Times spoke of pop artists like Madonna saying , " MTV , with its almost exclusively lip-synched videos , ushered in an era in which average music fans might happily spend hours a day , every day , watching singers just mouth the words . " The symbiotic relationship between the music video and lip-syncing led to a desire for the spectacle and imagery of the music video to be transferred to live stage shows . He added , " Artists like Madonna and Janet Jackson set new standards for showmanship , with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing . These effects came at the expense of live singing . " Thor Christensen of The Dallas Morning News commented that while Madonna earned a reputation for lip-syncing during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour , she has subsequently reorganized her performances by " stay [ ing ] mostly still during her toughest singing parts and [ leaves ] the dance routines to her backup troupe ... [ r ] ather than try to croon and dance up a storm at the same time . "
On September 13 , 2009 , during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards while Taylor Swift was accepting her award for Best Female Video for " You Belong with Me " , West went on stage and grabbed the microphone to proclaim that Beyoncé 's video for " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) " , nominated for the same award , was " one of the best videos of all time " . He was subsequently removed from the remainder of the show for his actions . When Beyoncé later won the award for Best Video of the Year for " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) " , she called Swift up on stage so that she could finish her acceptance speech . West was criticized by various celebrities for the outburst , and by President Barack Obama , who called West a " jackass " . In addition , West 's VMA disruption sparked a large influx of Internet photo memes with blogs , forums and " tweets " with the " Let you finish " photo-jokes . He posted a Tweet soon after the event where he stated , " Everybody wan na booooo me but I 'm a fan of real pop culture ... I 'm not crazy y'all , I 'm just real . " He then posted two apologies for the outburst on his personal blog ; one on the night of the incident , and the other the following day , when he also apologized during an appearance on The Jay Leno Show . After Swift appeared on The View two days after the outburst , partly to discuss the matter , West called her to apologize personally . Swift said she accepted his apology .
Sichuan was China 's most populous province before Chongqing became a directly-controlled municipality ; it is currently the fourth most populous , after Guangdong , Shandong and Henan . As of 1832 , Sichuan was the most populous of the 18 provinces in China , with an estimated population at that time of 21 million . It was the third most populous sub-national entity in the world , after Uttar Pradesh , India and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic until 1991 , when the Soviet Union was dissolved . It is also one of the only six to ever reach 100 million people ( Uttar Pradesh , Russian RSFSR , Maharashtra , Sichuan , Bihar and Punjab ) . It is currently 10th .
In 1945 , the first formal women 's barbershop organization , Sweet Adelines , was formed . In 1953 Sweet Adelines became an international organization , although it did n't change its name to Sweet Adelines International until 1991 . The membership of nearly 25,000 women , all singing in English , includes choruses in most of the fifty United States as well as in Australia , Canada , England , Finland , Germany , Ireland , Japan , New Zealand , Scotland , Sweden , Wales and the Netherlands . Headquartered in Tulsa , Oklahoma , the organization encompasses more than 1,200 registered quartets and 600 choruses .
The Germanic superstrate has had different outcomes in Spanish and Catalan . For example , Catalan fang " mud " and rostir " to roast " , of Germanic origin , contrast with Spanish lodo and asar , of Latin origin ; whereas Catalan filosa " spinning wheel " and pols " temple " , of Latin origin , contrast with Spanish rueca and sien , of Germanic origin .
Rurik led the Rus ' until his death in about 879 , bequeathing his kingdom to his kinsman , Prince Oleg , as regent for his young son , Igor . In 880-82 , Oleg led a military force south along the Dnieper river , capturing Smolensk and Lyubech before reaching Kiev , where he deposed and killed Askold and Dir , proclaimed himself prince , and declared Kiev the " mother of Rus ' cities . " Oleg set about consolidating his power over the surrounding region and the riverways north to Novgorod , imposing tribute on the East Slav tribes . In 883 , he conquered the Drevlians , imposing a fur tribute on them . By 885 he had subjugated the Poliane , Severiane , Vyatichi , and Radimichs , forbidding them to pay further tribute to the Khazars . Oleg continued to develop and expand a network of Rus ' forts in Slav lands , begun by Rurik in the north .
The oldest rocks in the group are in the north west of Scotland , Ireland and North Wales and are 2,700 million years old . During the Silurian period the north-western regions collided with the south-east , which had been part of a separate continental landmass . The topography of the islands is modest in scale by global standards . Ben Nevis rises to an elevation of only 1,344 metres ( 4,409 ft ) , and Lough Neagh , which is notably larger than other lakes on the isles , covers 390 square kilometres ( 151 sq mi ) . The climate is temperate marine , with mild winters and warm summers . The North Atlantic Drift brings significant moisture and raises temperatures 11 °C ( 20 °F ) above the global average for the latitude . This led to a landscape which was long dominated by temperate rainforest , although human activity has since cleared the vast majority of forest cover . The region was re-inhabited after the last glacial period of Quaternary glaciation , by 12,000 BC when Great Britain was still a peninsula of the European continent . Ireland , which became an island by 12,000 BC , was not inhabited until after 8000 BC . Great Britain became an island by 5600 BC .
Apple 's HyperCard scripting language provided Macintosh computer users with a means to design databases of slides , animation , video and sounds from LaserDiscs and then to create interfaces for users to play specific content from the disc through software called LaserStacks . User-created " stacks " were shared and were especially popular in education where teacher-generated stacks were used to access discs ranging from art collections to basic biological processes . Commercially available stacks were also popular with the Voyager company being possibly the most successful distributor .
Dell announced a change campaign called " Dell 2.0 , " reducing the number of employees and diversifying the company 's products . While chairman of the board after relinquishing his CEO position , Michael Dell still had significant input in the company during Rollins ' years as CEO . With the return of Michael Dell as CEO , the company saw immediate changes in operations , the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new personnel brought in from outside the company . Michael Dell announced a number of initiatives and plans ( part of the " Dell 2.0 " initiative ) to improve the company 's financial performance . These include elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards , reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Michael Dell from 20 to 12 , and reduction of " bureaucracy " . Jim Schneider retired as CFO and was replaced by Donald Carty , as the company came under an SEC probe for its accounting practices .
During Andrés López Obrador 's administration a political slogan was introduced : la Ciudad de la Esperanza ( " The City of Hope " ) . This motto was quickly adopted as a city nickname , but has faded since the new motto Capital en Movimiento ( " Capital in Movement " ) was adopted by the administration headed by Marcelo Ebrard , though the latter is not treated as often as a nickname in media . Since 2013 , to refer to the City particularly in relation to government campaigns , the abbreviation CDMX has been used ( from Ciudad de México ) .
As the years went by , the three feudal lords and their extensive territories became increasingly autonomous . Finally , in 1673 , Shang Kexi petitioned Kangxi for permission to retire to his hometown in Liaodong province and nominated his son as his successor . The young emperor granted his retirement , but denied the heredity of his fief . In reaction , the two other generals decided to petition for their own retirements to test Kangxi 's resolve , thinking that he would not risk offending them . The move backfired as the young emperor called their bluff by accepting their requests and ordering that all three fiefdoms to be reverted to the crown .
Temperature extremes are moderated by the adjacent Puget Sound , greater Pacific Ocean , and Lake Washington . The region is largely shielded from Pacific storms by the Olympic Mountains and from Arctic air by the Cascade Range . Despite being on the margin of the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains , the city has a reputation for frequent rain . This reputation stems from the frequency of light precipitation in the fall , winter , and spring . In an average year , at least 0.01 inches ( 0.25 mm ) of precipitation falls on 150 days , more than nearly all U.S. cities east of the Rocky Mountains . It is cloudy 201 days out of the year and partly cloudy 93 days . Official weather and climatic data is collected at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport , located about 19 km ( 12 mi ) south of downtown in the city of SeaTac , which is at a higher elevation , and records more cloudy days and fewer partly cloudy days per year .
Above the main portal there is generally a large window , like that at York Minster , or a group of windows such as those at Ripon Cathedral . In France there is generally a rose window like that at Reims Cathedral . Rose windows are also often found in the façades of churches of Spain and Italy , but are rarer elsewhere and are not found on the façades of any English Cathedrals . The gable is usually richly decorated with arcading or sculpture or , in the case of Italy , may be decorated with the rest of the façade , with polychrome marble and mosaic , as at Orvieto Cathedral .
The use of the term for the Iranian language family was introduced in 1836 by Christian Lassen . Robert Needham Cust used the term Irano-Aryan in 1878 , and Orientalists such as George Abraham Grierson and Max Müller contrasted Irano-Aryan ( Iranian ) and Indo-Aryan ( Indic ) . Some recent scholarship , primarily in German , has revived this convention .
An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005 , after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before , but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season . UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League , giving England five qualifiers . UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing . However , for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League , this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league , it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league . No association can have more than four entrants in the Champions League . This occurred in 2012 , when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League the previous year , but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur , who went into the Europa League .
Current circulating in one antenna generally induces a voltage across the feedpoint of nearby antennas or antenna elements . The mathematics presented below are useful in analyzing the electrical behaviour of antenna arrays , where the properties of the individual array elements ( such as half wave dipoles ) are already known . If those elements were widely separated and driven in a certain amplitude and phase , then each would act independently as that element is known to . However , because of the mutual interaction between their electric and magnetic fields due to proximity , the currents in each element are not simply a function of the applied voltage ( according to its driving point impedance ) , but depend on the currents in the other nearby elements . Note that this now is a near field phenomenon which could not be properly accounted for using the Friis transmission equation for instance .
The European powers recognized the islands as part of the Spanish East Indies in 1874 . However , Spain sold the islands to the German Empire in 1884 , and they became part of German New Guinea in 1885 . In World War I the Empire of Japan occupied the Marshall Islands , which in 1919 the League of Nations combined with other former German territories to form the South Pacific Mandate . In World War II , the United States conquered the islands in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign . Along with other Pacific Islands , the Marshall Islands were then consolidated into the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands governed by the US . Self-government was achieved in 1979 , and full sovereignty in 1986 , under a Compact of Free Association with the United States . Marshall Islands has been a United Nations member state since 1991 .
Many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their bills in their back feathers , although others place their beaks among their breast feathers . Many birds rest on one leg , while some may pull up their legs into their feathers , especially in cold weather . Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep . Many ground birds , such as quails and pheasants , roost in trees . A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down . Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates . This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species , including owlet-nightjars , nightjars , and woodswallows . One species , the common poorwill , even enters a state of hibernation . Birds do not have sweat glands , but they may cool themselves by moving to shade , standing in water , panting , increasing their surface area , fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves .
Other mammals found in Greater London are hedgehogs , rats , mice , rabbit , shrew , vole , and squirrels , In wilder areas of Outer London , such as Epping Forest , a wide variety of mammals are found including hare , badger , field , bank and water vole , wood mouse , yellow-necked mouse , mole , shrew , and weasel , in addition to fox , squirrel and hedgehog . A dead otter was found at The Highway , in Wapping , about a mile from the Tower Bridge , which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city . Ten of England 's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest : soprano , nathusius and common pipistrelles , noctule , serotine , barbastelle , daubenton 's , brown Long-eared , natterer 's and leisler 's .
There are four hundred securities listed on the stock exchange , of which almost three hundred are offshore funds and alternative investment structures attracted by Bermuda 's regulatory environment . The Exchange specialises in listing and trading of capital market instruments such as equities , debt issues , funds ( including hedge fund structures ) and depository receipt programmes . The BSX is a full member of the World Federation of Exchanges and is located in an OECD member nation . It also has Approved Stock Exchange status under Australia 's Foreign Investment Fund ( FIF ) taxation rules and Designated Investment Exchange status by the UK 's Financial Services Authority .
Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon supply chain efficiencies to sell established technologies at low prices , instead of being an innovator . By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector . Dell 's low spending on R & D relative to its revenue ( compared to IBM , Hewlett Packard , and Apple Inc. ) —which worked well in the commoditized PC market—prevented it from making inroads into more lucrative segments , such as MP3 players and later mobile devices . Increasing spending on R & D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized . Dell had done well with a horizontal organization that focused on PCs when the computing industry moved to horizontal mix-and-match layers in the 1980s , but by the mid-2000 the industry shifted to vertically integrated stacks to deliver complete IT solutions and Dell lagged far behind competitors like Hewlett Packard and Oracle .
The prognosis for asthma is generally good , especially for children with mild disease . Mortality has decreased over the last few decades due to better recognition and improvement in care . Globally it causes moderate or severe disability in 19.4 million people as of 2004 ( 16 million of which are in low and middle income countries ) . Of asthma diagnosed during childhood , half of cases will no longer carry the diagnosis after a decade . Airway remodeling is observed , but it is unknown whether these represent harmful or beneficial changes . Early treatment with corticosteroids seems to prevent or ameliorates a decline in lung function .
One question that is crucial in cognitive neuroscience is how information and mental experiences are coded and represented in the brain . Scientists have gained much knowledge about the neuronal codes from the studies of plasticity , but most of such research has been focused on simple learning in simple neuronal circuits ; it is considerably less clear about the neuronal changes involved in more complex examples of memory , particularly declarative memory that requires the storage of facts and events ( Byrne 2007 ) . Convergence-divergence zones might be the neural networks where memories are stored and retrieved .
Available modes of transport are by road , sea and air . Of the 10,663 km ( 6,626 mi ) of roads in the Republic of Cyprus in 1998 , 6,249 km ( 3,883 mi ) were paved , and 4,414 km ( 2,743 mi ) were unpaved . In 1996 the Turkish-occupied area had a similar ratio of paved to unpaved , with approximately 1,370 km ( 850 mi ) of paved road and 980 km ( 610 mi ) unpaved . [ citation needed ] Cyprus is one of only four EU nations in which vehicles drive on the left-hand side of the road , a remnant of British colonisation ( the others being Ireland , Malta and the United Kingdom ) . A series of motorways runs along the coast from Paphos east to Ayia Napa , with two motorways running inland to Nicosia , one from Limassol and one from Larnaca .
Ye Zhiping , the principal of Sangzao Middle School in Sangzao , one of the largest in An County , has been credited with proactive action that spared the lives of all 2,323 pupils in attendance when the earthquake happened . During a three-year period that ended in 2007 , he oversaw a major overhaul of his school . During that time he obtained more than 400,000 yuan ( US $ 60,000 ) from the county education department , money used to widen and strengthen concrete pillars and the balcony railing of all four storeys of his school , as well as secure its concrete floors .
The first lighting used on an airport was during the latter part of the 1920s ; in the 1930s approach lighting came into use . These indicated the proper direction and angle of descent . The colours and flash intervals of these lights became standardized under the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) . In the 1940s , the slope-line approach system was introduced . This consisted of two rows of lights that formed a funnel indicating an aircraft 's position on the glideslope . Additional lights indicated incorrect altitude and direction .
In 2010 , bills to abolish the death penalty in Kansas and in South Dakota ( which had a de facto moratorium at the time ) were rejected . Idaho ended its de facto moratorium , during which only one volunteer had been executed , on November 18 , 2011 by executing Paul Ezra Rhoades ; South Dakota executed Donald Moeller on October 30 , 2012 , ending a de facto moratorium during which only two volunteers had been executed . Of the 12 prisoners whom Nevada has executed since 1976 , 11 waived their rights to appeal . Kentucky and Montana have executed two prisoners against their will ( KY : 1997 and 1999 , MT : 1995 and 1998 ) and one volunteer , respectively ( KY : 2008 , MT : 2006 ) . Colorado ( in 1997 ) and Wyoming ( in 1992 ) have executed only one prisoner , respectively .
For the King 's funeral , people dress in elaborate mourning costume , many of them cross-dressing men who carry bouquets of phallic vegetables . In the funeral house , the body of the King is surrounded by an honor guard and weeping concubines , crying over the loss of sexual pleasure brought about by his death . The King 's body is carried to the Plaça de la Vila where a satiric eulogy is delivered while the townspeople eat salty grilled sardines with bread and wine , suggesting the symbolic cannibalism of the communion ritual . Finally , amid rockets and explosions , the King 's body is burned in a massive pyre .
High-altitude clouds on Neptune have been observed casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below . There are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitude . These circumferential bands have widths of 50–150 km and lie about 50–110 km above the cloud deck . These altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs , the troposphere . Weather does not occur in the higher stratosphere or thermosphere . Unlike Uranus , Neptune 's composition has a higher volume of ocean , whereas Uranus has a smaller mantle .
Sure South Atlantic Ltd ( " Sure " ) offers television for the island via 17 analogue terrestrial UHF channels , offering a mix of British , US , and South African programming .

The feed signal , from MultiChoice DStv in South Africa , is received by a satellite dish at Bryant 's Beacon from Intelsat 7 in the Ku band .
Logan Airport , located in East Boston and operated by the Massachusetts Port Authority ( Massport ) , is Boston 's principal airport . Nearby general aviation airports are Beverly Municipal Airport to the north , Hanscom Field to the west , and Norwood Memorial Airport to the south . Massport also operates several major facilities within the Port of Boston , including a cruise ship terminal and facilities to handle bulk and container cargo in South Boston , and other facilities in Charlestown and East Boston .
In 1979 , the U.S. placed Libya on its list of " State Sponsors of Terrorism " , while at the end of the year a demonstration torched the U.S. embassy in Tripoli in solidarity with the perpetrators of the Iran hostage crisis . The following year , Libyan fighters began intercepting U.S. fighter jets flying over the Mediterranean , signalling the collapse of relations between the two countries . Libyan relations with Lebanon and Shi'ite communities across the world also deteriorated due to the August 1978 disappearance of imam Musa al-Sadr when visiting Libya ; the Lebanese accused Gaddafi of having him killed or imprisoned , a charge he denied . Relations with Syria improved , as Gaddafi and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad shared an enmity with Israel and Egypt 's Sadat . In 1980 , they proposed a political union , with Libya paying off Syria 's £1 billion debt to the Soviet Union ; although pressures led Assad to pull out , they remained allies . Another key ally was Uganda , and in 1979 , Gaddafi sent 2,500 troops into Uganda to defend the regime of President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders . The mission failed ; 400 Libyans were killed and they were forced to retreat . Gaddafi later came to regret his alliance with Amin , openly criticising him .
To relieve pressure from the expected German attack into Alsace-Lorraine , Napoleon III and the French high command planned a seaborne invasion of northern Germany as soon as war began . The French expected the invasion to divert German troops and to encourage Denmark to join in the war , with its 50,000-strong army and the Royal Danish Navy . It was discovered that Prussia had recently built defences around the big North German ports , including coastal artillery batteries with Krupp heavy artillery , which with a range of 4,000 yards ( 3,700 m ) , had double the range of French naval guns . The French Navy lacked the heavy guns to engage the coastal defences and the topography of the Prussian coast made a seaborne invasion of northern Germany impossible .
Biographers Blundy and Lycett believed that he was " a populist at heart . " Throughout Libya , crowds of supporters would turn up to public events at which he appeared ; described as " spontaneous demonstrations " by the government , there are recorded instances of groups being coerced or paid to attend . He was typically late to public events , and would sometimes not show up at all . Although Bianco thought he had a " gift for oratory " , he was considered a poor orator by biographers Blundy and Lycett . Biographer Daniel Kawczynski noted that Gaddafi was famed for his " lengthy , wandering " speeches , which typically involved criticising Israel and the U.S .
Impermanence ( Pāli : anicca ) expresses the Buddhist notion that all compounded or conditioned phenomena ( all things and experiences ) are inconstant , unsteady , and impermanent . Everything we can experience through our senses is made up of parts , and its existence is dependent on external conditions . Everything is in constant flux , and so conditions and the thing itself are constantly changing . Things are constantly coming into being , and ceasing to be . Since nothing lasts , there is no inherent or fixed nature to any object or experience . According to the doctrine of impermanence , life embodies this flux in the aging process , the cycle of rebirth ( saṃsāra ) , and in any experience of loss . The doctrine asserts that because things are impermanent , attachment to them is futile and leads to suffering ( dukkha ) .
Paleoptera and Neoptera are the winged orders of insects differentiated by the presence of hardened body parts called sclerites , and in the Neoptera , muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen . Neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis-based ( Polyneoptera and Paraneoptera ) and complete metamorphosis-based groups . It has proved difficult to clarify the relationships between the orders in Polyneoptera because of constant new findings calling for revision of the taxa . For example , the Paraneoptera have turned out to be more closely related to the Endopterygota than to the rest of the Exopterygota . The recent molecular finding that the traditional louse orders Mallophaga and Anoplura are derived from within Psocoptera has led to the new taxon Psocodea . Phasmatodea and Embiidina have been suggested to form the Eukinolabia . Mantodea , Blattodea , and Isoptera are thought to form a monophyletic group termed Dictyoptera .
At the dawn of the Grand Lodge era , during the 1720s , James Anderson composed the first printed constitutions for Freemasons , the basis for most subsequent constitutions , which specifically excluded women from Freemasonry . As Freemasonry spread , continental masons began to include their ladies in Lodges of Adoption , which worked three degrees with the same names as the men 's but different content . The French officially abandoned the experiment in the early 19th century . Later organisations with a similar aim emerged in the United States , but distinguished the names of the degrees from those of male masonry .
Scholars and historians are divided as to what event signals the end of the Hellenistic era . The Hellenistic period may be seen to end either with the final conquest of the Greek heartlands by Rome in 146 BC following the Achean War , with the final defeat of the Ptolemaic Kingdom at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC , or even the move by Roman emperor Constantine the Great of the capital of the Roman Empire to Constantinople in 330 AD . " Hellenistic " is distinguished from " Hellenic " in that the first encompasses the entire sphere of direct ancient Greek influence , while the latter refers to Greece itself .
Discussions of strategy in the mid Ming dynasty focused primarily on recovery of the Ordos region , which the Mongols used as a rallying base to stage raids into Ming China . Norbu states that the Ming dynasty , preoccupied with the Mongol threat to the north , could not spare additional armed forces to enforce or back up their claim of sovereignty over Tibet ; instead , they relied on " Confucian instruments of tribute relations " of heaping unlimited number of titles and gifts on Tibetan lamas through acts of diplomacy . Sperling states that the delicate relationship between the Ming and Tibet was " the last time a united China had to deal with an independent Tibet , " that there was a potential for armed conflict at their borders , and that the ultimate goal of Ming foreign policy with Tibet was not subjugation but " avoidance of any kind of Tibetan threat . " P. Christiaan Klieger argues that the Ming court 's patronage of high Tibetan lamas " was designed to help stabilize border regions and protect trade routes . "
In February 2016 , over a hundred thousand people signed a petition in just twenty-four hours , calling for a boycott of Sony Music and all other Sony-affiliated businesses after rape allegations against music producer Dr. Luke were made by musical artist Kesha . Kesha asked a New York City Supreme Court to free her from her contract with Sony Music but the court denied the request , prompting widespread public and media response .
The Philippines is a unitary state with some powers devolved to Local Government Units ( LGUs ) under the terms of the Local Government Code . There is also one autonomous region , the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao . Over the years various modifications have been proposed to the Constitution of the Philippines , including possible transition to a federal system as part of a shift to a parliamentary system . In 2004 , Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo established the Consultative Commission which suggested such a Charter Change but no action was taken by the Philippine Congress to amend the 1987 Constitution .
In the China Digital Times an article reports a close analysis by an alleged Chinese construction engineer known online as “Book Blade” ( 书剑子 ) , who stated :
Napoleon institutionalised plunder of conquered territories : French museums contain art stolen by Napoleon 's forces from across Europe . Artefacts were brought to the Musée du Louvre for a grand central museum ; his example would later serve as inspiration for more notorious imitators . He was compared to Adolf Hitler most famously by the historian Pieter Geyl in 1947 and Claude Ribbe in 2005 . David G. Chandler , a foremost historian of Napoleonic warfare , wrote in 1973 that , " Nothing could be more degrading to the former [ Napoleon ] and more flattering to the latter [ Hitler ] . The comparison is odious . On the whole Napoleon was inspired by a noble dream , wholly dissimilar from Hitler 's ... Napoleon left great and lasting testimonies to his genius—in codes of law and national identities which survive to the present day . Adolf Hitler left nothing but destruction . "
The Boston Globe wrote that " if there 's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation 's top national leaders over the past three decades , it 's Yale . " Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. Presidential election between 1972 and 2004 . Yale-educated Presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford , George H.W . Bush , Bill Clinton , and George W. Bush , and major-party nominees during this period include John Kerry ( 2004 ) , Joseph Lieberman ( Vice President , 2000 ) , and Sargent Shriver ( Vice President , 1972 ) . Other Yale alumni who made serious bids for the Presidency during this period include Hillary Clinton ( 2008 ) , Howard Dean ( 2004 ) , Gary Hart ( 1984 and 1988 ) , Paul Tsongas ( 1992 ) , Pat Robertson ( 1988 ) and Jerry Brown ( 1976 , 1980 , 1992 ) .
Combining statements in the canonical Gospels produces the following account : Jesus was arrested in Gethsemane following the Last Supper with the Twelve Apostles , and then stood trial before the Sanhedrin ( a Jewish judicial body ) , Pontius Pilate ( a Roman authority in Judaea ) , and Herod Antipas ( king of Judea , appointed by Rome ) , before being handed over for crucifixion by the chief priests of the Jews . After being flogged , Jesus was mocked by Roman soldiers as the " King of the Jews " , clothed in a purple robe , crowned with thorns , beaten and spat on . Jesus then had to make his way to the place of his crucifixion .
The attacks on the torch in London and Paris were described as " despicable " by the Chinese government , condemning them as " deliberate disruptions ... who gave no thought to the Olympic spirit or the laws of Britain and France " and who " tarnish the lofty Olympic spirit " , and vowed they would continue with the relay and not allow the protests to " impede the Olympic spirit " . Large-scale counter-protests by overseas Chinese and foreign-based Chinese nationals became prevalent in later segments of the relay . In San Francisco , the number of supporters were much more than the number of protesters , and in Australia , Japan , South Korea , the counter-protesters overwhelmed the protesters . A couple of skirmishes between the protesters and supporters were reported . No major protests were visible in the Latin America , Africa , and Western Asia legs of the torch relay .
West is one of the best-selling artists of all time , having sold more than 32 million albums and 100 million digital downloads worldwide . He has won a total of 21 Grammy Awards , making him one of the most awarded artists of all time and the most Grammy-awarded artist of his age . Three of his albums rank on Rolling Stone 's 2012 " 500 Greatest Albums of All Time " list ; two of his albums feature at first and eighth , respectively , in Pitchfork Media 's The 100 Best Albums of 2010–2014 . He has also been included in a number of Forbes annual lists . Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015 .
On 27 June 1950 , two days after the KPA invaded and three months before the Chinese entered the war , President Truman dispatched the United States Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait , to prevent hostilities between the Nationalist Republic of China ( Taiwan ) and the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) . On 4 August 1950 , with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted , Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People 's Liberation Army 's ( PLA ) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force . China justified its entry into the war as a response to " American aggression in the guise of the UN " .
On 25 February 1757 , Burke signed a contract with Robert Dodsley to write a " history of England from the time of Julius Caesar to the end of the reign of Queen Anne " , its length being eighty quarto sheets ( 640 pages ) , nearly 400,000 words . It was to be submitted for publication by Christmas 1758 . Burke completed the work to the year 1216 and stopped ; it was not published until after Burke 's death , being included in an 1812 collection of his works , entitled An Essay Towards an Abridgement of the English History . G. M. Young did not value Burke 's history and claimed that it was " demonstrably a translation from the French " . Lord Acton , on commenting on the story that Burke stopped his history because David Hume published his , said " it is ever to be regretted that the reverse did not occur " .
Burrel 's innovative design , which combined the low production cost of an Apple II with the computing power of Lisa 's CPU , the Motorola 68K , received the attention of Steve Jobs , co-founder of Apple . Realizing that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa , he began to focus his attention on the project . Raskin left the team in 1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs . Team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final Macintosh design is closer to Jobs ' ideas than Raskin 's . After hearing of the pioneering GUI technology being developed at Xerox PARC , Jobs had negotiated a visit to see the Xerox Alto computer and its Smalltalk development tools in exchange for Apple stock options . The Lisa and Macintosh user interfaces were influenced by technology seen at Xerox PARC and were combined with the Macintosh group 's own ideas . Jobs also commissioned industrial designer Hartmut Esslinger to work on the Macintosh line , resulting in the " Snow White " design language ; although it came too late for the earliest Macs , it was implemented in most other mid- to late-1980s Apple computers . However , Jobs ' leadership at the Macintosh project did not last ; after an internal power struggle with new CEO John Sculley , Jobs resigned from Apple in 1985 . He went on to found NeXT , another computer company targeting the education market , and did not return until 1997 , when Apple acquired NeXT .
On 15 September the Luftwaffe made two large daylight attacks on London along the Thames Estuary , targeting the docks and rail communications in the city . Its hope was to destroy its targets and draw the RAF into defending them , allowing the Luftwaffe to destroy their fighters in large numbers , thereby achieving an air superiority . Large air battles broke out , lasting for most of the day . The first attack merely damaged the rail network for three days , and the second attack failed altogether . The air battle was later commemorated by Battle of Britain Day . The Luftwaffe lost 18 percent of the bombers sent on the operations that day , and failed to gain air superiority .
The war started badly for the US and UN . North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea . However the United Nations intervened , naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces , and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan , gaining time for reinforcement . MacArthur , in a bold but risky move , ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon , cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea . As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China , the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel . Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea ; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country . MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war . Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons ; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel . North and South Korea are still today in a state of war , having never signed a peace treaty , and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy .
In 2010 , bills to abolish the death penalty in Kansas and in South Dakota ( which had a de facto moratorium at the time ) were rejected . Idaho ended its de facto moratorium , during which only one volunteer had been executed , on November 18 , 2011 by executing Paul Ezra Rhoades ; South Dakota executed Donald Moeller on October 30 , 2012 , ending a de facto moratorium during which only two volunteers had been executed . Of the 12 prisoners whom Nevada has executed since 1976 , 11 waived their rights to appeal . Kentucky and Montana have executed two prisoners against their will ( KY : 1997 and 1999 , MT : 1995 and 1998 ) and one volunteer , respectively ( KY : 2008 , MT : 2006 ) . Colorado ( in 1997 ) and Wyoming ( in 1992 ) have executed only one prisoner , respectively .
Traditionally , Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona 's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority , in stark contrast to Barça 's revolutionary spirit . Also in the 1960s and 1970s , while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia 's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life , Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen , military officers , civil servants and career fascists .
Bacteria do not have a membrane-bound nucleus , and their genetic material is typically a single circular DNA chromosome located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid . The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA . The phylum Planctomycetes and candidate phylum Poribacteria may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria , because they appear to have a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures . Like all living organisms , bacteria contain ribosomes , often grouped in chains called polyribosomes , for the production of proteins , but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and Archaea . Bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70S ( measured in Svedberg units ) : their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S . Some antibiotics bind specifically to 70S ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis . Those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger 80S ribosomes of eukaryotic cells and without harming the host .
The Tennessee income tax does not apply to salaries and wages , but most income from stock , bonds and notes receivable is taxable . All taxable dividends and interest which exceed the $ 1,250 single exemption or the $ 2,500 joint exemption are taxable at the rate of 6 % . The state 's sales and use tax rate for most items is 7 % . Food is taxed at a lower rate of 5.25 % , but candy , dietary supplements and prepared food are taxed at the full 7 % rate . Local sales taxes are collected in most jurisdictions , at rates varying from 1.5 % to 2.75 % , bringing the total sales tax to between 8.5 % and 9.75 % , one of the highest levels in the nation . Intangible property is assessed on the shares of stock of stockholders of any loan company , investment company , insurance company or for-profit cemetery companies . The assessment ratio is 40 % of the value multiplied by the tax rate for the jurisdiction . Tennessee imposes an inheritance tax on decedents ' estates that exceed maximum single exemption limits ( $ 1,000,000 for deaths in 2006 and thereafter ) .
In practice , the emphasis on strictness has resulted in the rise of " homogeneous enclaves " with other haredi Jews that are less likely to be threatened by assimilation and intermarriage , or even to interact with other Jews who do not share their doctrines . Nevertheless , this strategy has proved successful and the number of adherents to Orthodox Judaism , especially Haredi and Chassidic communities , has grown rapidly . Some scholars estimate more Jewish men are studying in yeshivot ( Talmudic schools ) and Kollelim ( post-graduate Talmudical colleges for married ( male ) students ) than at any other time in history .

In England , the 16th-century European Reformation resulted in a number of executions on charges of heresy . During the thirty-eight years of Henry VIII 's reign , about sixty heretics , mainly Protestants , were executed and a rather greater number of Catholics lost their lives on grounds of political offences such as treason , notably Sir Thomas More and Cardinal John Fisher , for refusing to accept the king 's supremacy over the Church in England . Under Edward VI , the heresy laws were repealed in 1547 only to be reintroduced in 1554 by Mary I ; even so two radicals were executed in Edward 's reign ( one for denying the reality of the incarnation , the other for denying Christ 's divinity ) . Under Mary , around two hundred and ninety people were burned at the stake between 1555 and 1558 after the restoration of papal jurisdiction . When Elizabeth I came to the throne , the concept of heresy was retained in theory but severely restricted by the 1559 Act of Supremacy and the one hundred and eighty or so Catholics who were executed in the forty-five years of her reign were put to death because they were considered members of " ... a subversive fifth column . " The last execution of a " heretic " in England occurred under James VI and I in 1612 . Although the charge was technically one of " blasphemy " there was one later execution in Scotland ( still at that date an entirely independent kingdom ) when in 1697 Thomas Aikenhead was accused , among other things , of denying the doctrine of the Trinity .
Independently of the method used to signify royal assent , it is the responsibility of the Clerk of the Parliaments , once the assent has been duly notified to both houses , not only to endorse the act in the name of the monarch with the formal Norman French formula , but to certify that assent has been granted . The clerk signs one authentic copy of the bill and inserts the date ( in English ) on which the assent was notified to the two houses after the title of the act . When an act is published , the signature of the clerk is omitted , as is the Norman French formula , should the endorsement have been made in writing . However , the date on which the assent was notified is printed in brackets .
At the homestead , Bell set up his own workshop in the converted carriage house near to what he called his " dreaming place " , a large hollow nestled in trees at the back of the property above the river . Despite his frail condition upon arriving in Canada , Bell found the climate and environs to his liking , and rapidly improved . [ N 10 ] He continued his interest in the study of the human voice and when he discovered the Six Nations Reserve across the river at Onondaga , he learned the Mohawk language and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols . For his work , Bell was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a Mohawk headdress and danced traditional dances . [ N 11 ]
By total area ( water as well as land ) , the United States is either slightly larger or smaller than the People 's Republic of China , making it the world 's third or fourth largest country . China and the United States are smaller than Russia and Canada in total area , but are larger than Brazil . By land area only ( exclusive of waters ) , the United States is the world 's third largest country , after Russia and China , with Canada in fourth . Whether the US or China is the third largest country by total area depends on two factors : ( 1 ) The validity of China 's claim on Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract . Both these territories are also claimed by India , so are not counted ; and ( 2 ) How US calculates its own surface area . Since the initial publishing of the World Factbook , the CIA has updated the total area of United States a number of times .
Until recently , in most critical writing the post-punk era was " often dismissed as an awkward period in which punk 's gleeful ructions petered out into the vacuity of the Eighties " . Contemporary scholars have argued to the contrary , asserting that the period produced significant innovations and music on its own . Simon Reynolds described the period as " a fair match for the sixties in terms of the sheer amount of great music created , the spirit of adventure and idealism that infused it , and the way that the music seemed inextricably connected to the political and social turbulence of its era " . Nicholas Lezard wrote that the music of the period " was avant-garde , open to any musical possibilities that suggested themselves , united only in the sense that it was very often cerebral , concocted by brainy young men and women interested as much in disturbing the audience , or making them think , as in making a pop song " .
Nanjing is the transportation hub in eastern China and the downstream Yangtze River area . Different means of transportation constitute a three-dimensional transport system that includes land , water and air . As in most other Chinese cities , public transportation is the dominant mode of travel of the majority of the citizens . As of October 2014 , Nanjing had five bridges and two tunnels over the Yangtze River , which are tying districts north of the river with the city centre on the south bank .
Hellenistic poets now sought patronage from kings , and wrote works in their honor . The scholars at the libraries in Alexandria and Pergamon focused on the collection , cataloging , and literary criticism of classical Athenian works and ancient Greek myths . The poet-critic Callimachus , a staunch elitist , wrote hymns equating Ptolemy II to Zeus and Apollo . He promoted short poetic forms such as the epigram , epyllion and the iambic and attacked epic as base and common ( " big book , big evil " was his doctrine ) . He also wrote a massive catalog of the holdings of the library of Alexandria , the famous Pinakes . Callimachus was extremely influential in his time and also for the development of Augustan poetry . Another poet , Apollonius of Rhodes , attempted to revive the epic for the Hellenistic world with his Argonautica . He had been a student of Callimachus and later became chief librarian ( prostates ) of the library of Alexandria , Apollonius and Callimachus spent much of their careers feuding with each other . Pastoral poetry also thrived during the Hellenistic era , Theocritus was a major poet who popularized the genre .
Southampton as a Port and city has had a long history of administrative independence of the surrounding County ; as far back as the reign of King John the town and its port were removed from the writ of the King 's Sheriff in Hampshire and the rights of custom and toll were granted by the King to the burgesses of Southampton over the port of Southampton and the Port of Portsmouth ; this tax farm was granted for an annual fee of £200 in the charter dated at Orival on 29 June 1199 . The definition of the port of Southampton was apparently broader than today and embraced all of the area between Lymington and Langstone . The corporation had resident representatives in Newport , Lymington and Portsmouth . By a charter of Henry VI , granted on 9 March 1446/7 ( 25+26 Hen . VI , m. 32 ) , the mayor , bailiffs and burgesses of the towns and ports of Southampton and Portsmouth became a County incorporate and separate from Hampshire .
The original Charter of 1837 set out the purpose of the Royal Institute to be : '… the general advancement of Civil Architecture , and for promoting and facilitating the acquirement of the knowledge of the various arts and sciences connected therewith… '
Pope Paul VI ( Latin : Paulus VI ; Italian : Paolo VI ) , born Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini ( Italian pronunciation : [ dʒioˈvani baˈtista enˈriko anˈtonjo marˈija monˈtini ] ; 26 September 1897 – 6 August 1978 ) , reigned as Pope from 21 June 1963 to his death in 1978 . Succeeding Pope John XXIII , he continued the Second Vatican Council which he closed in 1965 , implementing its numerous reforms , and fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants , which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements . Montini served in the Vatican 's Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954 . While in the Secretariat of State , Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential colleagues of Pope Pius XII , who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan , the largest Italian diocese . Montini automatically became the Secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference . John XXIII elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 1958 , and after the death of John XXIII , Montini was considered one of his most likely successors .
The Roman Republic ( Latin : Res publica Romana ; Classical Latin : [ ˈreːs ˈpuːb.lɪ.ka roːˈmaː.na ] ) was the period of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom , traditionally dated to 509 BC , and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire . It was during this period that Rome 's control expanded from the city 's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world . During the first two centuries of its existence , the Roman Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance , from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula . By the following century , it included North Africa , Spain , and what is now southern France . Two centuries after that , towards the end of the 1st century BC , it included the rest of modern France , Greece , and much of the eastern Mediterranean . By this time , internal tensions led to a series of civil wars , culminating with the assassination of Julius Caesar , which led to the transition from republic to empire . The exact date of transition can be a matter of interpretation . Historians have variously proposed Julius Caesar 's crossing of the Rubicon River in 49 BC , Caesar 's appointment as dictator for life in 44 BC , and the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . However , most use the same date as did the ancient Romans themselves , the Roman Senate 's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian and his adopting the title Augustus in 27 BC , as the defining event ending the Republic .
Paris and its close suburbs is home to numerous newspapers , magazines and publications including Le Monde , Le Figaro , Libération , Le Nouvel Observateur , Le Canard enchaîné , La Croix , Pariscope , Le Parisien ( in Saint-Ouen ) , Les Échos , Paris Match ( Neuilly-sur-Seine ) , Réseaux & Télécoms , Reuters France , and L'Officiel des Spectacles . France 's two most prestigious newspapers , Le Monde and Le Figaro , are the centrepieces of the Parisian publishing industry . Agence France-Presse is France 's oldest , and one of the world 's oldest , continually operating news agencies . AFP , as it is colloquially abbreviated , maintains its headquarters in Paris , as it has since 1835 . France 24 is a television news channel owned and operated by the French government , and is based in Paris . Another news agency is France Diplomatie , owned and operated by the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs , and pertains solely to diplomatic news and occurrences .
Executive power is vested , with exceptions and qualifications , in the President . By law ( Section 2 . ) the president becomes the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy , Militia of several states when called into service , has power to make treaties and appointments to office " with the Advice and Consent of the Senate , " receive Ambassadors and Public Ministers , and " take care that the laws be faithfully executed " ( Section 3 . ) By using these words , the Constitution does not require the president to personally enforce the law ; rather , officers subordinate to the president may perform such duties . The Constitution empowers the president to ensure the faithful execution of the laws made by Congress and approved by the President . Congress may itself terminate such appointments , by impeachment , and restrict the president . Bodies such as the War Claims Commission , the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Trade Commission—all quasi-judicial—often have direct Congressional oversight .
As an academic field , history of science began with the publication of William Whewell 's History of the Inductive Sciences ( first published in 1837 ) . A more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was launched by George Sarton 's publications , Introduction to the History of Science ( 1927 ) and the Isis journal ( founded in 1912 ) . Sarton exemplified the early 20th-century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas . He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress . The history of science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period , and most of the work was carried out by interested scientists and physicians rather than professional historians . With the work of I. Bernard Cohen at Harvard , the history of science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945 .
On 9 March 2016 , The Sun 's front page proclaimed that Queen Elizabeth II was backing " Brexit " , a common term for a British withdrawal from the European Union . It claimed that in 2011 at Windsor Castle , while having lunch with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg , the monarch criticised the union . Clegg denied that the Queen made such a statement , and a Buckingham Palace spokesperson confirmed that a complaint had been made to the Independent Press Standards Organisation over a breach of guidelines relating to accuracy .
Returning World War II veterans created a post-war economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens . New York emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world , with Wall Street leading America 's place as the world 's dominant economic power . The United Nations Headquarters was completed in 1952 , solidifying New York 's global geopolitical influence , and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York 's displacement of Paris as the center of the art world .
Process theology typically stresses God 's relational nature . Rather than seeing God as impassive or emotionless , process theologians view God as " the fellow sufferer who understands " , and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events . Hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers – so why would this be a praise-worthy quality in God ? Instead , as the being who is most affected by the world , God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world . However , process theology has been formulated in a wide variety of ways . C. Robert Mesle , for instance , advocates a " process naturalism " , i.e . a process theology without God .
Although Alexander Graham Bell is most often associated with the invention of the telephone , his interests were extremely varied . According to one of his biographers , Charlotte Gray , Bell 's work ranged " unfettered across the scientific landscape " and he often went to bed voraciously reading the Encyclopædia Britannica , scouring it for new areas of interest . The range of Bell 's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators . These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph , four for the photophone , one for the phonograph , five for aerial vehicles , four for " hydroairplanes " and two for selenium cells . Bell 's inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing , the audiometer to detect minor hearing problems , a device to locate icebergs , investigations on how to separate salt from seawater , and work on finding alternative fuels .
From September 1823 to 1826 Chopin attended the Warsaw Lyceum , where he received organ lessons from the Czech musician Wilhelm Würfel during his first year . In the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course under the Silesian composer Józef Elsner at the Warsaw Conservatory , studying music theory , figured bass and composition . [ n 3 ] Throughout this period he continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in Warsaw . He was engaged by the inventors of a mechanical organ , the " eolomelodicon " , and on this instrument in May 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a concerto by Moscheles . The success of this concert led to an invitation to give a similar recital on the instrument before Tsar Alexander I , who was visiting Warsaw ; the Tsar presented him with a diamond ring . At a subsequent eolomelodicon concert on 10 June 1825 , Chopin performed his Rondo Op . 1 . This was the first of his works to be commercially published and earned him his first mention in the foreign press , when the Leipzig Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung praised his " wealth of musical ideas " .
When paying a state visit to Britain , foreign heads of state are usually entertained by the Queen at Buckingham Palace . They are allocated a large suite of rooms known as the Belgian Suite , situated at the foot of the Minister 's Staircase , on the ground floor of the north-facing Garden Wing . The rooms of the suite are linked by narrow corridors , one of them is given extra height and perspective by saucer domes designed by Nash in the style of Soane . A second corridor in the suite has Gothic influenced cross over vaulting . The Belgian Rooms themselves were decorated in their present style and named after Prince Albert 's uncle Léopold I , first King of the Belgians . In 1936 , the suite briefly became the private apartments of the palace when they were occupied by King Edward VIII .
Somali society is traditionally ethnically endogamous . So to extend ties of alliance , marriage is often to another ethnic Somali from a different clan . Thus , for example , a recent study observed that in 89 marriages contracted by men of the Dhulbahante clan , 55 ( 62 % ) were with women of Dhulbahante sub-clans other than those of their husbands ; 30 ( 33.7 % ) were with women of surrounding clans of other clan families ( Isaaq , 28 ; Hawiye , 3 ) ; and 3 ( 4.3 % ) were with women of other clans of the Darod clan family ( Majerteen 2 , Ogaden 1 ) .
In May and June 1939 , the King and Queen toured Canada and the United States . From Ottawa , the royal couple were accompanied throughout by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King , to present themselves in North America as King and Queen of Canada . George was the first reigning monarch of Canada to visit North America , although he had been to Canada previously as Prince Albert and as Duke of York . Both Governor General of Canada Lord Tweedsmuir and Mackenzie King hoped that the King 's presence in Canada would demonstrate the principles of the Statute of Westminster 1931 , which gave full sovereignty to the British Dominions . On 19 May , George VI personally accepted and approved the Letter of Credence of the new U.S . Ambassador to Canada , Daniel Calhoun Roper ; gave Royal Assent to nine parliamentary bills ; and ratified two international treaties with the Great Seal of Canada . The official royal tour historian , Gustave Lanctot , wrote " the Statute of Westminster had assumed full reality " and George gave a speech emphasising " the free and equal association of the nations of the Commonwealth " .
In 1867 , Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh and second son of Queen Victoria , visited the islands . The main settlement , Edinburgh of the Seven Seas , was named in honour of his visit . Lewis Carroll 's youngest brother , the Reverend Edwin Heron Dodgson , served as an Anglican missionary and schoolteacher in Tristan da Cunha in the 1880s .
Iranian scientists outside Iran have also made some major contributions to science . In 1960 , Ali Javan co-invented the first gas laser , and fuzzy set theory was introduced by Lotfi Zadeh . Iranian cardiologist , Tofy Mussivand invented and developed the first artificial cardiac pump , the precursor of the artificial heart . Furthering research and treatment of diabetes , HbA1c was discovered by Samuel Rahbar . Iranian physics is especially strong in string theory , with many papers being published in Iran . Iranian-American string theorist Kamran Vafa proposed the Vafa-Witten theorem together with Edward Witten . In August 2014 , Maryam Mirzakhani became the first-ever woman , as well as the first-ever Iranian , to receive the Fields Medal , the highest prize in mathematics .
Reform of the liturgy had been a part of the liturgical movements in the 20th century mainly in France , and Germany which were officially recognized by Pius XII in his encyclical Mediator Dei . During the pontificate of Pius XII , the Vatican eased regulations on the use of Latin in Roman Catholic liturgies , permitting some use of vernacular languages during baptisms , funerals and other events . In 1951 and 1955 , the Easter liturgies underwent revision , most notably including the reintroduction of the Easter Triduum . The Second Vatican Council made no changes to the Roman Missal , but in the document Sacrosanctum Concilium mandated that a general revision of it take place . After the Vatican Council , in April 1969 , Paul VI approved the " new Order of Mass " promulgated in 1970 , as stated in the Acta Apostolica Sedis to " end experimentation " with the Mass and which included the introduction of three new Eucharistic Prayers to what was up to then a single Roman Canon .
Another possible cause of diarrhea is irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , which usually presents with abdominal discomfort relieved by defecation and unusual stool ( diarrhea or constipation ) for at least 3 days a week over the previous 3 months . Symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS can be managed through a combination of dietary changes , soluble fiber supplements , and/or medications such as loperamide or codeine . About 30 % of patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS have bile acid malabsorption diagnosed with an abnormal SeHCAT test .
Severe weather occurs regularly in North Carolina . On the average , a hurricane hits the state once a decade . Destructive hurricanes that have struck the state include Hurricane Fran , Hurricane Floyd , and Hurricane Hazel , the strongest storm to make landfall in the state , as a Category 4 in 1954 . Hurricane Isabel stands out as the most damaging of the 21st century . Tropical storms arrive every 3 or 4 years . In addition , many hurricanes and tropical storms graze the state . In some years , several hurricanes or tropical storms can directly strike the state or brush across the coastal areas . Only Florida and Louisiana are hit by hurricanes more often . Although many people believe that hurricanes menace only coastal areas , the rare hurricane which moves inland quickly enough can cause severe damage ; for example , in 1989 , Hurricane Hugo caused heavy damage in Charlotte and even as far inland as the Blue Ridge Mountains in the northwestern part of the state . On the average , North Carolina has 50 days of thunderstorm activity per year , with some storms becoming severe enough to produce hail , flash floods , and damaging winds .
In a WRIM , the rotor winding is made of many turns of insulated wire and is connected to slip rings on the motor shaft . An external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit . Resistors allow control of the motor speed , although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance . A converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power that would otherwise be wasted back into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator .
Until recently , in most critical writing the post-punk era was " often dismissed as an awkward period in which punk 's gleeful ructions petered out into the vacuity of the Eighties " . Contemporary scholars have argued to the contrary , asserting that the period produced significant innovations and music on its own . Simon Reynolds described the period as " a fair match for the sixties in terms of the sheer amount of great music created , the spirit of adventure and idealism that infused it , and the way that the music seemed inextricably connected to the political and social turbulence of its era " . Nicholas Lezard wrote that the music of the period " was avant-garde , open to any musical possibilities that suggested themselves , united only in the sense that it was very often cerebral , concocted by brainy young men and women interested as much in disturbing the audience , or making them think , as in making a pop song " .
The English held the city for 16 months and defeated several attempts to expel them . English soldiers advanced as far as Requena on the road to Madrid . After the victory of the Bourbons at the Battle of Almansa on 25 April 1707 , the English army evacuated Valencia and Philip V ordered the repeal of the privileges of Valencia as punishment for the kingdom 's support of Charles of Austria . By the Nueva Planta decrees ( Decretos de Nueva Planta ) the ancient Charters of Valencia were abolished and the city was governed by the Castilian Charter . The Bourbon forces burned important cities like Xativa , where pictures of the Spanish Bourbons in public places are hung upside down as a protest to this day . The capital of the Kingdom of Valencia was moved to Orihuela , an outrage to the citizens of Valencia . Philip ordered the Cortes to meet with the Viceroy of Valencia , Cardinal Luis de Belluga , who opposed the change of capital because of the proximity of Orihuela , a religious , cultural and now political centre , to Murcia ( capital of another viceroyalty and his diocese ) . Because of his hatred of the city of Orihuela , which had bombarded and looted Valencia during the War of Succession , the cardinal resigned the viceroyalty in protest against the actions of Philip , who finally relented and returned the capital to Valencia .
The eligible age-range for contestants is currently fifteen to twenty-eight years old . The initial age limit was sixteen to twenty-four in the first three seasons , but the upper limit was raised to twenty-eight in season four , and the lower limit was reduced to fifteen in season ten . The contestants must be legal U.S. residents , can not have advanced to particular stages of the competition in previous seasons ( varies depending on the season , currently by the semi-final stage until season thirteen ) , and must not hold any current recording or talent representation contract by the semi-final stage ( in previous years by the audition stage ) .
On October 25 , 1989 , the Supreme Soviet voted to eliminate special seats for the Communist Party and other official organizations in national and local elections , responding to sharp popular criticism that such reserved slots were undemocratic . After vigorous debate , the 542-member Supreme Soviet passed the measure 254-85 ( with 36 abstentions ) . The decision required a constitutional amendment , ratified by the full congress , which met December 12–25 . It also passed measures that would allow direct elections for presidents of each of the 15 constituent republics . Gorbachev strongly opposed such a move during debate but was defeated .
Jerry Kurz also stepped down as commissioner of the AFL as he was promoted to be the AFL 's first president . Former Foxwoods CEO Scott Butera was hired as his successor as commissioner .
What little there was , started with Charles de Wailly 's crypt in the church of St Leu-St Gilles ( 1773–80 ) , and Claude Nicolas Ledoux 's Barriere des Bonshommes ( 1785–89 ) . First-hand evidence of Greek architecture was of very little importance to the French , due to the influence of Marc-Antoine Laugier 's doctrines that sought to discern the principles of the Greeks instead of their mere practices . It would take until Laboustre 's Neo-Grec of the second Empire for the Greek revival to flower briefly in France .
According to a study done by Helmut Fend ( who had always been a fierce proponent of comprehensive schools ) revealed that comprehensive schools do not help working class students . He compared alumni of the tripartite system to alumni of comprehensive schools . While working class alumni of comprehensive schools were awarded better school diplomas at age 35 , they held similar occupational positions as working class alumni of the tripartite system and were as unlikely to graduate from college .
Guam lies between 13.2°N and 13.7°N and between 144.6°E and 145.0°E , and has an area of 212 square miles ( 549 km2 ) , making it the 32nd largest island of the United States . It is the southernmost and largest island in the Mariana island chain and is also the largest island in Micronesia . This island chain was created by the colliding Pacific and Philippine Sea tectonic plates . Guam is the closest land mass to the Mariana Trench , a deep subduction zone , that lies beside the island chain to the east . Challenger Deep , the deepest surveyed point in the Oceans , is southwest of Guam at 35,797 feet ( 10,911 meters ) deep . The highest point in Guam is Mount Lamlam at an elevation of 1,334 feet ( 407 meters ) .
Worldwide prosperity changed dramatically with the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 . The Wall Street Crash of 1929 served to punctuate the end of the previous era , as The Great Depression set in . The Great Depression was a worldwide economic downturn starting in most places in 1929 and ending at different times in the 1930s or early 1940s for different countries . It was the largest and most important economic depression in the 20th century , and is used in the 21st century as an example of how far the world 's economy can fall .
Almost all Protestant denominations are represented in Paris , with 74 evangelical churches from various denominations , including 21 parishes of the United Protestant Church of France and two parishes of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints . There are several important churches for the English-speaking community : the American Church in Paris , founded in 1814 , was the first American church outside the United States ; the current church was finished in 1931 . The Saint George 's Anglican Church in the 16th arrondissement is the principal Anglican church in the city .
On 29 November 1947 , the United Nations General Assembly recommended the adoption and implementation of the Partition Plan for Mandatory Palestine . This UN plan specified borders for new Arab and Jewish states and also specified an area of Jerusalem and its environs which was to be administered by the UN under an international regime . The end of the British Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948 . That day , David Ben-Gurion , the executive head of the Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine , declared " the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel , to be known as the State of Israel , " which would start to function from the termination of the mandate . The borders of the new state were not specified in the declaration . Neighboring Arab armies invaded the former Palestinian mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces . Israel has since fought several wars with neighboring Arab states , in the course of which it has occupied the West Bank , Sinai Peninsula ( 1956–57 , 1967–82 ) , part of Southern Lebanon ( 1982–2000 ) , Gaza Strip ( 1967–2005 ; still considered occupied after 2005 disengagement ) and the Golan Heights . It extended its laws to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem , but not the West Bank . Efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have not resulted in peace . However , peace treaties between Israel and both Egypt and Jordan have successfully been signed . Israel 's occupation of Gaza , the West Bank and East Jerusalem is the world 's longest military occupation in modern times . [ note 2 ]
Hans Bielenstein writes that as far back as the Han dynasty ( 202 BCE–220 CE ) , the Han Chinese government " maintained the fiction " that the foreign officials administering the various " Dependent States " and oasis city-states of the Western Regions ( composed of the Tarim Basin and oasis of Turpan ) were true Han representatives due to the Han government 's conferral of Chinese seals and seal cords to them .
MP3 was designed by the Moving Picture Experts Group ( MPEG ) as part of its MPEG-1 standard and later extended in the MPEG-2 standard . The first subgroup for audio was formed by several teams of engineers at Fraunhofer IIS , University of Hannover , AT & T-Bell Labs , Thomson-Brandt , CCETT , and others . MPEG-1 Audio ( MPEG-1 Part 3 ) , which included MPEG-1 Audio Layer I , II and III was approved as a committee draft of ISO/IEC standard in 1991 , finalised in 1992 and published in 1993 ( ISO/IEC 11172-3:1993 ) . Backwards compatible MPEG-2 Audio ( MPEG-2 Part 3 ) with additional bit rates and sample rates was published in 1995 ( ISO/IEC 13818-3:1995 ) .
A move to " permanent daylight saving time " ( staying on summer hours all year with no time shifts ) is sometimes advocated , and has in fact been implemented in some jurisdictions such as Argentina , Chile , Iceland , Singapore , Uzbekistan and Belarus . Advocates cite the same advantages as normal DST without the problems associated with the twice yearly time shifts . However , many remain unconvinced of the benefits , citing the same problems and the relatively late sunrises , particularly in winter , that year-round DST entails . Russia switched to permanent DST from 2011 to 2014 , but the move proved unpopular because of the late sunrises in winter , so the country switched permanently back to " standard " or " winter " time in 2014 .
In the following two decades after Sianis ' ill will , the Cubs played mostly forgettable baseball , finishing among the worst teams in the National League on an almost annual basis . Longtime infielder/manager Phil Cavarretta , who had been a key player during the '45 season , was fired during spring training in 1954 after admitting the team was unlikely to finish above fifth place . Although shortstop Ernie Banks would become one of the star players in the league during the next decade , finding help for him proved a difficult task , as quality players such as Hank Sauer were few and far between . This , combined with poor ownership decisions such as the College of Coaches , and the ill-fated trade of future Hall of Famer Lou Brock to the Cardinals for pitcher Ernie Broglio ( who won only 7 games over the next three seasons ) , hampered on-field performance .
Although professional wrestling in Mexico ( lucha libre ) also has stories and characters , they are less emphasized . Wrestlers in Mexico are traditionally more agile and perform more aerial maneuvers than professional wrestlers in the U.S. who , more often , rely on power moves and strikes to subdue their opponents . The difference in styles is due to the independent evolution of the sport in Mexico beginning in the 1930s and the fact that wrestlers in the cruiserweight division ( peso semicompleto ) are often the most popular wrestlers in Mexican lucha libre . Wrestlers often execute high flying moves characteristic of lucha libre by utilizing the wrestling ring 's ropes to catapult themselves towards their opponents , using intricate combinations in rapid-fire succession , and applying complex submission holds . Lucha libre is also known for its tag team wrestling matches , in which the teams are often made up of three members , instead of two as is common in the U.S .
In 1634 , the Mughal emperor extended his hospitality to the English traders to the region of Bengal , and in 1717 completely waived customs duties for the trade . The company 's mainstay businesses were by then cotton , silk , indigo dye , saltpetre , and tea . The Dutch were aggressive competitors and had meanwhile expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the Malaccan straits by ousting the Portuguese in 1640–41 . With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region , the EIC and Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) entered a period of intense competition , resulting in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th and 18th centuries .
Kerry was born in Aurora , Colorado and attended boarding school in Massachusetts and New Hampshire . He graduated from Yale University class of 1966 with a political science major . Kerry enlisted in the Naval Reserve in 1966 , and during 1968–1969 served an abbreviated four-month tour of duty in South Vietnam as officer-in-charge ( OIC ) of a Swift Boat . For that service , he was awarded combat medals that include the Silver Star Medal , Bronze Star Medal , and three Purple Heart Medals . Securing an early return to the United States , Kerry joined the Vietnam Veterans Against the War organization in which he served as a nationally recognized spokesman and as an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War . He appeared in the Fulbright Hearings before the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs where he deemed United States war policy in Vietnam to be the cause of war crimes .
To promote culture Utrecht city organizes cultural Sundays . During a thematic Sunday several organisations create a program , which is open to everyone without , or with a very much reduced , admission fee . There are also initiatives for amateur artists . The city subsidises an organisation for amateur education in arts aimed at all inhabitants ( Utrechts Centrum voor de Kunsten ) , as does the university for its staff and students . Additionally there are also several private initiatives . The city council provides coupons for discounts to inhabitants who receive welfare to be used with many of the initiatives .
The Kushan Empire , a collection of Yuezhi tribes , took control of the region in the first century CE and ruled until the 4th century CE during which time Buddhism , Nestorian Christianity , Zoroastrianism , and Manichaeism were all practiced in the region . Later the Hephthalite Empire , a collection of nomadic tribes , moved into the region and Arabs brought Islam in the early eighth century . Central Asia continued in its role as a commercial crossroads , linking China , the steppes to the north , and the Islamic heartland .
Zinc is a bluish-white , lustrous , diamagnetic metal , though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish . It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure , with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing , in which each atom has six nearest neighbors ( at 265.9 pm ) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm . The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150 °C . Above 210 °C , the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating . Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity . For a metal , zinc has relatively low melting ( 419.5 °C ) and boiling points ( 907 °C ) . Its melting point is the lowest of all the transition metals aside from mercury and cadmium .
In September 1828 Chopin , while still a student , visited Berlin with a family friend , zoologist Feliks Jarocki , enjoying operas directed by Gaspare Spontini and attending concerts by Carl Friedrich Zelter , Felix Mendelssohn and other celebrities . On an 1829 return trip to Berlin , he was a guest of Prince Antoni Radziwiłł , governor of the Grand Duchy of Posen—himself an accomplished composer and aspiring cellist . For the prince and his pianist daughter Wanda , he composed his Introduction and Polonaise brillante in C major for cello and piano , Op . 3 .
According to his autobiography , Avicenna had memorised the entire Quran by the age of 10 . He learned Indian arithmetic from an Indian greengrocer , ءMahmoud Massahi and he began to learn more from a wandering scholar who gained a livelihood by curing the sick and teaching the young . He also studied Fiqh ( Islamic jurisprudence ) under the Sunni Hanafi scholar Ismail al-Zahid . Avicenna was taught some extent of philosophy books such as Introduction ( Isagoge ) 's Porphyry ( philosopher ) , Euclid 's Elements , Ptolemy 's Almagest by an unpopular philosopher , Abu Abdullah Nateli , who claimed philosophizing .
The transistor is the fundamental building block of modern electronic devices , and is ubiquitous in modern electronic systems . First conceived by Julius Lilienfeld in 1926 and practically implemented in 1947 by American physicists John Bardeen , Walter Brattain , and William Shockley , the transistor revolutionized the field of electronics , and paved the way for smaller and cheaper radios , calculators , and computers , among other things . The transistor is on the list of IEEE milestones in electronics , and Bardeen , Brattain , and Shockley shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for their achievement .
Ancient tables provided the sun 's mean longitude . Christopher Clavius , the architect of the Gregorian calendar , noted that the tables agreed neither on the time when the sun passed through the vernal equinox nor on the length of the mean tropical year . Tycho Brahe also noticed discrepancies . The Gregorian leap year rule ( 97 leap years in 400 years ) was put forward by Petrus Pitatus of Verona in 1560 . He noted that it is consistent with the tropical year of the Alfonsine tables and with the mean tropical year of Copernicus ( De revolutionibus ) and Reinhold ( Prutenic tables ) . The three mean tropical years in Babylonian sexagesimals as the excess over 365 days ( the way they would have been extracted from the tables of mean longitude ) were 14,33,9,57 ( Alphonsine ) , 14,33,11,12 ( Copernicus ) and 14,33,9,24 ( Reinhold ) . All values are the same to two places ( 14:33 ) and this is also the mean length of the Gregorian year . Thus Pitatus ' solution would have commended itself to the astronomers .
Conrad Gessner was the first naturalist to ascend the mountains in the 16th century , to study them , writing that in the mountains he found the " theatre of the Lord " . By the 19th century more naturalists began to arrive to explore , study and conquer the high peaks ; they were followed by artists , writers and painters . Two men who first explored the regions of ice and snow were Horace-Bénédict de Saussure ( 1740–1799 ) in the Pennine Alps , and the Benedictine monk of Disentis Placidus a Spescha ( 1752–1833 ) . Born in Geneva , Saussure was enamored with the mountains from an early age ; he left a law career to become a naturalist and spent many years trekking through the Bernese Oberland , the Savoy , the Piedmont and Valais , studying the glaciers and the geology , as he became an early proponent of the theory of rock upheaval . Saussure , in 1787 , was a member of the third ascent of Mont Blanc—today the summits of all the peaks have been climbed .
The layout of the inner suburbs on a largely one-mile grid pattern , cut through by wide radial boulevards , and string of gardens surrounding the central city was largely established in the 1850s and 1860s . These areas were rapidly filled from the mid 1850s by the ubiquitous terrace house , as well as detached houses and some grand mansions in large grounds , while some of the major roads developed as shopping streets . Melbourne quickly became a major finance centre , home to several banks , the Royal Mint , and Australia 's first stock exchange in 1861 . In 1855 the Melbourne Cricket Club secured possession of its now famous ground , the MCG . Members of the Melbourne Football Club codified Australian football in 1859 , and Yarra rowing clubs and " regattas " became popular about the same time . In 1861 the Melbourne Cup was first run . In 1864 Melbourne acquired its first public monument—the Burke and Wills statue .
Nintendo was not as restrictive as Sega , which did not permit third-party publishing until Mediagenic in late summer 1988 . Nintendo 's intention , however , was to reserve a large part of NES game revenue for itself . Nintendo required that they be the sole manufacturer of all cartridges , and that the publisher had to pay in full before the cartridges for that game be produced . Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo , so publishers assumed all the risk . As a result , some publishers lost more money due to distress sales of remaining inventory at the end of the NES era than they ever earned in profits from sales of the games . Because Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges , it was able to enforce strict rules on its third-party developers , which were required to sign a contract by Nintendo that would obligate these parties to develop exclusively for the system , order at least 10,000 cartridges , and only make five games per year . A 1988 shortage of DRAM and ROM chips also reportedly caused Nintendo to only permit 25 % of publishers ' requests for cartridges . This was an average figure , with some publishers receiving much higher amounts and others almost none . GameSpy noted that Nintendo 's " iron-clad terms " made the company many enemies during the 1980s . Some developers tried to circumvent the five game limit by creating additional company brands like Konami 's Ultra Games label ; others tried circumventing the 10NES chip .
London is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom . Many government departments are based close to the Palace of Westminster , particularly along Whitehall , including the Prime Minister 's residence at 10 Downing Street . The British Parliament is often referred to as the " Mother of Parliaments " ( although this sobriquet was first applied to England itself by John Bright ) because it has been the model for most other parliamentary systems . There are 73 Members of Parliament ( MPs ) from London , who correspond to local parliamentary constituencies in the national Parliament . As of May 2015 , 45 are from the Labour Party , 27 are Conservatives , and one is a Liberal Democrat .
The geography of Southampton is influenced by the sea and rivers . The city lies at the northern tip of the Southampton Water , a deep water estuary , which is a ria formed at the end of the last Ice Age . Here , the rivers Test and Itchen converge . The Test—which has salt marsh that makes it ideal for salmon fishing—runs along the western edge of the city , while the Itchen splits Southampton in two—east and west . The city centre is located between the two rivers .
Yale University , one of the oldest universities in the United States , is a cultural referent as an institution that produces some of the most elite members of society and its grounds , alumni , and students have been prominently portrayed in fiction and U.S. popular culture . For example , Owen Johnson 's novel , Stover at Yale , follows the college career of Dink Stover and Frank Merriwell , the model for all later juvenile sports fiction , plays football , baseball , crew , and track at Yale while solving mysteries and righting wrongs . Yale University also is featured in F. Scott Fitzgerald 's novel " The Great Gatsby " . The narrator , Nick Carraway , wrote a series of editorials for the Yale News , and Tom Buchanan was " one of the most powerful ends that ever played football " for Yale .
Artists such as Gary Numan , the Human League , Soft Cell , John Foxx and Visage helped pioneer a new synthpop style that drew more heavily from electronic and synthesizer music and benefited from the rise of MTV . Post-punk artists such as Scritti Politti 's Green Gartside and Josef K 's Paul Haig , previously engaged in avant-garde practices , turned away from these approaches and pursued mainstream styles and commercial success . These new developments , in which post-punk artists attempted to bring subversive ideas into the pop mainstream , began to be categorized under the marketing term new pop .
In Japan , 14 August is considered to be the day that the Pacific War ended . However , as Imperial Japan actually surrendered on 15 August , this day became known in the English-speaking countries as " V-J Day " ( Victory in Japan ) . The formal Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed on 2 September 1945 , on the battleship USS Missouri , in Tokyo Bay . The surrender was accepted by General Douglas MacArthur as Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers , with representatives of several Allied nations , from a Japanese delegation led by Mamoru Shigemitsu and Yoshijiro Umezu .
For example , the full name of Oda Nobunaga would be " Oda Kazusanosuke Saburo Nobunaga " ( 織田上総介三郎信長 ) , in which " Oda " is a clan or family name , " Kazusanosuke " is a title of vice-governor of Kazusa province , " Saburo " is a formal nickname ( yobina ) , and " Nobunaga " is an adult name ( nanori ) given at genpuku , the coming of age ceremony . A man was addressed by his family name and his title , or by his yobina if he did not have a title . However , the nanori was a private name that could be used by only a very few , including the Emperor .
WHO recommends a child with diarrhea continue to be fed . Continued feeding speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function . In contrast , children whose food is restricted have diarrhea of longer duration and recover intestinal function more slowly . A child should also continue to be breastfed . The WHO states " Food should never be withheld and the child 's usual foods should not be diluted . Breastfeeding should always be continued . " And in the specific example of cholera , CDC also makes the same recommendation . In young children who are not breast-fed and live in the developed world , a lactose-free diet may be useful to speed recovery .
Victoria 's father was Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn , the fourth son of the reigning King of the United Kingdom , George III . Until 1817 , Edward 's niece , Princess Charlotte of Wales , was the only legitimate grandchild of George III . Her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children . In 1818 he married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld , a widowed German princess with two children—Carl ( 1804–1856 ) and Feodora ( 1807–1872 ) —by her first marriage to the Prince of Leiningen . Her brother Leopold was Princess Charlotte 's widower . The Duke and Duchess of Kent 's only child , Victoria , was born at 4.15 a.m. on 24 May 1819 at Kensington Palace in London .
By 6000 BCE predynastic Egyptians in the southwestern corner of Egypt were herding cattle and constructing large buildings . Subsistence in organized and permanent settlements in predynastic Egypt by the middle of the 6th millennium BCE centered predominantly on cereal and animal agriculture : cattle , goats , pigs and sheep . Metal objects replaced prior ones of stone . Tanning of animal skins , pottery and weaving were commonplace in this era also . There are indications of seasonal or only temporary occupation of the Al Fayyum in the 6th millennium BCE , with food activities centering on fishing , hunting and food-gathering . Stone arrowheads , knives and scrapers from the era are commonly found . Burial items included pottery , jewelry , farming and hunting equipment , and assorted foods including dried meat and fruit . Burial in desert environments appears to enhance Egyptian preservation rites , and dead were buried facing due west .
The structure of the Swiss militia system stipulates that the soldiers keep their Army issued equipment , including all personal weapons , at home . Some organizations and political parties find this practice controversial but mainstream Swiss opinion is in favour of the system . Compulsory military service concerns all male Swiss citizens ; women can serve voluntarily . Men usually receive military conscription orders for training at the age of 18 . About two thirds of the young Swiss are found suited for service ; for those found unsuited , various forms of alternative service exist . Annually , approximately 20,000 persons are trained in recruit centres for a duration from 18 to 21 weeks . The reform " Army XXI " was adopted by popular vote in 2003 , it replaced the previous model " Army 95 " , reducing the effectives from 400,000 to about 200,000 . Of those , 120,000 are active in periodic Army training and 80,000 are non-training reserves .
The abbey became the coronation site of Norman kings . None were buried there until Henry III , intensely devoted to the cult of the Confessor , rebuilt the abbey in Anglo-French Gothic style as a shrine to venerate King Edward the Confessor and as a suitably regal setting for Henry 's own tomb , under the highest Gothic nave in England . The Confessor 's shrine subsequently played a great part in his canonisation . The work continued between 1245 and 1517 and was largely finished by the architect Henry Yevele in the reign of Richard II . Henry III also commissioned unique Cosmati pavement in front of the High Altar ( the pavement has recently undergone a major cleaning and conservation programme and was re-dedicated by the Dean at a service on 21 May 2010 ) .
The club also owned and operated a professional basketball team , by the name of Everton Tigers , who compete in the elite British Basketball League . The team was launched in the summer of 2007 as part of the clubs ' Community programme , and play their home games at the Greenbank Sports Academy . The team was an amalgam of the Toxteth Tigers community youth programme which started in 1968 . The team quickly became one of the most successful in the league winning the BBL Cup in 2009 and the play-offs in 2010 . However Everton withdrew funding before the 2010–11 season and the team was re launched as the Mersey Tigers .
Insects have segmented bodies supported by exoskeletons , the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin . The segments of the body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units , or tagmata : a head , a thorax and an abdomen . The head supports a pair of sensory antennae , a pair of compound eyes , and , if present , one to three simple eyes ( or ocelli ) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts . The thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax , mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and , none , two or four wings . The abdomen consists of eleven segments , though in a few species of insects , these segments may be fused together or reduced in size . The abdomen also contains most of the digestive , respiratory , excretory and reproductive internal structures . :22–48 Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur , especially wings , legs , antenna and mouthparts .
As Charles Town grew , so did the community 's cultural and social opportunities , especially for the elite merchants and planters . The first theatre building in America was built in 1736 on the site of today 's Dock Street Theatre . Benevolent societies were formed by different ethnic groups , from French Huguenots to free people of color to Germans to Jews . The Charles Towne Library Society was established in 1748 by well-born young men who wanted to share the financial cost to keep up with the scientific and philosophical issues of the day . This group also helped establish the College of Charles Towne in 1770 , the oldest college in South Carolina . Until its transition to state ownership in 1970 , this was the oldest municipally supported college in the United States .
The Soviet Union duplicated its dual-launch feat with Vostok 5 and Vostok 6 ( June 16 , 1963 ) . This time they launched the first woman ( also the first civilian ) , Valentina Tereshkova , into space on Vostok 6 . Launching a woman was reportedly Korolev 's idea , and it was accomplished purely for propaganda value . Tereshkova was one of a small corps of female cosmonauts who were amateur parachutists , but Tereshkova was the only one to fly . The USSR did n't again open its cosmonaut corps to women until 1980 , two years after the United States opened its astronaut corps to women .
Boston has teams in the four major North American professional sports leagues plus Major League Soccer , and has won 36 championships in these leagues , As of 2014 [ update ] . It is one of six cities ( along with Chicago , Detroit , Los Angeles , New York and Philadelphia ) to have won championships in all four major sports . It has been suggested that Boston is the new " TitleTown , USA " , as the city 's professional sports teams have won nine championships since 2001 : Patriots ( 2001 , 2003 , 2004 , and 2014 ) , Red Sox ( 2004 , 2007 , and 2013 ) , Celtics ( 2008 ) , and Bruins ( 2011 ) . This love of sports has made Boston the United States Olympic Committee 's choice to bid to hold the 2024 Summer Olympic Games , but the city cited financial concerns when it withdrew its bid on July 27 , 2015 .
This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions . The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , World Bank , European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) , and other international financial institutions ( IFIs ) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans . Loans to Armenia since 1993 exceed $ 1.1 billion . These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit and stabilizing the currency ; developing private businesses ; energy ; agriculture ; food processing ; transportation ; the health and education sectors ; and ongoing rehabilitation in the earthquake zone . The government joined the World Trade Organization on 5 February 2003 . But one of the main sources of foreign direct investments remains the Armenian diaspora , which finances major parts of the reconstruction of infrastructure and other public projects . Being a growing democratic state , Armenia also hopes to get more financial aid from the Western World .
Some powerful Polish nobles were referred to as " magnates " ( Polish singular : " magnat " , plural : " magnaci " ) and " możny " ( " magnate " , " oligarch " ; plural : " możni " ) ; see Magnates of Poland and Lithuania .
The Gurjar Pratihar Empire acted as a barrier for Arab invaders from the 8th to the 11th century . The chief accomplishment of the Gurjara Pratihara empire lies in its successful resistance to foreign invasions from the west , starting in the days of Junaid . Historian R. C. Majumdar says that this was openly acknowledged by the Arab writers . He further notes that historians of India have wondered at the slow progress of Muslim invaders in India , as compared with their rapid advance in other parts of the world . Now there seems little doubt that it was the power of the Gurjara Pratihara army that effectively barred the progress of the Arabs beyond the confines of Sindh , their first conquest for nearly 300 years .
Madonna 's music has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny . Robert M. Grant , author of Contemporary Strategy Analysis ( 2005 ) , commented that what has brought Madonna success is " certainly not outstanding natural talent . As a vocalist , musician , dancer , songwriter , or actress , Madonna 's talents seem modest . " He asserts Madonna 's success is in relying on the talents of others , and that her personal relationships have served as cornerstones to the numerous reinventions in the longevity of her career . Madonna 's approach was far from the music industry wisdom of " Find a winning formula and stick to it . " Her musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim . Grant concluded that " having established herself as the queen of popular music , Madonna did not stop there , but continued re-inventing . " Musicologist Susan McClary wrote that " Madonna 's art itself repeatedly deconstructs the traditional notion of the unified subject with finite ego boundaries . Her pieces explore various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability , that remain fluid , that resist definition . "
For " closed systems " with no external source or sink of energy , the first law of thermodynamics states that a system 's energy is constant unless energy is transferred in or out by mechanical work or heat , and that no energy is lost in transfer . This means that it is impossible to create or destroy energy . While heat can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas , for cyclic processes of practical interest in heat engines the second law of thermodynamics states that the system doing work always loses some energy as waste heat . This creates a limit to the amount of heat energy that can do work in a cyclic process , a limit called the available energy . Mechanical and other forms of energy can be transformed in the other direction into thermal energy without such limitations . The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up all forms of energy in the system .
Geothermal power capacity grew from around 1 GW in 1975 to almost 10 GW in 2008 . The United States is the world leader in terms of installed capacity , representing 3.1 GW . Other countries with significant installed capacity include the Philippines ( 1.9 GW ) , Indonesia ( 1.2 GW ) , Mexico ( 1.0 GW ) , Italy ( 0.8 GW ) , Iceland ( 0.6 GW ) , Japan ( 0.5 GW ) , and New Zealand ( 0.5 GW ) . In some countries , geothermal power accounts for a significant share of the total electricity supply , such as in the Philippines , where geothermal represented 17 percent of the total power mix at the end of 2008 .
The most important archaeological discoveries in Sumer are a large number of tablets written in cuneiform . Sumerian writing , while proven to be not the oldest example of writing on earth , is considered to be a great milestone in the development of man 's ability to not only create historical records but also in creating pieces of literature both in the form of poetic epics and stories as well as prayers and laws . Although pictures — that is , hieroglyphs — were first used , cuneiform and then Ideograms ( where symbols were made to represent ideas ) soon followed . Triangular or wedge-shaped reeds were used to write on moist clay . A large body of hundreds of thousands of texts in the Sumerian language have survived , such as personal or business letters , receipts , lexical lists , laws , hymns , prayers , stories , daily records , and even libraries full of clay tablets . Monumental inscriptions and texts on different objects like statues or bricks are also very common . Many texts survive in multiple copies because they were repeatedly transcribed by scribes-in-training . Sumerian continued to be the language of religion and law in Mesopotamia long after Semitic speakers had become dominant .
As of the 2000 United States census , there were 276,093 persons ( July 2008 estimate was 380,173 ) and 61,371 families residing in Raleigh . The population density was 2,409.2 people per square mile ( 930.2/km² ) . There were 120,699 housing units at an average density of 1,053.2 per square mile ( 406.7/km² ) . The racial composition of the city was : 63.31 % White , 27.80 % Black or African American , 7.01 % Hispanic or Latino American , 3.38 % Asian American , 0.36 % Native American , 0.04 % Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander , 3.24 % some other race , and 1.88 % two or more races .
From the early 12th century , French builders developed the Gothic style , marked by the use of rib vaults , pointed arches , flying buttresses , and large stained glass windows . It was used mainly in churches and cathedrals , and continued in use until the 16th century in much of Europe . Classic examples of Gothic architecture include Chartres Cathedral and Reims Cathedral in France as well as Salisbury Cathedral in England . Stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches , which continued to use extensive wall-paintings , now almost all lost .
PS3 was given the number-eight spot on PC World magazine 's list of " The Top 21 Tech Screwups of 2006 " , where it was criticized for being " Late , Expensive and Incompatible " . GamesRadar ranked PS3 as the top item in a feature on game-related PR disasters , asking how Sony managed to " take one of the most anticipated game systems of all time and — within the space of a year — turn it into a hate object reviled by the entire internet " , but added that despite its problems the system has " untapped potential " . Business Week summed up the general opinion by stating that it was " more impressed with what [ the PlayStation 3 ] could do than with what it currently does " .
The Sanskrit grammatical tradition , Vyākaraṇa , one of the six Vedangas , began in the late Vedic period and culminated in the Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini , which consists of 3990 sutras ( ca . fifth century BCE ) . About a century after Pāṇini ( around 400 BCE ) , Kātyāyana composed Vārtikas on the Pāṇini sũtras . Patanjali , who lived three centuries after Pāṇini , wrote the Mahābhāṣya , the " Great Commentary " on the Aṣṭādhyāyī and Vārtikas . Because of these three ancient Vyākaraṇins ( grammarians ) , this grammar is called Trimuni Vyākarana . To understand the meaning of the sutras , Jayaditya and Vāmana wrote a commentary , the Kāsikā , in 600 CE . Pāṇinian grammar is based on 14 Shiva sutras ( aphorisms ) , where the whole mātrika ( alphabet ) is abbreviated . This abbreviation is called the Pratyāhara .
With Egypt and Macedonia weakened , the Seleucid Empire made increasingly aggressive and successful attempts to conquer the entire Greek world . Now not only Rome 's allies against Philip , but even Philip himself , sought a Roman alliance against the Seleucids . The situation was made worse by the fact that Hannibal was now a chief military advisor to the Seleucid emperor , and the two were believed to be planning an outright conquest not just of Greece , but of Rome itself . The Seleucids were much stronger than the Macedonians had ever been , because they controlled much of the former Persian Empire , and by now had almost entirely reassembled Alexander the Great 's former empire .
Northwestern 's Evanston campus , where the undergraduate schools , the Graduate School , and the Kellogg School of Management are located , runs north-south from Lincoln Avenue to Clark Street west of Lake Michigan along Sheridan Road . North and South Campuses have noticeably different atmospheres , owing to the predominance of Science and Athletics in the one and Humanities and Arts in the other . North Campus is home to the fraternity quads , the Henry Crown Sports Pavilion and Norris Aquatics Center and other athletic facilities , the Technological Institute , Dearborn Observatory , and other science-related buildings including Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Hall for Nanofabrication and Molecular Self-Assembly , and the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center . South Campus is home to the University 's humanities buildings , Pick-Staiger Concert Hall and other music buildings , the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art , and the sorority quads . In the 1960s , the University created an additional 84 acres ( 34.0 ha ) by means of a lakefill in Lake Michigan . Among some of the buildings located on these broad new acres are University Library , Norris University Center ( the student union ) , and Pick-Staiger Concert Hall .
Mendes revealed that production would begin on 8 December 2014 at Pinewood Studios , with filming taking seven months . Mendes also confirmed several filming locations , including London , Mexico City and Rome . Van Hoytema shot the film on Kodak 35 mm film stock . Early filming took place at Pinewood Studios , and around London , with scenes variously featuring Craig and Harris at Bond 's flat , and Craig and Kinnear travelling down the River Thames .
Citing the inability of the Joint Commission to make progress , the U.S. government decided to hold an election under United Nations auspices with the aim of creating an independent Korea . The Soviet authorities and the Korean Communists refused to co-operate on the grounds it would not be fair , and many South Korean politicians also boycotted it . A general election was held in the South on 10 May 1948 . It was marred by terrorism and sabotage resulting in 600 deaths . North Korea held parliamentary elections three months later on 25 August .
The French breech-loading rifle , the Chassepot , had a far longer range than the German needle gun ; 1,500 yards ( 1,400 m ) compared to 600 yd ( 550 m ) . The French also had an early machine-gun type weapon , the mitrailleuse , which could fire its thirty-seven barrels at a range of around 1,200 yd ( 1,100 m ) . It was developed in such secrecy , that little training with the weapon had occurred , leaving French gunners with no experience ; the gun was treated like artillery and in this role it was ineffective . Worse still , once the small number of soldiers who had been trained how to use the new weapon became casualties , there were no replacements who knew how to operate the mitrailleuse .
As of 21 February 2016 [ update ] Spectre has grossed $ 879.3 million worldwide ; $ 138.1 million of the takings have been generated from the UK market and $ 199.8 million from North America .
While outer space provides the most rarefied example of a naturally occurring partial vacuum , the heavens were originally thought to be seamlessly filled by a rigid indestructible material called aether . Borrowing somewhat from the pneuma of Stoic physics , aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name , ( see Aether ( mythology ) ) . Early theories of light posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated . Additionally , the concept informed Isaac Newton 's explanations of both refraction and of radiant heat . 19th century experiments into this luminiferous aether attempted to detect a minute drag on the Earth 's orbit . While the Earth does , in fact , move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space , the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected . In 1912 , astronomer Henry Pickering commented : " While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether , [ it ] is characteristic of a gas , and free gaseous molecules are certainly there " .
One of the most important developments that the Enlightenment era brought to the discipline of science was its popularization . An increasingly literate population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning . The new literate population was due to a high rise in the availability of food . This enabled many people to rise out of poverty , and instead of paying more for food , they had money for education . Popularization was generally part of an overarching Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured " to make information available to the greatest number of people . " As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century , public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies . More formal works included explanations of scientific theories for individuals lacking the educational background to comprehend the original scientific text . Sir Isaac Newton 's celebrated Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until Enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular .
The Germanic languages are traditionally divided into three groups : West , East and North Germanic . They remained mutually intelligible throughout the Migration Period . Dutch is together with English and German part of the West Germanic group , that is characterized by a number of phonological and morphological innovations not found in North and East Germanic . The West Germanic varieties of the time are generally split into three dialect groups : Ingvaeonic ( North Sea Germanic ) , Istvaeonic ( Weser-Rhine Germanic ) and Irminonic ( Elbe Germanic ) . It appears that the Frankish tribes fit primarily into the Istvaeonic dialect group with certain Ingvaeonic influences towards the northwest , still seen in modern Dutch .
Nasser 's nomination for the post and the new constitution were put to public referendum on 23 June and each was approved by an overwhelming majority . A 350-member National Assembly was established , elections for which were held in July 1957 . Nasser had ultimate approval over all the candidates . The constitution granted women 's suffrage , prohibited gender-based discrimination , and entailed special protection for women in the workplace . Coinciding with the new constitution and Nasser 's presidency , the RCC dissolved itself and its members resigned their military commissions as part of the transition to civilian rule . During the deliberations surrounding the establishment of a new government , Nasser began a process of sidelining his rivals among the original Free Officers , while elevating his closest allies to high-ranking positions in the cabinet .
Jewish historians also note that certain customs of today 's Orthodox are not continuations of past practice , but instead represent innovations that would have been unknown to prior generations . For example , the now-widespread haredi tradition of cutting a boy 's hair for the first time on his third birthday ( upshirin or upsheerin , Yiddish for " haircut " ) " originated as an Arab custom that parents cut a newborn boy 's hair and burned it in a fire as a sacrifice , " and " Jews in Palestine learned this custom from Arabs and adapted it to a special Jewish context . " The Ashkenazi prohibition against eating kitniyot ( grains and legumes such as rice , corn , beans , and peanuts ) during Passover was explicitly rejected in the Talmud , has no known precedent before the 12th century and represented a minority position for hundreds of years thereafter , but nonetheless has remained a mandatory prohibition among Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews due to their historic adherence to the ReMA 's rulings in the Shulchan Aruch .
The Grands Magasins Dufayel was a huge department store with inexpensive prices built in 1890 in the northern part of Paris , where it reached a very large new customer base in the working class . In a neighborhood with few public spaces , it provided a consumer version of the public square . It educated workers to approach shopping as an exciting social activity not just a routine exercise in obtaining necessities , just as the bourgeoisie did at the famous department stores in the central city . Like the bourgeois stores , it helped transform consumption from a business transaction into a direct relationship between consumer and sought-after goods . Its advertisements promised the opportunity to participate in the newest , most fashionable consumerism at reasonable cost . The latest technology was featured , such as cinemas and exhibits of inventions like X-ray machines ( that could be used to fit shoes ) and the gramophone .
Israeli universities are among 100 top world universities in mathematics ( Hebrew University , TAU and Technion ) , physics ( TAU , Hebrew University and Weizmann Institute of Science ) , chemistry ( Technion and Weizmann Institute of Science ) , computer science ( Weizmann Institute of Science , Technion , Hebrew University , TAU and BIU ) and economics ( Hebrew University and TAU ) . Israel has produced six Nobel Prize-winning scientists since 2002 and has been frequently ranked as one of the countries with the highest ratios of scientific papers per capita in the world . Israel has led the world in stem-cell research papers per capita since 2000 .
Most early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs , and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0–31 with more graphics . Kaypro CP/M computers used the " upper " 128 characters for the Greek alphabet . The IBM PC defined code page 437 , which replaced the control-characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces , and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions . Operating systems such as DOS supported these code pages , and manufacturers of IBM PCs supported them in hardware . Digital Equipment Corporation developed the Multinational Character Set ( DEC-MCS ) for use in the popular VT220 terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics . The Macintosh defined Mac OS Roman and Postscript also defined a set , both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics , more like modern character sets .
Though they have not had the level of exposure as other wrestlers , bears have long been a part of professional wrestling . Usually declawed and muzzled , they often wrestled shoot matches against audience members , offered a cash reward if they could pin the bear . They also wrestled professionals in worked , often battle royal or handicap , matches ( usually booked so the bear won ) . Though they have wrestled around the world and continue to do so , wrestling bears enjoyed their greatest popularity in the Southern United States , during the 1960s and 1970s . The practice of bear wrestling has met strong opposition from animal rights activists in recent decades , contributing to its lack of mainstream acceptance . As of 2006 , it is banned in 20 U.S. states . Perhaps the most famous wrestling bears are Ginger , Victor , Hercules and Terrible Ted .
Following the success of season one , the second season was moved up to air in January 2003 . The number of episodes increased , as did the show 's budget and the charge for commercial spots . Dunkleman left the show , leaving Seacrest as the lone host . Kristin Adams was a correspondent for this season .
After Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 , the Wehrmacht crossed the Estonian southern border on 7 July . The Red Army retreated behind the Pärnu River – Emajõgi line on 12 July . At the end of July the Germans resumed their advance in Estonia working in tandem with the Estonian Forest Brothers . Both German troops and Estonian partisans took Narva on 17 August and the Estonian capital Tallinn on 28 August . After the Soviets were driven out from Estonia , German troops disarmed all the partisan groups .
Although the Palaeologi emperors recaptured Constantinople from the Western Europeans in 1261 , they were never able to regain control of much of the former imperial lands . They usually controlled only a small section of the Balkan Peninsula near Constantinople , the city itself , and some coastal lands on the Black Sea and around the Aegean Sea . The former Byzantine lands in the Balkans were divided between the new Kingdom of Serbia , the Second Bulgarian Empire and the city-state of Venice . The power of the Byzantine emperors was threatened by a new Turkish tribe , the Ottomans , who established themselves in Anatolia in the 13th century and steadily expanded throughout the 14th century . The Ottomans expanded into Europe , reducing Bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over Serbia after its defeat at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 . Western Europeans rallied to the plight of the Christians in the Balkans and declared a new crusade in 1396 ; a great army was sent to the Balkans , where it was defeated at the Battle of Nicopolis . Constantinople was finally captured by the Ottomans in 1453 .
Cyclone Bebe in 1972 caused severe damage to Funafuti . Funafuti 's Tepuka Vili Vili islet was devastated by Cyclone Meli in 1979 , with all its vegetation and most of its sand swept away during the cyclone . Along with a tropical depression that affected the islands a few days later , Severe Tropical Cyclone Ofa had a major impact on Tuvalu with most islands reporting damage to vegetation and crops . Cyclone Gavin was first identified during 2 March 1997 , and was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1996–97 cyclone season with Cyclones Hina and Keli following later in the season .
As the Ottoman Empire gradually shrank in size , some 7–9 million Turkish-Muslims from its former territories in the Caucasus , Crimea , Balkans , and the Mediterranean islands migrated to Anatolia and Eastern Thrace . After the Empire lost the Balkan Wars ( 1912–13 ) , it lost all its Balkan territories except East Thrace ( European Turkey ) . This resulted in around 400,000 Muslims fleeing with the retreating Ottoman armies ( with many dying from cholera brought by the soldiers ) , and with some 400,000 non-Muslims fleeing territory still under Ottoman rule . Justin McCarthy estimates that during the period 1821 to 1922 several million Muslims died in the Balkans , with the expulsion of a similar number .

Each species of pathogen has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts . Some organisms , such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus , can cause skin infections , pneumonia , meningitis and even overwhelming sepsis , a systemic inflammatory response producing shock , massive vasodilation and death . Yet these organisms are also part of the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all . Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans , such as the Rickettsia , which are obligate intracellular parasites able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms . One species of Rickettsia causes typhus , while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever . Chlamydia , another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites , contains species that can cause pneumonia , or urinary tract infection and may be involved in coronary heart disease . Finally , some species , such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Burkholderia cenocepacia , and Mycobacterium avium , are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis .
The Santa Monica Looff Hippodrome ( carousel ) is a National Historic Landmark . It sits on the Santa Monica Pier , which was built in 1909 . The La Monica Ballroom on the pier was once the largest ballroom in the US and the source for many New Year 's Eve national network broadcasts . The Santa Monica Civic Auditorium was an important music venue for several decades and hosted the Academy Awards in the 1960s . McCabe 's Guitar Shop is still a leading acoustic performance space as well as retail outlet . Bergamot Station is a city-owned art gallery compound that includes the Santa Monica Museum of Art . The city is also home to the California Heritage Museum and the Angels Attic dollhouse and toy museum .
Schwarzenegger was born with a bicuspid aortic valve , an aortic valve with only two leaflets ( a normal aortic valve has three leaflets ) . Schwarzenegger opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue ; medical experts predicted he would require heart valve replacement surgery in the following two to eight years as his valve would progressively degrade . Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve , the only permanent solution available at the time of his surgery , because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise .
After the meeting , Darwin decided to write " an abstract of my whole work " . He started work on 20 July 1858 , while on holiday at Sandown , and wrote parts of it from memory . Lyell discussed arrangements with publisher John Murray III , of the publishing house John Murray , who responded immediately to Darwin 's letter of 31 March 1859 with an agreement to publish the book without even seeing the manuscript , and an offer to Darwin of 2⁄3 of the profits . ( eventually Murray paid £180 to Darwin for the 1st edition and by Darwin 's death in 1882 the book was in its 6th edition , earning Darwin nearly £3000 . )
British post-punk entered the 1980s with support from members of the critical community—American critic Greil Marcus characterised " Britain 's postpunk pop avant-garde " in a 1980 Rolling Stone article as " sparked by a tension , humour and sense of paradox plainly unique in present day pop music " —as well as media figures such as BBC DJ John Peel , while several groups , such as PiL and Joy Division , achieved some success in the popular charts . The network of supportive record labels that included Industrial , Fast , E.G. , Mute , Axis/4AD and Glass continued to facilitate a large output of music , by artists such as the Raincoats , Essential Logic , Killing Joke , the Teardrop Explodes , and the Psychedelic Furs .
In the United Kingdom , the film grossed £4.1 million ( $ 6.4 million ) from its Monday preview screenings . It grossed £6.3 million ( $ 9.2 million ) on its opening day and then £5.7 million ( $ 8.8 million ) on Wednesday , setting UK records for both days . In the film 's first seven days it grossed £41.7 million ( $ 63.8 million ) , breaking the UK record for highest first-week opening , set by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 's £23.88 million ( $ 36.9 million ) in 2004 . Its Friday–Saturday gross was £20.4 million ( $ 31.2 million ) compared to Skyfall 's £20.1 million ( $ 31 million ) . The film also broke the record for the best per-screen opening average with $ 110,000 , a record previously held by The Dark Knight with $ 100,200 . It has grossed a total of $ 136.3 million there . In the U.K. , it surpassed Avatar to become the country 's highest-grossing IMAX release ever with $ 10.09 million .
The casualties were horrible , especially for the attacking Prussian forces . A grand total of 20,163 German troops were killed , wounded or missing in action during the August 18 battle . The French losses were 7,855 killed and wounded along with 4,420 prisoners of war ( half of them were wounded ) for a total of 12,275 . While most of the Prussians fell under the French Chassepot rifles , most French fell under the Prussian Krupp shells . In a breakdown of the casualties , Frossard 's II Corps of the Army of the Rhine suffered 621 casualties while inflicting 4,300 casualties on the Prussian First Army under Steinmetz before the Pointe du Jour . The Prussian Guards Infantry Divisions losses were even more staggering with 8,000 casualties out of 18,000 men . The Special Guards Jäger lost 19 officers , a surgeon and 431 men out of a total of 700 . The 2nd Guards Infantry Brigade lost 39 officers and 1,076 men . The 3rd Guards Infantry Brigade lost 36 officers and 1,060 men . On the French side , the units holding St. Privat lost more than half their number in the village .
In 1637 a small party of Puritans reconnoitered the New Haven harbor area and wintered over . In April 1638 , the main party of five hundred Puritans who left the Massachusetts Bay Colony under the leadership of the Reverend John Davenport and the London merchant Theophilus Eaton sailed into the harbor . These settlers were hoping to establish a ( in their mind ) better theological community , with the government more closely linked to the church than the one they left in Massachusetts and sought to take advantage of the excellent port capabilities of the harbor . The Quinnipiacs , who were under attack by neighboring Pequots , sold their land to the settlers in return for protection .
Southampton Airport is a regional airport located in the town of Eastleigh , just north of the city . It offers flights to UK and near European destinations , and is connected to the city by a frequent rail service from Southampton Airport ( Parkway ) railway station , and by bus services .
Miami is also considered a " hot spot " for dance music , Freestyle , a style of dance music popular in the 80 's and 90 's heavily influenced by Electro , hip-hop , and disco . Many popular Freestyle acts such as Pretty Tony , Debbie Deb , Stevie B , and Exposé , originated in Miami . Indie/folk acts Cat Power and Iron & Wine are based in the city , while alternative hip hop artist Sage Francis , electro artist Uffie , and the electroclash duo Avenue D were born in Miami , but musically based elsewhere . Also , ska punk band Against All Authority is from Miami , and rock/metal bands Nonpoint and Marilyn Manson each formed in neighboring Fort Lauderdale . Cuban American female recording artist , Ana Cristina , was born in Miami in 1985 .
Burke believed the Government was not taking the uprising seriously enough , a view reinforced by a letter he had received from the Prince Charles of France ( S.A.R . le comte d'Artois ) , dated 23 October , requesting that he intercede on behalf of the royalists to the Government . Burke was forced to reply on 6 November : " I am not in His Majesty 's Service ; or at all consulted in his Affairs " . Burke published his Remarks on the Policy of the Allies with Respect to France , begun in October , where he said : " I am sure every thing has shewn us that in this war with France , one Frenchman is worth twenty foreigners . La Vendée is a proof of this " .
The core technology used in a videoconferencing system is digital compression of audio and video streams in real time . The hardware or software that performs compression is called a codec ( coder/decoder ) . Compression rates of up to 1:500 can be achieved . The resulting digital stream of 1s and 0s is subdivided into labeled packets , which are then transmitted through a digital network of some kind ( usually ISDN or IP ) . The use of audio modems in the transmission line allow for the use of POTS , or the Plain Old Telephone System , in some low-speed applications , such as videotelephony , because they convert the digital pulses to/from analog waves in the audio spectrum range .
Three weeks later , on May 5 , 1961 , Alan Shepard became the first American in space , launched in a ballistic trajectory on Mercury-Redstone 3 , in a spacecraft he named Freedom 7 . Though he did not achieve orbit like Gagarin , he was the first person to exercise manual control over his spacecraft 's attitude and retro-rocket firing . After his successful return , Shepard was celebrated as a national hero , honored with parades in Washington , New York and Los Angeles , and received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President John F.

On 28 April 2015 , the Iranian navy seized the Marshall Island-flagged MV Maersk Tigris near the Strait of Hormuz . The ship had been chartered by Germany 's Rickmers Ship Management , which stated that the ship contained no special cargo and no military weapons . The ship was reported to be under the control of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard according to the Pentagon . Tensions escallated in the region due to the intensifying of Saudi-led coalition attacks in Yemen . The Pentagon reported that the destroyer USS Farragut and a maritime reconnaissance aircraft were dispatched upon receiving a distress call from the ship Tigris and it was also reported that all 34 crew members were detained . US defense officials have said that they would review U.S. defense obligations to the Government of the Marshall Islands in the wake of recent events and also condemned the shots fired at the bridge as " inappropriate " . It was reported in May 2015 that Tehran would release the ship after it paid a penalty .
Today , the system of Arabic and Islamic education has grown and further integrated with Kerala government administration . In 2005 , an estimated 6,000 Muslim Arabic teachers taught in Kerala government schools , with over 500,000 Muslim students . State-appointed committees , not private mosques or religious scholars outside the government , determine the curriculum and accreditation of new schools and colleges . Primary education in Arabic and Islamic studies is available to Kerala Muslims almost entirely in after-school madrasa programs - sharply unlike full-time madaris common in north India , which may replace formal schooling . Arabic colleges ( over eleven of which exist within the state-run University of Calicut and the Kannur University ) provide B.A . and Masters ' level degrees . At all levels , instruction is co-educational , with many women instructors and professors . Islamic education boards are independently run by the following organizations , accredited by the Kerala state government : Samastha Kerala Islamic Education Board , Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen , Jamaat-e-Islami Hind , and Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind .
The Liberal Party 's organisation is dominated by the six state divisions , reflecting the party 's original commitment to a federalised system of government ( a commitment which was strongly maintained by all Liberal governments until 1983 , but was to a large extent abandoned by the Howard Government , which showed strong centralising tendencies ) . Menzies deliberately created a weak national party machine and strong state divisions . Party policy is made almost entirely by the parliamentary parties , not by the party 's rank-and-file members , although Liberal party members do have a degree of influence over party policy .
After 12 years as commissioner of the AFL , David Baker retired unexpectedly on July 25 , 2008 , just two days before ArenaBowl XXII ; deputy commissioner Ed Policy was named interim commissioner until Baker 's replacement was found . Baker explained , " When I took over as commissioner , I thought it would be for one year . It turned into 12 . But now it 's time . "
Portugal maintains a unitary semi-presidential republican form of government and is a developed country with an advanced economy , and a high living standard , having the 18th highest Social Progress in the world , putting it ahead of other Western European countries like France , Spain and Italy . It is a member of numerous international organizations , including the United Nations , the European Union , the Eurozone , OECD , NATO and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries . Portugal is also known for having decriminalized the usage of all common drugs in 2001 , the first country in the world to do so . However , drugs are still illegal in Portugal .
The Díaz administration made political decisions and took legal measures that allowed the elite throughout Mexico to concentrate the nation 's wealth by favoring monopolies . During this time , two-fifths of the state 's territory was divided among 17 rich families which owned practically all of the arable land in Chihuahua . The state economy grew at a rapid pace during the Porfiriato ; the economy in Chihuahua was dominated by agriculture and mining . The Díaz administration helped Governor Luis Terrazas by funding the Municipal Public Library in Chihuahua City and passing a federal initiative for the construction of the railroad from Chihuahua City to Ciudad Júarez . By 1881 , the Central Mexican Railroad was completed which connected Mexico City to Ciudad Juárez . In 1883 telephone lines were installed throughout the state , allowing communication between Chihuahua City and Aldama . By 1888 the telephone services were extended from the capital to the cites of Julimes , Meoqui , and Hidalgo del Parral ; the telecommunication network in the state covered an estimated 3,500 kilometers . The need of laborers to construct the extensive infrastructure projects resulted in a significant Asian immigration , mostly from China . Asian immigrants soon become integral to the state economy by opening restaurants , small grocery stores , and hotels . By the end of the Terrazas term , the state experienced an increase in commerce , mining , and banking . When the banks were nationalized , Chihuahua became the most important banking state in Mexico .
Wilhelm Erb 's ( 1874 ) " intensive " theory , that a pain signal can be generated by intense enough stimulation of any sensory receptor , has been soundly disproved . Some sensory fibers do not differentiate between noxious and non-noxious stimuli , while others , nociceptors , respond only to noxious , high intensity stimuli . At the peripheral end of the nociceptor , noxious stimuli generate currents that , above a given threshold , begin to send signals along the nerve fiber to the spinal cord . The " specificity " ( whether it responds to thermal , chemical or mechanical features of its environment ) of a nociceptor is determined by which ion channels it expresses at its peripheral end . Dozens of different types of nociceptor ion channels have so far been identified , and their exact functions are still being determined .
Banner Armies were organized along ethnic lines , namely Manchu and Mongol , but included non-Manchu bondservants registered under the household of their Manchu masters . The years leading up to the conquest increased the number of Han Chinese under Manchu rule , leading Hong Taiji to create the Eight Han Banners ( zh ) , and around the time of the Qing takeover of Beijing , their numbers rapidly swelled . Han Bannermen held high status and power in the early Qing period , especially immediately after the conquest during Shunzhi and Kangxi 's reign where they dominated Governor-Generalships and Governorships across China at the expense of both Manchu Bannermen and Han civilians . Han also numerically dominated the Banners up until the mid 18th century . European visitors in Beijing called them " Tartarized Chinese " or " Tartarified Chinese " . It was in Qianlong 's reign that the Qianlong Emperor , concerned about maintaining Manchu identity , re-emphasized Manchu ethnicity , ancestry , language , and culture in the Eight Banners and started a mass discharge of Han Bannermen from the Eight Banners , either asking them to voluntarily resign from the Banner rolls or striking their names off . This led to a change from Han majority to a Manchu majority within the Banner system , and previous Han Bannermen garrisons in southern China such as at Fuzhou , Zhenjiang , Guangzhou , were replaced by Manchu Bannermen in the purge , which started in 1754 . The turnover by Qianlong most heavily impacted Han banner garrisons stationed in the provinces while it less impacted Han Bannermen in Beijing , leaving a larger proportion of remaining Han Bannermen in Beijing than the provinces . Han Bannermen 's status was decreased from that point on with Manchu Banners gaining higher status . Han Bannermen numbered 75 % in 1648 Shunzhi 's reign , 72 % in 1723 Yongzheng 's reign , but decreased to 43 % in 1796 during the first year of Jiaqing 's reign , which was after Qianlong 's purge . The mass discharge was known as the Disbandment of the Han Banners ( zh ) . Qianlong directed most of his ire at those Han Bannermen descended from defectors who joined the Qing after the Qing passed through the Great Wall at Shanhai Pass in 1644 , deeming their ancestors as traitors to the Ming and therefore untrustworthy , while retaining Han Bannermen who were descended from defectors who joined the Qing before 1644 in Liaodong and marched through Shanhai pass , also known as those who " followed the Dragon through the pass " ( 從龍入關 ; cong long ru guan ) .
On 23 October 1501 , at Mielnik Polish–Lithuanian union was reformed at the Union of Mielnik ( Polish : unia mielnicka , unia piotrkowsko-mielnicka ) . It was there that the tradition of the coronation Sejm ( Polish : " Sejm koronacyjny " ) was founded . Once again the middle nobility ( middle in wealth , not in rank ) attempted to reduce the power of the magnates with a law that made them impeachable before the Senate for malfeasance . However the Act of Mielno ( Polish : Przywilej mielnicki ) of 25 October did more to strengthen the magnate dominated Senate of Poland then the lesser nobility . The nobles were given the right to disobey the King or his representatives—in the Latin , " non praestanda oboedientia " —and to form confederations , an armed rebellion against the king or state officers if the nobles thought that the law or their legitimate privileges were being infringed .
An endpoint of a pipe is addressable with a tuple ( device_address , endpoint_number ) as specified in a TOKEN packet that the host sends when it wants to start a data transfer session . If the direction of the data transfer is from the host to the endpoint , an OUT packet ( a specialization of a TOKEN packet ) having the desired device address and endpoint number is sent by the host . If the direction of the data transfer is from the device to the host , the host sends an IN packet instead . If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer 's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet ( e.g . the manufacturer 's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet ) , the TOKEN packet is ignored . Otherwise , it is accepted and the data transaction can start . A bi-directional endpoint , on the other hand , accepts both IN and OUT packets .
An important guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way ( or Middle Path ) , which is said to have been discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment . The Middle Way has several definitions :
In 1870 , republican sentiment in Britain , fed by the Queen 's seclusion , was boosted after the establishment of the Third French Republic . A republican rally in Trafalgar Square demanded Victoria 's removal , and Radical MPs spoke against her . In August and September 1871 , she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm , which Joseph Lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray . In late November 1871 , at the height of the republican movement , the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever , the disease that was believed to have killed his father , and Victoria was fearful her son would die . As the tenth anniversary of her husband 's death approached , her son 's condition grew no better , and Victoria 's distress continued . To general rejoicing , he pulled through . Mother and son attended a public parade through London and a grand service of thanksgiving in St Paul 's Cathedral on 27 February 1872 , and republican feeling subsided .
Roncalli was elected pope on 28 October 1958 at age 76 after 11 ballots . His selection was unexpected , and Roncalli himself had come to Rome with a return train ticket to Venice . He was the first pope to take the pontifical name of " John " upon election in more than 500 years , and his choice settled the complicated question of official numbering attached to this papal name due to the antipope of this name . Pope John XXIII surprised those who expected him to be a caretaker pope by calling the historic Second Vatican Council ( 1962–65 ) , the first session opening on 11 October 1962 . His passionate views on equality were summed up in his famous statement , " We were all made in God 's image , and thus , we are all Godly alike . " John XXIII made many passionate speeches during his pontificate , one of which was on the day that he opened the Second Vatican Council in the middle of the night to the crowd gathered in St. Peter 's Square : " Dear children , returning home , you will find children : give your children a hug and say : This is a hug from the Pope ! "
In September 2006 , the iTunes Store began to offer additional games for purchase with the launch of iTunes 7 , compatible with the fifth generation iPod with iPod software 1.2 or later . Those games were : Bejeweled , Cubis 2 , Mahjong , Mini Golf , Pac-Man , Tetris , Texas Hold 'Em , Vortex , Asphalt 4 : Elite Racing and Zuma . Additional games have since been added . These games work on the 6th and 5th generation iPod Classic and the 5th and 4th generation iPod Nano .
By the 1st century , Babylonia , to which Jews migrated to after the Babylonian conquest as well as after the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE , already held a speedily growing population of an estimated 1,000,000 Jews , which increased to an estimated 2 million between the years 200 CE – 500 CE , both by natural growth and by immigration of more Jews from the Land of Israel , making up about 1/6 of the world Jewish population at that era . At times conversion has accounted for a part of Jewish population growth . Some have claimed that in the 1st century of the Christian era , for example , the population more than doubled , from four to 8–10 million within the confines of the Roman Empire , in good part as a result of a wave of conversion .
Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man , Iron Man , Captain America , Wolverine , Thor , Hulk , Ant-Man , such teams as the Avengers , the Guardians of the Galaxy , the Fantastic Four , the Inhumans and the X-Men , and antagonists such as Doctor Doom , The Enchantress , Green Goblin , Ultron , Doctor Octopus , Thanos , Magneto and Loki . Most of Marvel 's fictional characters operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe , with locations that mirror real-life cities . Characters such as Spider-Man , the Fantastic Four , the Avengers , Daredevil and Doctor Strange are based in New York City , whereas the X-Men have historically been based in Salem Center , New York and Hulk 's stories often have been set in the American Southwest .
The 1923 general election was fought on the Conservatives ' protectionist proposals but , although they got the most votes and remained the largest party , they lost their majority in parliament , necessitating the formation of a government supporting free trade . Thus , with the acquiescence of Asquith 's Liberals , Ramsay MacDonald became the first ever Labour Prime Minister in January 1924 , forming the first Labour government , despite Labour only having 191 MPs ( less than a third of the House of Commons ) .
More than half of the Jews live in the Diaspora ( see Population table ) . Currently , the largest Jewish community outside Israel , and either the largest or second-largest Jewish community in the world , is located in the United States , with 5.2 million to 6.4 million Jews by various estimates . Elsewhere in the Americas , there are also large Jewish populations in Canada ( 315,000 ) , Argentina ( 180,000-300,000 ) , and Brazil ( 196,000-600,000 ) , and smaller populations in Mexico , Uruguay , Venezuela , Chile , Colombia and several other countries ( see History of the Jews in Latin America ) . Demographers disagree on whether the United States has a larger Jewish population than Israel , with many maintaining that Israel surpassed the United States in Jewish population during the 2000s , while others maintain that the United States still has the largest Jewish population in the world . Currently , a major national Jewish population survey is planned to ascertain whether or not Israel has overtaken the United States in Jewish population .
On release , Twilight Princess was considered to be the greatest Zelda game ever made by many critics including writers for 1UP.com , Computer and Video Games , Electronic Gaming Monthly , Game Informer , GamesRadar , IGN and The Washington Post . Game Informer called it " so creative that it rivals the best that Hollywood has to offer " . GamesRadar praised Twilight Princess as " a game that deserves nothing but the absolute highest recommendation " . Cubed3 hailed Twilight Princess as " the single greatest videogame experience " . Twilight Princess 's graphics were praised for the art style and animation , although the game was designed for the GameCube , which is technically lacking compared to the next generation consoles . Both IGN and GameSpy pointed out the existence of blurry textures and low-resolution characters . Despite these complaints , Computer and Video Games felt the game 's atmosphere was superior to that of any previous Zelda game , and regarded Twilight Princess 's Hyrule as the best version ever created . PALGN praised the game 's cinematics , noting that " the cutscenes are the best ever in Zelda games " . Regarding the Wii version , GameSpot 's Jeff Gerstmann said the Wii controls felt " tacked-on " , although 1UP.com said the remote-swinging sword attacks were " the most impressive in the entire series " . Gaming Nexus considered Twilight Princess 's soundtrack to be the best of this generation , though IGN criticized its MIDI-formatted songs for lacking " the punch and crispness " of their orchestrated counterparts . Hyper 's Javier Glickman commended the game for its " very long quests , superb Wii controls and being able to save anytime " . However , he criticised it for " no voice acting , no orchestral score and slightly outdated graphics " .
Many Islamic anti-Masonic arguments are closely tied to both antisemitism and Anti-Zionism , though other criticisms are made such as linking Freemasonry to al-Masih ad-Dajjal ( the false Messiah ) . Some Muslim anti-Masons argue that Freemasonry promotes the interests of the Jews around the world and that one of its aims is to destroy the Al-Aqsa Mosque in order to rebuild the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem . In article 28 of its Covenant , Hamas states that Freemasonry , Rotary , and other similar groups " work in the interest of Zionism and according to its instructions ... "
Throughout the course of its life , a number of peripherals were released which added to the functionality of the SNES . Many of these devices were modeled after earlier add-ons for the NES : the Super Scope is a light gun functionally similar to the NES Zapper ( though the Super Scope features wireless capabilities ) and the Super Advantage is an arcade-style joystick with adjustable turbo settings akin to the NES Advantage . Nintendo also released the SNES Mouse in conjunction with its Mario Paint title . Hudson Soft , under license from Nintendo , released the Super Multitap , a multiplayer adapter for use with its popular series of Bomberman games . Some of the more unusual controllers include the BatterUP baseball bat , the Life Fitness Entertainment System ( an exercise bike controller with built-in monitoring software ) , and the TeeV Golf golf club .
Celtic tribes settled in Switzerland between 1000 to 1500 BC . The Raetians lived in the eastern regions , while the west was occupied by the Helvetii and the Allobrogi settled in the Rhone valley and in Savoy . Among the many substances Celtic tribes mined was salt in areas such as Salzburg in Austria where evidence of the Hallstatt culture was found by a mine manager in the 19th century . By the 6th century BC the La Tène culture was well established in the region , and became known for high quality decorated weapons and jewelry . The Celts were the most widespread of the mountain tribes—they had warriors that were strong , tall and fair skinned skilled with iron weapons , which gave them an advantage in warfare .
The transition from the mandolino to the mandolin began around 1744 with the designing of the metal-string mandolin by the Vinaccia family , 3 brass strings and one of gut , using friction tuning pegs on a fingerboard that sat " flush " with the sound table . The mandolin grew in popularity over the next 60 years , in the streets where it was used by young men courting and by street musicians , and in the concert hall . After the Napoleonic Wars of 1815 , however , its popularity began to fall . The 19th century produced some prominent players , including Bartolomeo Bortolazzi of Venice and Pietro Vimercati . However , professional virtuosity was in decline , and the mandolin music changed as the mandolin became a folk instrument ; " the large repertoire of notated instrumental music for the mandolino and the mandoline was completely forgotten " . The export market for mandolins from Italy dried up around 1815 , and when Carmine de Laurentiis wrote a mandolin method in 1874 , the Music World magazine wrote that the mandolin was " out of date . " Salvador Léonardi mentioned this decline in his 1921 book , Méthode pour Banjoline ou Mandoline-Banjo , saying that the mandolin had been declining in popularity from previous times .
The origins of the department store lay in the growth of the conspicuous consumer society at the turn of the 19th century . As the Industrial Revolution accelerated economy expansion , the affluent middle-class grew in size and wealth . This urbanized social group , sharing a culture of consumption and changing fashion , was the catalyst for the retail revolution . As rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people , especially women ( who found they could shop unaccompanied at department stores without damaging their reputation ) , with disposable income in the late Georgian period , window shopping was transformed into a leisure activity and entrepreneurs , like the potter Josiah Wedgwood , pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence the prevailing tastes and preferences of society .
The term Ashkenazi also refers to the nusach Ashkenaz ( Hebrew , " liturgical tradition " , or rite ) used by Ashkenazi Jews in their Siddur ( prayer book ) . A nusach is defined by a liturgical tradition 's choice of prayers , order of prayers , text of prayers and melodies used in the singing of prayers . Two other major forms of nusach among Ashkenazic Jews are Nusach Sefard ( not to be confused with the Sephardic ritual ) , which is the general Polish Hasidic nusach , and Nusach Ari , as used by Lubavitch Hasidim .
In contrast , some emerging software disciplines such as extreme programming and the agile software development movement , adhere to a " test-driven software development " model . In this process , unit tests are written first , by the software engineers ( often with pair programming in the extreme programming methodology ) . Of course these tests fail initially ; as they are expected to . Then as code is written it passes incrementally larger portions of the test suites . The test suites are continuously updated as new failure conditions and corner cases are discovered , and they are integrated with any regression tests that are developed . Unit tests are maintained along with the rest of the software source code and generally integrated into the build process ( with inherently interactive tests being relegated to a partially manual build acceptance process ) . The ultimate goal of this test process is to achieve continuous integration where software updates can be published to the public frequently .
These areas contain some spectacular scenery as well , as evidenced by such national parks as Yosemite and Mount Rainier . West of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada is a series of valleys , such as the Central Valley in California and the Willamette Valley in Oregon . Along the coast is a series of low mountain ranges known as the Pacific Coast Ranges . Much of the Pacific Northwest coast is inhabited by some of the densest vegetation outside of the Tropics , and also the tallest trees in the world ( the Redwoods ) .
Office buildings in Shanghai 's financial district , including the Jin Mao Tower and the Hong Kong New World Tower , were evacuated . A receptionist at the Tibet Hotel in Chengdu said things were " calm " after the hotel evacuated its guests . Meanwhile , workers at a Ford plant in Sichuan were evacuated for about 10 minutes . Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport was shut down , and the control tower and regional radar control evacuated . One SilkAir flight was diverted and landed in Kunming as a result . Cathay Pacific delayed both legs of its quadruple daily Hong Kong to London route due to this disruption in air traffic services . Chengdu Shuangliu Airport reopened later on the evening of May 12 , offering limited service as the airport began to be used as a staging area for relief operations .
At the time of the Roman Empire , about two thousand years ago , various tribes , which spoke Celtic dialects of the Insular Celtic group , were inhabiting the islands . The Romans expanded their civilisation to control southern Great Britain but were impeded in advancing any further , building Hadrian 's Wall to mark the northern frontier of their empire in 122 AD . At that time , Ireland was populated by a people known as Hiberni , the northern third or so of Great Britain by a people known as Picts and the southern two thirds by Britons .
Electrocution was the preferred method of execution during the 20th century . Electric chairs have commonly been nicknamed Old Sparky ; however , Alabama 's electric chair became known as the " Yellow Mama " due to its unique color . Some , particularly in Florida , were noted for malfunctions , which caused discussion of their cruelty and resulted in a shift to lethal injection as the preferred method of execution . Although lethal injection dominates as a method of execution , some states allow prisoners on death row to choose the method used to execute them .
The historical study of Cubism began in the late 1920s , drawing at first from sources of limited data , namely the opinions of Guillaume Apollinaire . It came to rely heavily on Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler 's book Der Weg zum Kubismus ( published in 1920 ) , which centered on the developments of Picasso , Braque , Léger , and Gris . The terms " analytical " and " synthetic " which subsequently emerged have been widely accepted since the mid-1930s . Both terms are historical impositions that occurred after the facts they identify . Neither phase was designated as such at the time corresponding works were created . " If Kahnweiler considers Cubism as Picasso and Braque , " wrote Daniel Robbins , " our only fault is in subjecting other Cubists ' works to the rigors of that limited definition . "
In 2006 , Morgan Stanley purchased 20 acres ( 8.1 ha ) directly north of the Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino for a new $ 2 billion plus casino resort . Revel Entertainment Group was named as the project 's developer for the Revel Casino . Revel was hindered with many problems , with the biggest setback to the company being in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley , the owner of 90 % of Revel Entertainment Group , decided to discontinue funding for continued construction and put its stake in Revel up for sale . Early in 2010 the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill offering tax incentives to attract new investors and complete the job , but a poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University 's PublicMind released in March 2010 showed that three of five voters ( 60 % ) opposed the legislation , and two of three of those who opposed it " strongly " opposed it . Ultimately , Governor Chris Christie offered Revel $ 261 million in state tax credits to assist the casino once it opened . As of March 2011 [ update ] , Revel had completed all of the exterior work and had continued work on the interior after finally receiving the funding necessary to complete construction . It had a soft opening in April 2012 , and was fully open by May 2012 . Ten months later , in February 2013 , after serious losses and a write-down in the value of the resort from $ 2.4 billion to $ 450 million , Revel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy . It was restructured but still could not carry on and re-entered bankruptcy on June 19 , 2014 . It was put up for sale , however as no suitable bids were received the resort closed its doors on September 2 , 2014 .
Finalist Phillip Phillips suffered from kidney pain and was taken to the hospital before the Top 13 results show , and later received medical procedure to alleviate a blockage caused by kidney stones . He was reported to have eight surgeries during his Idol run , and had considered quitting the show due to the pain . He underwent surgery to remove the stones and reconstruct his kidney soon after the season had finished .
German beacons operated on the medium-frequency band and the signals involved a two-letter Morse identifier followed by a lengthy time-lapse which enabled the Luftwaffe crews to determine the signal 's bearing . The Meacon system involved separate locations for a receiver with a directional aerial and a transmitter . The receipt of the German signal by the receiver was duly passed to the transmitter , the signal to be repeated . The action did not guarantee automatic success . If the German bomber flew closer to its own beam than the Meacon then the former signal would come through the stronger on the direction finder . The reverse would apply only if the meacon were closer .
In a grounded-emitter transistor circuit , such as the light-switch circuit shown , as the base voltage rises , the emitter and collector currents rise exponentially . The collector voltage drops because of reduced resistance from collector to emitter . If the voltage difference between the collector and emitter were zero ( or near zero ) , the collector current would be limited only by the load resistance ( light bulb ) and the supply voltage . This is called saturation because current is flowing from collector to emitter freely . When saturated , the switch is said to be on .
Since the 1979 Revolution , to overcome foreign embargoes , Iran has developed its own military industry , produced its own tanks , armored personnel carriers , guided missiles , submarines , military vessels , guided missile destroyer , radar systems , helicopters and fighter planes . In recent years , official announcements have highlighted the development of weapons such as the Hoot , Kowsar , Zelzal , Fateh-110 , Shahab-3 and Sejjil missiles , and a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) . The Fajr-3 ( MIRV ) is currently Iran 's most advanced ballistic missile , it is a liquid fuel missile with an undisclosed range which was developed and produced domestically .
The OTG device with the A-plug inserted is called the A-device and is responsible for powering the USB interface when required and by default assumes the role of host . The OTG device with the B-plug inserted is called the B-device and by default assumes the role of peripheral . An OTG device with no plug inserted defaults to acting as a B-device . If an application on the B-device requires the role of host , then the Host Negotiation Protocol ( HNP ) is used to temporarily transfer the host role to the B-device .
A large Russian assault on the allied supply base to the southeast , at Balaclava was rebuffed on 25 October 1854.:521–527 The Battle of Balaclava is remembered in the UK for the actions of two British units . At the start of the battle , a large body of Russian cavalry charged the 93rd Highlanders , who were posted north of the village of Kadikoi . Commanding them was Sir Colin Campbell . Rather than 'form square ' , the traditional method of repelling cavalry , Campbell took the risky decision to have his Highlanders form a single line , two men deep . Campbell had seen the effectiveness of the new Minie rifles , with which his troops were armed , at the Battle of the Alma a month before , and was confident his men could beat back the Russians . His tactics succeeded . From up on the ridge to the west , Times correspondent William Howard Russell saw the Highlanders as a 'thin red streak topped with steel ' , a phrase which soon became the 'Thin Red Line . '
By 2013 , Madonna 's Raising Malawi organization built ten schools to educate 4,000 children in Malawi at a value of $ 400,000 . When Madonna visited the schools in April 2013 , President of Malawi Joyce Banda expressed criticism of the star and her charity , accusing her of exaggerating her charity 's contribution . Madonna responded by releasing a statement saying she was saddened that Banda had chosen to act negatively about her endeavors . " I have no intention of being distracted by these ridiculous allegations , " she added . Later , it was confirmed that Banda had not approved the statement released written by her press team and was " incandescent with anger " over the mix-up .
Until recently , in most critical writing the post-punk era was " often dismissed as an awkward period in which punk 's gleeful ructions petered out into the vacuity of the Eighties " . Contemporary scholars have argued to the contrary , asserting that the period produced significant innovations and music on its own . Simon Reynolds described the period as " a fair match for the sixties in terms of the sheer amount of great music created , the spirit of adventure and idealism that infused it , and the way that the music seemed inextricably connected to the political and social turbulence of its era " . Nicholas Lezard wrote that the music of the period " was avant-garde , open to any musical possibilities that suggested themselves , united only in the sense that it was very often cerebral , concocted by brainy young men and women interested as much in disturbing the audience , or making them think , as in making a pop song " .
The Czechs ' language separated from other Slavic tongues into what would later be called Old Czech by the thirteenth century , a classification extending through the sixteenth century . Its use of cases differed from the modern language ; although Old Czech did not yet have a vocative case or an animacy distinction , declension for its six cases and three genders rapidly became complicated ( partially to differentiate homophones ) and its declension patterns resembled those of Lithuanian ( its Balto-Slavic cousin ) .
In the Parliament of the United Kingdom , Plymouth is represented by the three constituencies of Plymouth Moor View , Plymouth Sutton and Devonport and South West Devon and within the European Parliament as South West England . In the 2015 general election all three constituencies returned Conservative MPs , who were Oliver Colvile ( for Devon South West ) , Gary Streeter ( for Sutton and Devonport ) and Johnny Mercer for Moor View .
Between Second and Third Avenues , 21st Street is alternatively known as Police Officer Anthony Sanchez Way . Along the northern perimeter of Gramercy Park , between Gramercy Park East and Gramercy Park West , 21st Street is known as Gramercy Park North .
Following the earthquake , donations were made by people from all over mainland China , with booths set up in schools , at banks , and around gas stations . People also donated blood , resulting in according to Xinhua long line-ups in most major Chinese cities . Many donated through text messaging on mobile phones to accounts set up by China Unicom and China Mobile By May 16 , the Chinese government had allocated a total of $ 772 million for earthquake relief so far , up sharply from $ 159 million from May 14 .
One of the more prominent contestants this year was Chris Medina , whose story of caring for his brain-damaged fiancée received widespread coverage . Medina was cut in the Top 40 round . Casey Abrams , who suffers from ulcerative colitis , was hospitalized twice and missed the Top 13 result show . The judges used their one save on Abrams on the Top 11 , and as a result this was the first season that 11 finalists went on tour instead of 10 . In the following week , Naima Adedapo and Thia Megia were both eliminated the following week .
The German rocket center in Peenemünde was located in the eastern part of Germany , which became the Soviet zone of occupation . On Stalin 's orders , the Soviet Union sent its best rocket engineers to this region to see what they could salvage for future weapons systems . The Soviet rocket engineers were led by Sergei Korolev . He had been involved in space clubs and early Soviet rocket design in the 1930s , but was arrested in 1938 during Joseph Stalin 's Great Purge and imprisoned for six years in Siberia . After the war , he became the USSR 's chief rocket and spacecraft engineer , essentially the Soviet counterpart to von Braun . His identity was kept a state secret throughout the Cold War , and he was identified publicly only as " the Chief Designer . " In the West , his name was only officially revealed when he died in 1966 .
Washington University has been selected by the Commission on Presidential Debates to host more presidential and vice-presidential debates than any other institution in history . United States presidential election debates were held at the Washington University Athletic Complex in 1992 , 2000 , 2004 , and 2016 . A presidential debate was planned to occur in 1996 , but owing to scheduling difficulties between the candidates , the debate was canceled . The university hosted the only 2008 vice presidential debate , between Republican Sarah Palin and Democrat Joe Biden , on October 2 , 2008 , also at the Washington University Athletic Complex .
These studies suggest that men and women are different in terms of sexual arousal patterns and that this is also reflected in how their genitals react to sexual stimuli of both genders or even to non-human stimuli . Sexual orientation has many dimensions ( attractions , behavior , identity ) , of which sexual arousal is the only product of sexual attractions which can be measured at present with some degree of physical precision . Thus , the fact that women are aroused by seeing non-human primates having sex does not mean that women 's sexual orientation includes this type of sexual interest . Some researchers argue that women 's sexual orientation depends less on their patterns of sexual arousal than men 's and that other components of sexual orientation ( like emotional attachment ) must be taken into account when describing women 's sexual orientations . In contrast , men 's sexual orientations tend to be primarily focused on the physical component of attractions and , thus , their sexual feelings are more exclusively oriented according to sex .
Writings in Estonian became significant only in the 19th century with the spread of the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment , during the Estophile Enlightenment Period ( 1750–1840 ) . Although Baltic Germans at large regarded the future of Estonians as being a fusion with themselves , the Estophile educated class admired the ancient culture of the Estonians and their era of freedom before the conquests by Danes and Germans in the 13th century .
The Xeer legal system is assumed to have developed exclusively in the Horn of Africa since approximately the 7th century . There is no evidence that it developed elsewhere or was greatly influenced by any foreign legal system . The fact that Somali legal terminology is practically devoid of loan words from foreign languages suggests that Xeer is truly indigenous .
Detroit is the center of a three-county urban area ( population 3,734,090 , area of 1,337 square miles ( 3,460 km2 ) , a 2010 United States Census ) six-county metropolitan statistical area ( 2010 Census population of 4,296,250 , area of 3,913 square miles [ 10,130 km2 ] ) , and a nine-county Combined Statistical Area ( 2010 Census population of 5,218,852 , area of 5,814 square miles [ 15,060 km2 ] ) . The Detroit–Windsor area , a commercial link straddling the Canada–U.S . border , has a total population of about 5,700,000 . The Detroit metropolitan region holds roughly one-half of Michigan 's population .
France used the right moment and occupied Alger in 1830 . In 1831 Muhammad Ali of Egypt , who was the most powerful vassal of the Ottoman Empire , claimed independence . Ottoman forces were defeated in a number of battles , and Egyptians were ready to capture Constantinople , which forced the sultan Mahmud II to seek for Russian military aid . 10 000 Russian army corps landed on the Bosphorus shores in 1833 and helped to prevent the capture of Constantinople , thus the possible disappearance of the Ottoman Empire was prevented .
In 121 BC , Rome came into contact with two Celtic tribes ( from a region in modern France ) , both of which they defeated with apparent ease . The Cimbrian War ( 113–101 BC ) was a far more serious affair than the earlier clashes of 121 BC . The Germanic tribes of the Cimbri and the Teutons migrated from northern Europe into Rome 's northern territories , and clashed with Rome and her allies . At the Battle of Aquae Sextiae and the Battle of Vercellae both tribes were virtually annihilated , which ended the threat .
The study of plants is vital because they underpin almost all animal life on Earth by generating a large proportion of the oxygen and food that provide humans and other organisms with aerobic respiration with the chemical energy they need to exist . Plants , algae and cyanobacteria are the major groups of organisms that carry out photosynthesis , a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars that can be used both as a source of chemical energy and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells . As a by-product of photosynthesis , plants release oxygen into the atmosphere , a gas that is required by nearly all living things to carry out cellular respiration . In addition , they are influential in the global carbon and water cycles and plant roots bind and stabilise soils , preventing soil erosion . Plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food , oxygen , medicine , and products for people , as well as creating and preserving soil .
A series of experiments performed from the late 1800s to the early 1900s revealed that diabetes is caused by the absence of a substance normally produced by the pancreas . In 1869 , Oskar Minkowski and Joseph von Mering found that diabetes could be induced in dogs by surgical removal of the pancreas . In 1921 , Canadian professor Frederick Banting and his student Charles Best repeated this study , and found that injections of pancreatic extract reversed the symptoms produced by pancreas removal . Soon , the extract was demonstrated to work in people , but development of insulin therapy as a routine medical procedure was delayed by difficulties in producing the material in sufficient quantity and with reproducible purity . The researchers sought assistance from industrial collaborators at Eli Lilly and Co. based on the company 's experience with large scale purification of biological materials . Chemist George Walden of Eli Lilly and Company found that careful adjustment of the pH of the extract allowed a relatively pure grade of insulin to be produced . Under pressure from Toronto University and a potential patent challenge by academic scientists who had independently developed a similar purification method , an agreement was reached for non-exclusive production of insulin by multiple companies . Prior to the discovery and widespread availability of insulin therapy the life expectancy of diabetics was only a few months .
In 1845 , Ireland was hit by a potato blight . In the next four years over a million Irish people died and another million emigrated in what became known as the Great Famine . In Ireland , Victoria was labelled " The Famine Queen " . She personally donated £2,000 to famine relief , more than any other individual donor , and also supported the Maynooth Grant to a Roman Catholic seminary in Ireland , despite Protestant opposition . The story that she donated only £5 in aid to the Irish , and on the same day gave the same amount to Battersea Dogs Home , was a myth generated towards the end of the 19th century .
In the autumn of 1913 , he was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army . He was sent to a school for non-commissioned officers and became a sergeant , serving in the 25th Croatian Regiment based in Zagreb . In May 1914 , Broz won a silver medal at an army fencing competition in Budapest . At the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , he was sent to Ruma , where he was arrested for anti-war propaganda and imprisoned in the Petrovaradin fortress . In January 1915 , he was sent to the Eastern Front in Galicia to fight against Russia . He distinguished himself as a capable soldier , becoming the youngest Sergeant Major in the Austro-Hungarian Army . For his bravery in the face of the enemy , he was recommended for the Silver Bravery Medal but was taken prisoner of war before it could be formally presented . On 25 March 1915 , while in Bukovina , he was seriously wounded and captured by the Russians .
" Near East " remained popular in diplomatic , trade and journalistic circles , but a variation soon developed among the scholars and the men of the cloth and their associates : " the Nearer East , " reverting to the classical and then more scholarly distinction of " nearer " and " farther . " They undoubtedly saw a need to separate the Biblical lands from the terrain of the Ottoman Empire . The Christians saw the country as the land of the Old and New Testaments , where Christianity had developed . The scholars in the field of studies that eventually became Biblical archaeology attempted to define it on the basis of archaeology .
The next European to visit was Arent Schuyler de Peyster , of New York , captain of the armed brigantine or privateer Rebecca , sailing under British colours , which passed through the southern Tuvaluan waters in May 1819 ; de Peyster sighted Nukufetau and Funafuti , which he named Ellice 's Island after an English Politician , Edward Ellice , the Member of Parliament for Coventry and the owner of the Rebecca 's cargo . The name Ellice was applied to all nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay .
The introduction of the guided missile resulted in a significant shift in anti-aircraft strategy . Although Germany had been desperate to introduce anti-aircraft missile systems , none became operational during World War II . Following several years of post-war development , however , these systems began to mature into viable weapons systems . The US started an upgrade of their defences using the Nike Ajax missile , and soon the larger anti-aircraft guns disappeared . The same thing occurred in the USSR after the introduction of their SA-2 Guideline systems .
Public bus services within the city are provided by the national bus operator Bus Éireann . City routes are numbered from 201 through to 219 and connect the city centre to the principal suburbs , colleges , shopping centres and places of interest . Two of these bus routes provide orbital services across the Northern and Southern districts of the city respectively . Buses to the outer suburbs , such as Ballincollig , Glanmire , Midleton and Carrigaline are provided from the city 's bus terminal at Parnell Place in the city centre . Suburban services also include shuttles to Cork Airport , and a park and ride facility in the south suburbs only .
Typical use of the various technologies described above include calling or conferencing on a one-on-one , one-to-many or many-to-many basis for personal , business , educational , deaf Video Relay Service and tele-medical , diagnostic and rehabilitative use or services . New services utilizing videocalling and videoconferencing , such as teachers and psychologists conducting online sessions , personal videocalls to inmates incarcerated in penitentiaries , and videoconferencing to resolve airline engineering issues at maintenance facilities , are being created or evolving on an ongoing basis .
Bodhi ( Pāli and Sanskrit , in devanagari : बॊधि ) is a term applied to the experience of Awakening of arahants . Bodhi literally means " awakening " , but it is more commonly translated into English as " enlightenment " . In Early Buddhism , bodhi carried a meaning synonymous to nirvana , using only some different metaphors to describe the experience , which implies the extinction of raga ( greed , craving ) , [ web 12 ] dosa ( hate , aversion ) [ web 13 ] and moha ( delusion ) . [ web 14 ] In the later school of Mahayana Buddhism , the status of nirvana was downgraded in some scriptures , coming to refer only to the extinction of greed and hate , implying that delusion was still present in one who attained nirvana , and that one needed to attain bodhi to eradicate delusion :
Town Quay is the original public quay , and dates from the 13th century . Today 's Eastern Docks were created in the 1830s by land reclamation of the mud flats between the Itchen & Test estuaries . The Western Docks date from the 1930s when the Southern Railway Company commissioned a major land reclamation and dredging programme . Most of the material used for reclamation came from dredging of Southampton Water , to ensure that the port can continue to handle large ships .
Some systems are capable of multipoint conferencing with no MCU , stand-alone , embedded or otherwise . These use a standards-based H.323 technique known as " decentralized multipoint " , where each station in a multipoint call exchanges video and audio directly with the other stations with no central " manager " or other bottleneck . The advantages of this technique are that the video and audio will generally be of higher quality because they do n't have to be relayed through a central point . Also , users can make ad-hoc multipoint calls without any concern for the availability or control of an MCU . This added convenience and quality comes at the expense of some increased network bandwidth , because every station must transmit to every other station directly .
In order to seek out the Karmapa , the Yongle Emperor dispatched his eunuch Hou Xian and the Buddhist monk Zhi Guang ( d. 1435 ) to Tibet . Traveling to Lhasa either through Qinghai or via the Silk Road to Khotan , Hou Xian and Zhi Guang did not return to Nanjing until 1407 .
Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from " Outside " , and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive . In rural areas , subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive . Though most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline , the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high , because of the terrain and difficult road conditions , which change dramatically , due to varying climate and precipitation changes . The cost of transport can reach as high as 50¢ per pound ( $ 1.10/kg ) or more in some remote areas , during the most difficult times , if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions . The cost of delivering a 1 US gallon ( 3.8 L ) of milk is about $ 3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $ 20,000 or less . Fuel cost per gallon is routinely 20–30¢ higher than the continental United States average , with only Hawaii having higher prices .
New York City has over 28,000 acres ( 110 km2 ) of municipal parkland and 14 miles ( 23 km ) of public beaches . Parks in New York City include Central Park , Prospect Park , Flushing Meadows–Corona Park , Forest Park , and Washington Square Park . The largest municipal park in the city is Pelham Bay Park with 2,700 acres ( 1,093 ha ) .
Meanwhile , in Renaissance Italy , a new period in the history of translation had opened in Florence with the arrival , at the court of Cosimo de ' Medici , of the Byzantine scholar Georgius Gemistus Pletho shortly before the fall of Constantinople to the Turks ( 1453 ) . A Latin translation of Plato 's works was undertaken by Marsilio Ficino . This and Erasmus ' Latin edition of the New Testament led to a new attitude to translation . For the first time , readers demanded rigor of rendering , as philosophical and religious beliefs depended on the exact words of Plato , Aristotle and Jesus .
Richard Phillips Feynman ( /ˈfaɪnmən/ ; May 11 , 1918 – February 15 , 1988 ) was an American theoretical physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics , the theory of quantum electrodynamics , and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium , as well as in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model . For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics , Feynman , jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga , received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 . He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles , which later became known as Feynman diagrams . During his lifetime , Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world . In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time .
Nanjing first became a state capital in 229 AD , when the state of Eastern Wu founded by Sun Quan during the Three Kingdoms period relocated its capital to Jianye ( 建業 ) , the city extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in 211 AD . Although conquered by the Western Jin dynasty in 280 , Nanjing and its neighbouring areas had been well cultivated and developed into one of the commercial , cultural and political centers of China during the rule of East Wu . This city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries .
Demand in Europe for Chinese goods such as silk , tea , and ceramics could only be met if European companies funneled their limited supplies of silver into China . In the late 1700s , the governments of Britain and France were deeply concerned about the imbalance of trade and the drain of silver . To meet the growing Chinese demand for opium , the British East India Company greatly expanded its production in Bengal . Since China 's economy was essentially self-sufficient , the country had little need to import goods or raw materials from the Europeans , so the usual way of payment was through silver . The Daoguang Emperor , concerned both over the outflow of silver and the damage that opium smoking was causing to his subjects , ordered Lin Zexu to end the opium trade . Lin confiscated the stocks of opium without compensation in 1839 , leading Britain to send a military expedition the following year .

Oklahoma State University–Oklahoma City is located in the " Furniture District " on the Westside . Northeast of the city is Langston University , the state 's historically black college ( HBCU ) . Langston also has an urban campus in the eastside section of the city . Southern Nazarene University , which was founded by the Church of the Nazarene , is a university located in suburban Bethany , which is surrounded by the Oklahoma City city limits .
The Paris Region is France 's leading region for economic activity , with a 2012 GDP of €624 billion ( US $ 687 billion ) . In 2011 , its GDP ranked second among the regions of Europe and its per-capita GDP was the 4th highest in Europe . While the Paris region 's population accounted for 18.8 percent of metropolitan France in 2011 , the Paris region 's GDP accounted for 30 percent of metropolitan France 's GDP . In 2015 it hosts the world headquarters of 29 of the 31 Fortune Global 500 companies located in France .
Direct democracy and federalism are hallmarks of the Swiss political system . Swiss citizens are subject to three legal jurisdictions : the commune , canton and federal levels . The 1848 federal constitution defines a system of direct democracy ( sometimes called half-direct or representative direct democracy because it is aided by the more commonplace institutions of a representative democracy ) . The instruments of this system at the federal level , known as civic rights ( Volksrechte , droits civiques ) , include the right to submit a constitutional initiative and a referendum , both of which may overturn parliamentary decisions .
Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing , shortness of breath , chest tightness , and coughing . Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up . During recovery from an attack , it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils . Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air . Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms , usually in response to triggers , whereas others may have marked and persistent symptoms .
All of the highways into Wenchuan , and others throughout the province , were damaged , resulting in delayed arrival of the rescue troops . In Beichuan County , 80 % of the buildings collapsed according to Xinhua News . In the city of Shifang , the collapse of two chemical plants led to leakage of some 80 tons of liquid ammonia , with hundreds of people reported buried . In the city of Dujiangyan , south-east of the epicenter , a whole school collapsed with 900 students buried and fewer than 60 survived . The Juyuan Middle School , where many teenagers were buried , was excavated by civilians and cranes . Dujiangyan is home of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System , an ancient water diversion project which is still in use and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The project 's famous Fish Mouth was cracked but not severely damaged otherwise .
The papacy further refined the practice in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages , holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist . This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy . The laity continued the practices of pilgrimages , veneration of relics , and belief in the power of the Devil . Mystics such as Meister Eckhart ( d. 1327 ) and Thomas à Kempis ( d. 1471 ) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life , which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation . Besides mysticism , belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread , and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the Malleus Maleficarum , the most popular handbook for witch-hunters .
The Neolithic 2 ( PPNB ) began around 8,800 BCE according to the ASPRO chronology in the Levant ( Jericho , Israel ) . As with the PPNA dates , there are two versions from the same laboratories noted above . This system of terminology , however , is not convenient for southeast Anatolia and settlements of the middle Anatolia basin . This era was before the Mesolithic era . [ citation needed ] A settlement of 3,000 inhabitants was found in the outskirts of Amman , Jordan . Considered to be one of the largest prehistoric settlements in the Near East , called 'Ain Ghazal , it was continuously inhabited from approximately 7,250 – 5,000 B .
In the assembly elections held in November 2012 , the Congress secured an absolute majority . The Congress won 36 of the 68 seats while the BJP won only 26 of the 68 seats . Virbhadra Singh was sworn-in as Himachal Pradesh 's Chief Minister for a record sixth term in Shimla on 25 December 2012 . Virbhadra Singh who has held the top office in Himachal five times in the past , was administered the oath of office and secrecy by Governor Urmila Singh at an open ceremony at the historic Ridge Maidan in Shimla .
Plato describes the priestesses of Delphi and Dodona as frenzied women , obsessed by " mania " ( μανία , " frenzy " ) , a Greek word he connected with mantis ( μάντις , " prophet " ) . Frenzied women like Sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the Near East as Mari in the second millennium BC . Although Crete had contacts with Mari from 2000 BC , there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the Minoan and Mycenean ages . It is more probable that this art was introduced later from Anatolia and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to Delphi and dormant in several areas of Greece .
The tram system that now criss-crosses the historic city centre complements walking and biking in it . The centre has been transformed into a pedestrian priority zone that enables and invites walking and biking by making these active modes of transport comfortable , safe and enjoyable . These attributes are accomplished by applying the principle of " filtered permeability " to the existing irregular network of streets . It means that the network adaptations favour active transportation and , selectively , " filter out " the car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre . While certain streets are discontinuous for cars , they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre . In addition , these paths go through public squares and open spaces increasing the enjoyment of the trip . This logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts – the Fused Grid .
Melbourne ( /ˈmɛlbərn/ , AU i/ˈmɛlbən/ ) is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Victoria , and the second most populous city in Australia and Oceania . The name " Melbourne " refers to the area of urban agglomeration ( as well as a census statistical division ) spanning 9,900 km2 ( 3,800 sq mi ) which comprises the broader metropolitan area , as well as being the common name for its city centre . The metropolis is located on the large natural bay of Port Phillip and expands into the hinterlands towards the Dandenong and Macedon mountain ranges , Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley . Melbourne consists of 31 municipalities . It has a population of 4,347,955 as of 2013 , and its inhabitants are called Melburnians .
Around the 6th century , Slavs appeared on Byzantine borders in great numbers . [ page needed ] The Byzantine records note that grass would not regrow in places where the Slavs had marched through , so great were their numbers . After a military movement even the Peloponnese and Asia Minor were reported to have Slavic settlements . This southern movement has traditionally been seen as an invasive expansion . By the end of the 6th century , Slavs had settled the Eastern Alps regions .

In August 2007 Virgil Griffith , a Caltech computation and neural-systems graduate student , created a searchable database that linked changes made by anonymous Wikipedia editors to companies and organizations from which the changes were made . The database cross-referenced logs of Wikipedia edits with publicly available records pertaining to the internet IP addresses edits were made from . Griffith was motivated by the edits from the United States Congress , and wanted to see if others were similarly promoting themselves . The tool was designed to detect conflict of interest edits . Among his findings were that FBI computers were used to edit the FBI article in Wikipedia . Although the edits correlated with known FBI IP addresses , there was no proof that the changes actually came from a member or employee of the FBI , only that someone who had access to their network had edited the FBI article in Wikipedia . Wikipedia spokespersons received Griffith 's " WikiScanner " positively , noting that it helped prevent conflicts of interest from influencing articles as well as increasing transparency and mitigating attempts to remove or distort relevant facts .
Adolf Hitler failed to pay as much attention to bombing the enemy as he did to protection from enemy bombing , although he had promoted the development of a bomber force in the 1930s and understood that it was possible to use bombers for major strategic purposes . He told the OKL in 1939 that ruthless employment of the Luftwaffe against the heart of the British will to resist could and would follow when the moment was right ; however , he quickly developed a lively scepticism toward strategic bombing , confirmed by the results of the Blitz . He frequently complained of the Luftwaffe 's inability to damage industries sufficiently , saying , " The munitions industry can not be interfered with effectively by air raids ... usually the prescribed targets are not hit " .
In DC circuits and pulsed circuits , current and voltage reversal are affected by the damping of the system . Voltage reversal is encountered in RLC circuits that are under-damped . The current and voltage reverse direction , forming a harmonic oscillator between the inductance and capacitance . The current and voltage will tend to oscillate and may reverse direction several times , with each peak being lower than the previous , until the system reaches an equilibrium . This is often referred to as ringing . In comparison , critically damped or over-damped systems usually do not experience a voltage reversal . Reversal is also encountered in AC circuits , where the peak current will be equal in each direction .
By the late 1950s , the motion picture business was again changing . The combination of the studio/theater-chain break-up and the rise of television saw the reduced audience size for cinema productions . The Music Corporation of America ( MCA ) , then predominately a talent agency , had also become a powerful television producer , renting space at Republic Studios for its Revue Productions subsidiary . After a period of complete shutdown , a moribund Universal agreed to sell its 360-acre ( 1.5 km² ) studio lot to MCA in 1958 , for $ 11 million , renamed Revue Studios . MCA owned the studio lot , but not Universal Pictures , yet was increasingly influential on Universal 's product . The studio lot was upgraded and modernized , while MCA clients like Doris Day , Lana Turner , Cary Grant , and director Alfred Hitchcock were signed to Universal Pictures contracts .
Bacterial species differ in the number and arrangement of flagella on their surface ; some have a single flagellum ( monotrichous ) , a flagellum at each end ( amphitrichous ) , clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell ( lophotrichous ) , while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell ( peritrichous ) . The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins , with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly . The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power . This motor drives the motion of the filament , which acts as a propeller .
The Scottish philosopher David Hume ( 1711–1776 ) responded to Berkeley 's criticisms of Locke , as well as other differences between early modern philosophers , and moved empiricism to a new level of skepticism . Hume argued in keeping with the empiricist view that all knowledge derives from sense experience , but he accepted that this has implications not normally acceptable to philosophers . He wrote for example , " Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable . On this view , we must say that it is only probable that all men must die or that the sun will rise to-morrow , because neither of these can be demonstrated . But to conform our language more to common use , we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations , proofs , and probabilities—by ‘proofs’ meaning arguments from experience that leave no room for doubt or opposition . " And ,
Air defence in naval tactics , especially within a carrier group , is often built around a system of concentric layers with the aircraft carrier at the centre . The outer layer will usually be provided by the carrier 's aircraft , specifically its AEW & C aircraft combined with the CAP . If an attacker is able to penetrate this layer , then the next layers would come from the surface-to-air missiles carried by the carrier 's escorts ; the area-defence missiles , such as the RIM-67 Standard , with a range of up to 100 nmi , and the point-defence missiles , like the RIM-162 ESSM , with a range of up to 30 nmi . Finally , virtually every modern warship will be fitted with small-calibre guns , including a CIWS , which is usually a radar-controlled Gatling gun of between 20mm and 30mm calibre capable of firing several thousand rounds per minute .
The dock connector also allowed the iPod to connect to accessories , which often supplement the iPod 's music , video , and photo playback . Apple sells a few accessories , such as the now-discontinued iPod Hi-Fi , but most are manufactured by third parties such as Belkin and Griffin . Some peripherals use their own interface , while others use the iPod 's own screen . Because the dock connector is a proprietary interface , the implementation of the interface requires paying royalties to Apple .
Historically home to the Kumeyaay people , San Diego was the first site visited by Europeans on what is now the West Coast of the United States . Upon landing in San Diego Bay in 1542 , Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claimed the entire area for Spain , forming the basis for the settlement of Alta California 200 years later . The Presidio and Mission San Diego de Alcalá , founded in 1769 , formed the first European settlement in what is now California . In 1821 , San Diego became part of the newly-independent Mexico , which reformed as the First Mexican Republic two years later . In 1850 , it became part of the United States following the Mexican–American War and the admission of California to the union .
Multi-layer printed circuit boards have trace layers inside the board . This is achieved by laminating a stack of materials in a press by applying pressure and heat for a period of time . This results in an inseparable one piece product . For example , a four-layer PCB can be fabricated by starting from a two-sided copper-clad laminate , etch the circuitry on both sides , then laminate to the top and bottom pre-preg and copper foil . It is then drilled , plated , and etched again to get traces on top and bottom layers .
Finance proved a major problem for the Labour Party during this period ; a " cash for peerages " scandal under Blair resulted in the drying up of many major sources of donations . Declining party membership , partially due to the reduction of activists ' influence upon policy-making under the reforms of Neil Kinnock and Blair , also contributed to financial problems . Between January and March 2008 , the Labour Party received just over £3 million in donations and were £17 million in debt ; compared to the Conservatives ' £6 million in donations and £12 million in debt .
During the Nazi occupation of France during World War II , Brazzaville functioned as the symbolic capital of Free France between 1940 and 1943 . The Brazzaville Conference of 1944 heralded a period of major reform in French colonial policy . Congo benefited from the postwar expansion of colonial administrative and infrastructure spending as a result of its central geographic location within AEF and the federal capital at Brazzaville . It also received a local legislature after the adoption of the 1946 constitution that established the Fourth Republic .
In 1578 , Elizabeth I granted a patent to Humphrey Gilbert for discovery and overseas exploration . That year , Gilbert sailed for the West Indies with the intention of engaging in piracy and establishing a colony in North America , but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic . In 1583 he embarked on a second attempt , on this occasion to the island of Newfoundland whose harbour he formally claimed for England , although no settlers were left behind . Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England , and was succeeded by his half-brother , Walter Raleigh , who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584 . Later that year , Raleigh founded the colony of Roanoke on the coast of present-day North Carolina , but lack of supplies caused the colony to fail .
Conversely , most heat-treatable alloys are precipitation hardening alloys , which produce the opposite effects that steel does . When heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly , these alloys become much softer than normal , during the diffusionless transformation , and then harden as they age . The solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time , forming intermetallic phases , which are difficult to discern from the base metal . Unlike steel , in which the solid solution separates to form different crystal phases , precipitation hardening alloys separate to form different phases within the same crystal . These intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous in crystal structure , but tend to behave heterogeneous , becoming hard and somewhat brittle .
Early civilisations in Myanmar included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Burma and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Burma . In the 9th century , the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and , following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s , the Burmese language , culture and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country . The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the Mongol invasions and several warring states emerged . In the 16th century , reunified by the Taungoo Dynasty , the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia . The early 19th century Konbaung Dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well . The British conquered Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century and the country became a British colony . Myanmar became an independent nation in 1948 , initially as a democratic nation and then , following a coup d'état in 1962 , a military dictatorship .
Prior to the 20th century drugs were generally produced by small scale manufacturers with little regulatory control over manufacturing or claims of safety and efficacy . To the extent that such laws did exist , enforcement was lax . In the United States , increased regulation of vaccines and other biological drugs was spurred by tetanus outbreaks and deaths caused by the distribution of contaminated smallpox vaccine and diphtheria antitoxin . The Biologics Control Act of 1902 required that federal government grant premarket approval for every biological drug and for the process and facility producing such drugs . This was followed in 1906 by the Pure Food and Drugs Act , which forbade the interstate distribution of adulterated or misbranded foods and drugs . A drug was considered misbranded if it contained alcohol , morphine , opium , cocaine , or any of several other potentially dangerous or addictive drugs , and if its label failed to indicate the quantity or proportion of such drugs . The government 's attempts to use the law to prosecute manufacturers for making unsupported claims of efficacy were undercut by a Supreme Court ruling restricting the federal government 's enforcement powers to cases of incorrect specification of the drug 's ingredients .
According to John N. Gray , Popper held that " a theory is scientific only in so far as it is falsifiable , and should be given up as soon as it is falsified . " By applying Popper 's account of scientific method , Gray 's Straw Dogs states that this would have " killed the theories of Darwin and Einstein at birth . " When they were first advanced , Gray claims , each of them was " at odds with some available evidence ; only later did evidence become available that gave them crucial support . " Against this , Gray seeks to establish the irrationalist thesis that " the progress of science comes from acting against reason . "
Tibet was once a strong power contemporaneous with Tang China ( 618–907 ) . Until the Tibetan Empire 's collapse in the 9th century , it was the Tang 's major rival in dominating Inner Asia . The Yarlung rulers of Tibet also signed various peace treaties with the Tang , culminating in a treaty in 821 that fixed the borders between Tibet and China .
The exonym Armenia is attested in the Old Persian Behistun Inscription ( 515 BC ) as Armina ( ) . The ancient Greek terms Ἀρμενία ( Armenía ) and Ἀρμένιοι ( Arménioi , " Armenians " ) are first mentioned by Hecataeus of Miletus ( c. 550 BC – c. 476 BC ) . Xenophon , a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions , describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC . He relates that the people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians . According to the histories of both Moses of Chorene and Michael Chamchian , Armenia derives from the name of Aram , a lineal descendant of Hayk .
As aristocrats for centuries , samurai developed their own cultures that influenced Japanese culture as a whole . The culture associated with the samurai such as the tea ceremony , monochrome ink painting , rock gardens and poetry were adopted by warrior patrons throughout the centuries 1200–1600 . These practices were adapted from the Chinese arts . Zen monks introduced them to Japan and they were allowed to flourish due to the interest of powerful warrior elites . Musō Soseki ( 1275–1351 ) was a Zen monk who was advisor to both Emperor Go-Daigo and General Ashikaga Takauji ( 1304–58 ) . Musō , as well as other monks , acted as political and cultural diplomat between Japan and China . Musō was particularly well known for his garden design . Another Ashikaga patron of the arts was Yoshimasa . His cultural advisor , the Zen monk Zeami , introduced tea ceremony to him . Previously , tea had been used primarily for Buddhist monks to stay awake during meditation .
Following a custom she maintained throughout her widowhood , Victoria spent the Christmas of 1900 at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight . Rheumatism in her legs had rendered her lame , and her eyesight was clouded by cataracts . Through early January , she felt " weak and unwell " , and by mid-January she was " drowsy ... dazed , [ and ] confused " . She died on Tuesday , 22 January 1901 , at half past six in the evening , at the age of 81 . Her son and successor King Edward VII , and her eldest grandson , Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany , were at her deathbed . Her favourite pet Pomeranian , Turri , was laid upon her deathbed as a last request .
In Rajasthan , Jodhpur and Kota are two major educational hubs . Kota is known for its quality education in preparation of various competitive exams , coaching for medical and engineering exams while Jodhpur is home to many higher educational institutions like IIT , AIIMS , National Law University , Sardar Patel Police University , National institute of Fashion Technology , MBM Engineering College etc . Kota is popularly referred to as , " coaching capital of India " . Other major educational institutions are Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani , Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur , IIM Udaipur r and LNMIIT . Rajasthan has nine universities and more than 250 colleges , 55,000 primary and 7,400 secondary schools . There are 41 engineering colleges with an annual enrollment of about 11,500 students . Apart from above there 41 Private universities like Amity University Rajasthan , Jaipur , Manipal University Jaipur , OPJS University , Churu , Mody University of Technology and Science Lakshmangarh ( Women 's University , Sikar ) , RNB Global University , Bikaner . The state has 23 polytechnic colleges and 152 Industrial Training Institutes ( ITIs ) that impart vocational training .
As the School grew , more students were allowed to attend provided that they paid their own fees and lived in the town , outside the College 's original buildings . These students became known as Oppidans , from the Latin word oppidum , meaning town . The Houses developed over time as a means of providing residence for the Oppidans in a more congenial manner , and during the 18th and 19th centuries were mostly run by women known as " dames " . They typically contain about fifty boys . Although classes are organised on a School basis , most boys spend a large proportion of their time in their House . Each House has a formal name , mainly used for post and people outside the Eton community . It is generally known by the boys by the initials or surname of the House Master , the teacher who lives in the house and manages the pupils in it .
The staple foods were generally consumed around 11 o'clock , and consisted of bread , lettuce , cheese , fruits , nuts , and cold meat left over from the dinner the night before . [ citation needed ] The Roman poet Horace mentions another Roman favorite , the olive , in reference to his own diet , which he describes as very simple : " As for me , olives , endives , and smooth mallows provide sustenance . " The family ate together , sitting on stools around a table . Fingers were used to eat solid foods and spoons were used for soups . [ citation needed ]
Taira Kiyomori emerged as the real power in Japan following the Minamoto 's destruction , and he would remain in command for the next 20 years . He gave his daughter Tokuko in marriage to the young emperor Takakura , who died at only 19 , leaving their infant son Antoku to succeed to the throne . Kiyomori filled no less than 50 government posts with his relatives , rebuilt the Inland Sea , and encouraged trade with Sung China . He also took aggressive actions to safeguard his power when necessary , including the removal and exile of 45 court officials and the razing of two troublesome temples , Todai-ji and Kofuku-ji .
The Pindus range continues through the central Peloponnese , crosses the islands of Kythera and Antikythera and finds its way into southwestern Aegean , in the island of Crete where it eventually ends . The islands of the Aegean are peaks of underwater mountains that once constituted an extension of the mainland . Pindus is characterized by its high , steep peaks , often dissected by numerous canyons and a variety of other karstic landscapes . The spectacular Vikos Gorge , part of the Vikos-Aoos National Park in the Pindus range , is listed by the Guinness book of World Records as the deepest gorge in the world . Another notable formation are the Meteora rock pillars , atop which have been built medieval Greek Orthodox monasteries .
However , while Whitehead saw religion as beginning in solitariness , he also saw religion as necessarily expanding beyond the individual . In keeping with his process metaphysics in which relations are primary , he wrote that religion necessitates the realization of " the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals . " In other words , the universe is a community which makes itself whole through the relatedness of each individual entity to all the others – meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone , but only in the context of the universal community . Whitehead writes further that each entity " can find no such value till it has merged its individual claim with that of the objective universe . Religion is world-loyalty . The spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself . " In this way the individual and universal/social aspects of religion are mutually dependent .
The success of its football team made Notre Dame a household name . The success of Note Dame reflected rising status of Irish Americans and Catholics in the 1920s . Catholics rallied up around the team and listen to the games on the radio , especially when it knocked off the schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America — Harvard , Yale , Princeton , and Army . Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism . The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924 . Nativism and anti-Catholicism , especially when directed towards immigrants , were cornerstones of the KKK 's rhetoric , and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic Church . The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend . Clashes with the student body started on March 17 , when students , aware of the anti-Catholic animosity , blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia . On May 19 thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern , and only the arrival of college president Fr . Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes . The next day , football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey the college president and refrain from further violence . A few days later the Klavern broke up , but the hostility shown by the students was an omen and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana .
In 1978 , Sewall Wright suggested that human populations that have long inhabited separated parts of the world should , in general , be considered different subspecies by the usual criterion that most individuals of such populations can be allocated correctly by inspection . Wright argued that it does not require a trained anthropologist to classify an array of Englishmen , West Africans , and Chinese with 100 % accuracy by features , skin color , and type of hair despite so much variability within each of these groups that every individual can easily be distinguished from every other . However , it is customary to use the term race rather than subspecies for the major subdivisions of the human species as well as for minor ones .
The quality of a partial vacuum refers to how closely it approaches a perfect vacuum . Other things equal , lower gas pressure means higher-quality vacuum . For example , a typical vacuum cleaner produces enough suction to reduce air pressure by around 20 % . Much higher-quality vacuums are possible . Ultra-high vacuum chambers , common in chemistry , physics , and engineering , operate below one trillionth ( 10−12 ) of atmospheric pressure ( 100 nPa ) , and can reach around 100 particles/cm3 . Outer space is an even higher-quality vacuum , with the equivalent of just a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter on average . According to modern understanding , even if all matter could be removed from a volume , it would still not be " empty " due to vacuum fluctuations , dark energy , transiting gamma rays , cosmic rays , neutrinos , and other phenomena in quantum physics . In the electromagnetism in the 19th century , vacuum was thought to be filled with a medium called aether . In modern particle physics , the vacuum state is considered the ground state of matter .
The U.S. Army black beret ( having been permanently replaced with the patrol cap ) is no longer worn with the new ACU for garrison duty . After years of complaints that it was n't suited well for most work conditions , Army Chief of Staff General Martin Dempsey eliminated it for wear with the ACU in June 2011 . Soldiers still wear berets who are currently in a unit in jump status , whether the wearer is parachute-qualified , or not ( maroon beret ) , Members of the 75th Ranger Regiment and the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade ( tan beret ) , and Special Forces ( rifle green beret ) and may wear it with the Army Service Uniform for non-ceremonial functions . Unit commanders may still direct the wear of patrol caps in these units in training environments or motor pools .
Radiocarbon dated charcoal placed around 50,000 years ago was found in the Drachloch ( Dragon 's Hole ) cave above the village of Vattis in the canton of St. Gallen , proving that the high peaks were visited by prehistoric people . Seven bear skulls from the cave may have been buried by the same prehistoric people . The peaks , however , were mostly ignored except for a few notable examples , and long left to the exclusive attention of the people of the adjoining valleys . The mountain peaks were seen as terrifying , the abode of dragons and demons , to the point that people blindfolded themselves to cross the Alpine passes . The glaciers remained a mystery and many still believed the highest areas to be inhabited by dragons .
Architecture ( Latin architectura , from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων arkhitekton " architect " , from ἀρχι- " chief " and τέκτων " builder " ) is both the process and the product of planning , designing , and constructing buildings and other physical structures . Architectural works , in the material form of buildings , are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art . Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements .
Galicia has a surface area of 29,574 square kilometres ( 11,419 sq mi ) . Its northernmost point , at 43°47′N , is Estaca de Bares ( also the northernmost point of Spain ) ; its southernmost , at 41°49′N , is on the Portuguese border in the Baixa Limia-Serra do Xurés Natural Park . The easternmost longitude is at 6°42′W on the border between the province of Ourense and the Castilian-Leonese province of Zamora ) its westernmost at 9°18′W , reached in two places : the A Nave Cape in Fisterra ( also known as Finisterre ) , and Cape Touriñán , both in the province of A Coruña .
Hanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine . Its original name Honovere may mean " high ( river ) bank " , though this is debated ( cf . das Hohe Ufer ) . Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century due to its position at a natural crossroads . As overland travel was relatively difficult , its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade . It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine , and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains , so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it . Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine , Ruhr and Saar river valleys , their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north , for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia .
American sociology in the 1940s and 1950s was dominated largely by Talcott Parsons , who argued that aspects of society that promoted structural integration were therefore " functional " . This structural functionalism approach was questioned in the 1960s , when sociologists came to see this approach as merely a justification for inequalities present in the status quo . In reaction , conflict theory was developed , which was based in part on the philosophies of Karl Marx . Conflict theorists saw society as an arena in which different groups compete for control over resources . Symbolic interactionism also came to be regarded as central to sociological thinking . Erving Goffman saw social interactions as a stage performance , with individuals preparing " backstage " and attempting to control their audience through impression management . While these theories are currently prominent in sociological thought , other approaches exist , including feminist theory , post-structuralism , rational choice theory , and postmodernism .
Although initially thought to have originated as a manmade variant of an extant canid species ( variously supposed as being the dhole , golden jackal , or gray wolf ) , extensive genetic studies undertaken during the 2010s indicate that dogs diverged from an extinct wolf-like canid in Eurasia 40,000 years ago . Being the oldest domesticated animal , their long association with people has allowed dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior , as well as thrive on a starch-rich diet which would be inadequate for other canid species .
The fighting within the town had become extremely intense , becoming a door to door battle of survival . Despite a never-ending attack of Prussian infantry , the soldiers of the 2nd Division kept to their positions . The people of the town of Wissembourg finally surrendered to the Germans . The French troops who did not surrender retreated westward , leaving behind 1,000 dead and wounded and another 1,000 prisoners and all of their remaining ammunition . The final attack by the Prussian troops also cost c. 1,000 casualties . The German cavalry then failed to pursue the French and lost touch with them . The attackers had an initial superiority of numbers , a broad deployment which made envelopment highly likely but the effectiveness of French Chassepot rifle-fire inflicted costly repulses on infantry attacks , until the French infantry had been extensively bombarded by the Prussian artillery .
On the eve of America 's entry into World War II , CAA began to extend its ATC responsibilities to takeoff and landing operations at airports . This expanded role eventually became permanent after the war . The application of radar to ATC helped controllers in their drive to keep abreast of the postwar boom in commercial air transportation . In 1946 , meanwhile , Congress gave CAA the added task of administering the federal-aid airport program , the first peacetime program of financial assistance aimed exclusively at promoting development of the nation 's civil airports .
The modern spelling , Tennessee , is attributed to James Glen , the governor of South Carolina , who used this spelling in his official correspondence during the 1750s . The spelling was popularized by the publication of Henry Timberlake 's " Draught of the Cherokee Country " in 1765 . In 1788 , North Carolina created " Tennessee County " , the third county to be established in what is now Middle Tennessee . ( Tennessee County was the predecessor to current-day Montgomery County and Robertson County . ) When a constitutional convention met in 1796 to organize a new state out of the Southwest Territory , it adopted " Tennessee " as the name of the state .
The original post-punk movement ended as the bands associated with the movement turned away from its aesthetics , often in favor of more commercial sounds . Many of these groups would continue recording as part of the new pop movement , with entryism becoming a popular concept . In the United States , driven by MTV and modern rock radio stations , a number of post-punk acts had an influence on or became part of the Second British Invasion of " New Music " there . Some shifted to a more commercial new wave sound ( such as Gang of Four ) , while others were fixtures on American college radio and became early examples of alternative rock . Perhaps the most successful band to emerge from post-punk was U2 , who combined elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music .
Later , the 3rd dynasty of Ur under Ur-Nammu and Shulgi , whose power extended as far as southern Assyria , was the last great " Sumerian renaissance " , but already the region was becoming more Semitic than Sumerian , with the rise in power of the Akkadian speaking Semites in Assyria and elsewhere , and the influx of waves of Semitic Martu ( Amorites ) who were to found several competing local powers including Isin , Larsa , Eshnunna and eventually Babylon . The last of these eventually came to dominate the south of Mesopotamia as the Babylonian Empire , just as the Old Assyrian Empire had already done so in the north from the late 21st century BC . The Sumerian language continued as a sacerdotal language taught in schools in Babylonia and Assyria , much as Latin was used in the Medieval period , for as long as cuneiform was utilized .
Persistent heavy rain and landslides in Wenchuan County and the nearby area badly affected rescue efforts . At the start of rescue operations on May 12 , 20 helicopters were deployed for the delivery of food , water , and emergency aid , and also the evacuation of the injured and reconnaissance of quake-stricken areas . By 17:37 CST on May 13 , a total of over 15,600 troops and militia reservists from the Chengdu Military Region had joined the rescue force in the heavily affected areas . A commander reported from Yingxiu Town , Wenchuan , that around 3,000 survivors were found , while the status of the other inhabitants ( around 9,000 ) remained unclear . The 1,300 rescuers reached the epicenter , and 300 pioneer troops reached the seat of Wenchuan at about 23:30 CST . By 12:17 CST , May 14 , 2008 , communication in the seat of Wenchuan was partly revived . On the afternoon of May 14 , 15 Special Operations Troops , along with relief supplies and communications gear , parachuted into inaccessible Mao County , northeast of Wenchuan .
Despite wide use by politicians , judges and academics , the rule of law has been described as " an exceedingly elusive notion " . Among modern legal theorists , one finds that at least two principal conceptions of the rule of law can be identified : a formalist or " thin " definition , and a substantive or " thick " definition ; one occasionally encounters a third " functional " conception . Formalist definitions of the rule of law do not make a judgment about the " justness " of law itself , but define specific procedural attributes that a legal framework must have in order to be in compliance with the rule of law . Substantive conceptions of the rule of law go beyond this and include certain substantive rights that are said to be based on , or derived from , the rule of law .
In April , during the Revolution of 1848 in Paris , he left for London , where he performed at several concerts and at numerous receptions in great houses . This tour was suggested to him by his Scottish pupil Jane Stirling and her elder sister . Stirling also made all the logistical arrangements and provided much of the necessary funding .
During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907 , parties led by Edgeworth David became the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole . Douglas Mawson , who assumed the leadership of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return , went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931 . In addition , Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 – February 1909 : they were the first humans to traverse the Ross Ice Shelf , the first to traverse the Transantarctic Mountains ( via the Beardmore Glacier ) , and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau . An expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram became the first to reach the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911 , using a route from the Bay of Whales and up the Axel Heiberg Glacier . One month later , the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole .
The common practice period is when many of the ideas that make up western classical music took shape , standardized , or were codified . It began with the Baroque era , running from roughly 1600 to the middle of the 18th century . The Classical era followed , ending roughly around 1820 . The Romantic era ran through the 19th century , ending about 1910 .
The patent examiner , Zenas Fisk Wilber , later stated in an affidavit that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to Bell 's lawyer , Marcellus Bailey , with whom he had served in the Civil War . He claimed he showed Gray 's patent caveat to Bailey . Wilber also claimed ( after Bell arrived in Washington D.C. from Boston ) that he showed Gray 's caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him $ 100 . Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms , although in a letter to Gray , Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details . Bell denied in an affidavit that he ever gave Wilber any money .
No archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today′s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far . In antiquity , a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel ( peninsula ) north of Bern , fortified since the 2nd century BC ( late La Tène period ) , thought to be one of the twelve oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar . During the Roman era , there was a Gallo-Roman vicus on the same site . The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor ( " dwelling of Breno " ) . In the Early Middle Ages , there was a settlement in Bümpliz , now a city district of Bern , some 4 km ( 2 mi ) from the medieval city .
There has , however , been interest among railroad operators in returning to DC use at higher voltages than previously used . At the same voltage , DC often has less loss than AC , and for this reason high-voltage direct current is already used on some bulk power transmission lines . DC avoids the electromagnetic radiation inherent with AC , and on a railway this also reduces interference with signalling and communications and mitigates hypothetical EMF risks . DC also avoids the power factor problems of AC . Of particular interest to railroading is that DC can supply constant power with a single ungrounded wire . Constant power with AC requires three-phase transmission with at least two ungrounded wires . Another important consideration is that mains-frequency 3-phase AC must be carefully planned to avoid unbalanced phase loads . Parts of the system are supplied from different phases on the assumption that the total loads of the 3 phases will even out . At the phase break points between regions supplied from different phases , long insulated supply breaks are required to avoid them being shorted by rolling stock using more than one pantograph at a time . A few railroads have tried 3-phase but its substantial complexity has made single-phase standard practice despite the interruption in power flow that occurs twice every cycle . An experimental 6 kV DC railway was built in the Soviet Union .
In addition to the use of sound for communication , a wide range of insects have evolved chemical means for communication . These chemicals , termed semiochemicals , are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract , repel and provide other kinds of information . Pheromones , a type of semiochemical , are used for attracting mates of the opposite sex , for aggregating conspecific individuals of both sexes , for deterring other individuals from approaching , to mark a trail , and to trigger aggression in nearby individuals . Allomonea benefit their producer by the effect they have upon the receiver . Kairomones benefit their receiver instead of their producer . Synomones benefit the producer and the receiver . While some chemicals are targeted at individuals of the same species , others are used for communication across species . The use of scents is especially well known to have developed in social insects . :96–105
Cold or oxygen-rich atmospheres can sustain life at pressures much lower than atmospheric , as long as the density of oxygen is similar to that of standard sea-level atmosphere . The colder air temperatures found at altitudes of up to 3 km generally compensate for the lower pressures there . Above this altitude , oxygen enrichment is necessary to prevent altitude sickness in humans that did not undergo prior acclimatization , and spacesuits are necessary to prevent ebullism above 19 km . Most spacesuits use only 20 kPa ( 150 Torr ) of pure oxygen . This pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism , but decompression sickness and gas embolisms can still occur if decompression rates are not managed .
The most common staple crops consumed during Han were wheat , barley , foxtail millet , proso millet , rice , and beans . Commonly eaten fruits and vegetables included chestnuts , pears , plums , peaches , melons , apricots , strawberries , red bayberries , jujubes , calabash , bamboo shoots , mustard plant and taro . Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens , Mandarin ducks , geese , cows , sheep , pigs , camels and dogs ( various types were bred specifically for food , while most were used as pets ) . Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes . Commonly hunted game , such as owl , pheasant , magpie , sika deer , and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed . Seasonings included sugar , honey , salt and soy sauce . Beer and wine were regularly consumed .
A monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early Ming dynasty is the Yangshan Quarry ( located some 15–20 km ( 9–12 mi ) east of the walled city and Ming Xiaoling mausoleum ) , where a gigantic stele , cut on the orders of the Yongle Emperor , lies abandoned , just as it was left 600 years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it .
What drove circadian rhythms to evolve has been an enigmatic question . Previous hypotheses emphasized that photosensitive proteins and circadian rhythms may have originated together in the earliest cells , with the purpose of protecting replicating DNA from high levels of damaging ultraviolet radiation during the daytime . As a result , replication was relegated to the dark . However , evidence for this is lacking , since the simplest organisms with a circadian rhythm , the cyanobacteria , do the opposite of this - they divide more in the daytime . Recent studies instead highlight the importance of co-evolution of redox proteins with circadian oscillators in all three kingdoms of life following the Great Oxidation Event approximately 2.3 billion years ago . The current view is that circadian changes in environmental oxygen levels and the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in the presence of daylight are likely to have driven a need to evolve circadian rhythms to preempt , and therefore counteract , damaging redox reactions on a daily basis .
Videoconferencing provides students with the opportunity to learn by participating in two-way communication forums . Furthermore , teachers and lecturers worldwide can be brought to remote or otherwise isolated educational facilities . Students from diverse communities and backgrounds can come together to learn about one another , although language barriers will continue to persist . Such students are able to explore , communicate , analyze and share information and ideas with one another . Through videoconferencing , students can visit other parts of the world to speak with their peers , and visit museums and educational facilities . Such virtual field trips can provide enriched learning opportunities to students , especially those in geographically isolated locations , and to the economically disadvantaged . Small schools can use these technologies to pool resources and provide courses , such as in foreign languages , which could not otherwise be offered .
Bermuda was discovered in 1503 by Spanish explorer Juan de Bermúdez . It is mentioned in Legatio Babylonica , published in 1511 by historian Pedro Mártir de Anglería , and was also included on Spanish charts of that year . Both Spanish and Portuguese ships used the islands as a replenishment spot to take on fresh meat and water . Legends arose of spirits and devils , now thought to have stemmed from the calls of raucous birds ( most likely the Bermuda petrel , or Cahow ) and the loud noise heard at night from wild hogs . Combined with the frequent storm-wracked conditions and the dangerous reefs , the archipelago became known as the Isle of Devils . Neither Spain nor Portugal tried to settle it .
Gaddafi organized demonstrations and distributed posters criticizing the monarchy . In October 1961 , he led a demonstration protesting Syria 's secession from the United Arab Republic . During this they broke windows of a local hotel accused of serving alcohol . Catching the authorities ' attention , they expelled his family from Sabha . Gaddafi moved to Misrata , there attending Misrata Secondary School . Maintaining his interest in Arab nationalist activism , he refused to join any of the banned political parties active in the city – including the Arab Nationalist Movement , the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party , and the Muslim Brotherhood – claiming he rejected factionalism . He read voraciously on the subjects of Nasser and the French Revolution of 1789 , as well as the works of Syrian political theorist Michel Aflaq and biographies of Abraham Lincoln , Sun Yat-sen , and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk .
When Russia invaded the Turkish Balkans in 1853 , fears of Russian dominance in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the Crimean Peninsula to destroy Russian naval capabilities . The ensuing Crimean War ( 1854–56 ) , which involved new techniques of modern warfare , and was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica , was a resounding defeat for Russia . The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades , with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia , Kazakhstan , and Turkmenistan . For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable , but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente . The destruction of the Russian Navy by the Japanese at the Battle of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 also limited its threat to the British .
In June 1970 , Nasser accepted the US-sponsored Rogers Plan , which called for an end to hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory , but it was rejected by Israel , the PLO , and most Arab states except Jordan . Nasser had initially rejected the plan , but conceded under pressure from the Soviet Union , which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US . He also determined that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical step toward the strategic goal of recapturing the Suez Canal . Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel . In dozens of speeches and statements , Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender . Following Nasser 's acceptance , Israel agreed to a ceasefire and Nasser used the lull in fighting to move SAM missiles towards the canal zone .
On 18 September , Stalin dispatched General H. M. Zakharov to Korea to advise Kim Il-sung to halt his offensive around the Pusan perimeter and to redeploy his forces to defend Seoul . Chinese commanders were not briefed on North Korean troop numbers or operational plans . As the overall commander of Chinese forces , Zhou Enlai suggested that the North Koreans should attempt to eliminate the enemy forces at Inchon only if they had reserves of at least 100,000 men ; otherwise , he advised the North Koreans to withdraw their forces north .
All Latin characters required by Pe̍h-ōe-jī can be represented using Unicode ( or the corresponding ISO/IEC 10646 : Universal Character Set ) , using precomposed or combining ( diacritics ) characters . Prior to June 2004 , the vowel akin to but more open than o , written with a dot above right , was not encoded . The usual workaround was to use the ( stand-alone ; spacing ) character Interpunct ( U+00B7 , · ) or less commonly the combining character dot above ( U+0307 ) . As these are far from ideal , since 1997 proposals have been submitted to the ISO/IEC working group in charge of ISO/IEC 10646—namely , ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2—to encode a new combining character dot above right . This is now officially assigned to U+0358 ( see documents N1593 , N2507 , N2628 , N2699 , and N2713 ) . Font support is expected to follow .
On July 26 , Truman mandated the end of hiring and employment discrimination in the federal government , reaffirming FDR 's order of 1941.:40 He issued two executive orders on July 26 , 1948 : Executive Order 9980 and Executive Order 9981 . Executive Order 9980 , named Regulations Governing for Employment Practices within the Federal Establishment , instituted fair employment practices in the civilian agencies of the federal government . The order created the position of Fair Employment Officer . The order " established in the Civil Service Commission a Fair Employment Board of not less than seven persons . " Executive Order 9981 , named Establishing the President 's Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services , called for the integration of the Armed Forces and the creation of the National Military Establishment to carry out the executive order .
Article 10 of the Berne Convention mandates that national laws provide for limitations to copyright , so that copyright protection does not extend to certain kinds of uses that fall under what the treaty calls " fair practice , " including but not limited to minimal quotations used in journalism and education . The laws implementing these limitations and exceptions for uses that would otherwise be infringing broadly fall into the categories of either fair use or fair dealing . In common law systems , these fair practice statutes typically enshrine principles underlying many earlier judicial precedents , and are considered essential to freedom of speech .
Antarctica , on average , is the coldest , driest , and windiest continent , and has the highest average elevation of all the continents . Antarctica is considered a desert , with annual precipitation of only 200 mm ( 8 in ) along the coast and far less inland . The temperature in Antarctica has reached −89.2 °C ( −128.6 °F ) , though the average for the third quarter ( the coldest part of the year ) is −63 °C ( −81 °F ) . There are no permanent human residents , but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent . Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae , bacteria , fungi , plants , protista , and certain animals , such as mites , nematodes , penguins , seals and tardigrades . Vegetation , where it occurs , is tundra .
Arthur M. Diamond argues Hayek 's problems arise when he goes beyond claims that can be evaluated within economic science . Diamond argued that : “The human mind , Hayek says , is not just limited in its ability to synthesize a vast array of concrete facts , it is also limited in its ability to give a deductively sound ground to ethics . Here is where the tension develops , for he also wants to give a reasoned moral defense of the free market . He is an intellectual skeptic who wants to give political philosophy a secure intellectual foundation . It is thus not too surprising that what results is confused and contradictory.”
In June 1973 , Gaddafi created a political ideology as a basis for the Popular Revolution . Third International Theory considered the U.S. and the Soviet Union as imperialist , thus rejected Western capitalism as well as Eastern bloc communism 's atheism . In this respect it was similar to the Three Worlds Theory developed by China 's political leader Mao Zedong . As part of this theory , Gaddafi praised nationalism as a progressive force and advocated the creation of a pan-Arab state which would lead the Islamic and Third Worlds against imperialism .

Bill DeRonde replaced Warwick as a director of the audition episodes , while Louis J. Horvitz replaced Gregg Gelfand as a director of the show .
Orthodox Judaism holds that on Mount Sinai , the Written Law was transmitted along with an Oral Law . The words of the Torah ( Pentateuch ) were spoken to Moses by God ; the laws contained in this Written Torah , the " Mitzvot " , were given along with detailed explanations in the oral tradition as to how to apply and interpret them . Furthermore , the Oral law includes principles designed to create new rules . The Oral law is held to be transmitted with an extremely high degree of accuracy . Jewish theologians , who choose to emphasize the more evolutionary nature of the Halacha point to a famous story in the Talmud , where Moses is miraculously transported to the House of Study of Rabbi Akiva and is clearly unable to follow the ensuing discussion .
Sandra Laing is a South African woman who was classified as Coloured by authorities during the apartheid era , due to her skin colour and hair texture , although her parents could prove at least three generations of European ancestors . At age 10 , she was expelled from her all-white school . The officials ' decisions based on her anomalous appearance disrupted her family and adult life . She was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film Skin , which won numerous awards .
Popular music in Cyprus is generally influenced by the Greek Laïka scene ; artists who play in this genre include international platinum star Anna Vissi , Evridiki , and Sarbel . Hip Hop , R & B and reggae have been supported by the emergence of Cypriot rap and the urban music scene at Ayia Napa . Cypriot rock music and Éntekhno rock is often associated with artists such as Michalis Hatzigiannis and Alkinoos Ioannidis . Metal also has a small following in Cyprus represented by bands such as Armageddon ( rev.16:16 ) , Blynd , Winter 's Verge and Quadraphonic .
Elizabeth and Philip were married on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey . They received 2500 wedding gifts from around the world . Because Britain had not yet completely recovered from the devastation of the war , Elizabeth required ration coupons to buy the material for her gown , which was designed by Norman Hartnell . In post-war Britain , it was not acceptable for the Duke of Edinburgh 's German relations , including his three surviving sisters , to be invited to the wedding . The Duke of Windsor , formerly King Edward VIII , was not invited either .
At her Silver Jubilee in 1977 , the crowds and celebrations were genuinely enthusiastic , but in the 1980s , public criticism of the royal family increased , as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth 's children came under media scrutiny . Elizabeth 's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s . Under pressure from public opinion , she began to pay income tax for the first time , and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public . Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana , Princess of Wales , though Elizabeth 's personal popularity and support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana 's death .
There are three main chemical pulping processes : the sulfite process dates back to the 1840s and it was the dominant method extent before the second world war . The kraft process , invented in the 1870s and first used in the 1890s , is now the most commonly practiced strategy , one of its advantages is the chemical reaction with lignin , that produces heat , which can be used to run a generator . Most pulping operations using the kraft process are net contributors to the electricity grid or use the electricity to run an adjacent paper mill . Another advantage is that this process recovers and reuses all inorganic chemical reagents . Soda pulping is another specialty process used to pulp straws , bagasse and hardwoods with high silicate content .
After boiling , the hopped wort is now cooled , ready for the yeast . In some breweries , the hopped wort may pass through a hopback , which is a small vat filled with hops , to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter ; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter , where the yeast is added . During fermentation , the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer . In addition to producing ethanol , fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation . Once fermentation is complete , the yeast also settles , leaving the beer clear .
The creation of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 was through the unification of the western states ( which were previously under American , British , and French administration ) created in the aftermath of World War II . Initially , in 1949 , the states of the Federal Republic were Baden , Bavaria ( in German : Bayern ) , Bremen , Hamburg , Hesse ( Hessen ) , Lower Saxony ( Niedersachsen ) , North Rhine Westphalia ( Nordrhein-Westfalen ) , Rhineland-Palatinate ( Rheinland-Pfalz ) , Schleswig-Holstein , Württemberg-Baden , and Württemberg-Hohenzollern . West Berlin , while officially not part of the Federal Republic , was largely integrated and considered as a de facto state .
The first Archivist , R.D.W . Connor , began serving in 1934 , when the National Archives was established by Congress . As a result of a first Hoover Commission recommendation , in 1949 the National Archives was placed within the newly formed General Services Administration ( GSA ) . The Archivist served as a subordinate official to the GSA Administrator until the National Archives and Records Administration became an independent agency on April 1 , 1985 .
Welsh sides that play in English leagues are eligible , although since the creation of the League of Wales there are only six clubs remaining : Cardiff City ( the only non-English team to win the tournament , in 1927 ) , Swansea City , Newport County , Wrexham , Merthyr Town and Colwyn Bay . In the early years other teams from Wales , Ireland and Scotland also took part in the competition , with Glasgow side Queen 's Park losing the final to Blackburn Rovers in 1884 and 1885 before being barred from entering by the Scottish Football Association . In the 2013–14 season the first Channel Island club entered the competition when Guernsey F.C . competed for the first time .
Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors , sensory capabilities , and physical attributes . Modern dog breeds show more variation in size , appearance , and behavior than any other domestic animal . Dogs are predators and scavengers , and like many other predatory mammals , the dog has powerful muscles , fused wrist bones , a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance , and teeth for catching and tearing .
Karl Popper was born in Vienna ( then in Austria-Hungary ) in 1902 , to upper middle-class parents . All of Karl Popper 's grandparents were Jewish , but the Popper family converted to Lutheranism before Karl was born , and so he received Lutheran baptism . They understood this as part of their cultural assimilation , not as an expression of devout belief . Karl 's father Simon Siegmund Carl Popper was a lawyer from Bohemia and a doctor of law at the Vienna University , and mother Jenny Schiff was of Silesian and Hungarian descent . After establishing themselves in Vienna , the Poppers made a rapid social climb in Viennese society : Simon Siegmund Carl became a partner in the law firm of Vienna 's liberal Burgomaster Herr Grübl and , after Grübl 's death in 1898 , Simon took over the business . ( Malachi Hacohen records that Herr Grübl 's first name was Raimund , after which Karl received his middle name . Popper himself , in his autobiography , erroneously recalls that Herr Grübl 's first name was Carl . ) His father was a bibliophile who had 12,000–14,000 volumes in his personal library . Popper inherited both the library and the disposition from him .
Windows 8 also incorporates improved support for mobile broadband ; the operating system can now detect the insertion of a SIM card and automatically configure connection settings ( including APNs and carrier branding ) , and reduce its internet usage in order to conserve bandwidth on metered networks . Windows 8 also adds an integrated airplane mode setting to globally disable all wireless connectivity as well . Carriers can also offer account management systems through Windows Store apps , which can be automatically installed as a part of the connection process and offer usage statistics on their respective tile .
The Age of Enlightenment was preceded by and closely associated with the scientific revolution . Earlier philosophers whose work influenced the Enlightenment included Francis Bacon , Descartes , Locke , and Spinoza . The major figures of the Enlightenment included Cesare Beccaria , Voltaire , Denis Diderot , Jean-Jacques Rousseau , David Hume , Adam Smith , and Immanuel Kant . Some European rulers , including Catherine II of Russia , Joseph II of Austria and Frederick I of Prussia , tried to apply Enlightenment thought on religious and political tolerance , which became known as enlightened absolutism . The Americans Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson came to Europe during the period and contributed actively to the scientific and political debate , and the ideals of the Enlightenment were incorporated into the United States Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States .
This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets . New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found . Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon , and probably Mars , by impacts . These specimens , particularly ALH84001 discovered by ANSMET , are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars . Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation , the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies . The elapsed time since fall , or terrestrial residence age , of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets .
On June 28 , 1776 , General Sir Henry Clinton along with 2,000 men and a naval squadron tried to seize Charles Towne , hoping for a simultaneous Loyalist uprising in South Carolina . When the fleet fired cannonballs , they failed to penetrate Fort Sullivan 's unfinished , yet thick , palmetto-log walls . No local Loyalists attacked the town from the mainland side , as the British had hoped they would do . Col. Moultrie 's men returned fire and inflicted heavy damage on several of the British ships . The British were forced to withdraw their forces , and the Americans renamed the defensive installation as Fort Moultrie in honor of its commander .
Boston has been called the " Athens of America " for its literary culture , earning a reputation as " the intellectual capital of the United States . " In the nineteenth century , Ralph Waldo Emerson , Henry David Thoreau , Nathaniel Hawthorne , Margaret Fuller , James Russell Lowell , and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote in Boston . Some consider the Old Corner Bookstore , where these writers met and where The Atlantic Monthly was first published , to be " cradle of American literature . In 1852 , the Boston Public Library was founded as the first free library in the United States . Boston 's literary culture continues today thanks to the city 's many universities and the Boston Book Festival .
The Trans-Alaska Pipeline can transport and pump up to 2.1 million barrels ( 330,000 m3 ) of crude oil per day , more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States . Additionally , substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska 's bituminous , sub-bituminous , and lignite coal basins . The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet ( 2,420 km3 ) of undiscovered , technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope . Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers . Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well .
After its return in 2010 , the AFL had its national television deal with the NFL Network for a weekly Friday night game . All AFL games not on the NFL Network could be seen for free online , provided by Ustream .
Local chemist William Cookworthy established his somewhat short-lived Plymouth Porcelain venture in 1768 to exploit the recently discovered deposits of local China Clay - an industry which continues to make up a portion of the city income . As an associate and host of engineer John Smeaton he was indirectly involved with the development of the Eddystone Lighthouse .
Henry VIII assumed direct royal control in 1539 and granted the abbey the status of a cathedral by charter in 1540 , simultaneously issuing letters patent establishing the Diocese of Westminster . By granting the abbey cathedral status Henry VIII gained an excuse to spare it from the destruction or dissolution which he inflicted on most English abbeys during this period .

The current Chief of the Defence Staff , the professional head of the British Armed Forces , is General Sir Nicholas Houghton , late Green Howards . He is supported by the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff , by the professional heads of the three services of HM Armed Forces and by the Commander of Joint Forces Command .
The crusaders consolidated their conquests into crusader states . During the 12th and 13th centuries , there were a series of conflicts between those states and the surrounding Islamic states . Appeals from those states to the papacy led to further crusades , such as the Third Crusade , called to try to regain Jerusalem , which had been captured by Saladin ( d. 1193 ) in 1187 . [ Z ] In 1203 , the Fourth Crusade was diverted from the Holy Land to Constantinople , and captured the city in 1204 , setting up a Latin Empire of Constantinople and greatly weakening the Byzantine Empire . The Byzantines recaptured the city in 1261 , but never regained their former strength . By 1291 all the crusader states had been captured or forced from the mainland , although a titular Kingdom of Jerusalem survived on the island of Cyprus for several years afterwards .
As of 2013 the City of Paris had 1,570 hotels with 70,034 rooms , of which 55 were rated five-star , mostly belonging to international chains and mostly located close to the centre and the Champs-Élysées . Paris has long been famous for its grand hotels . The Hotel Meurice , opened for British travellers in 1817 , was one of the first luxury hotels in Paris . The arrival of the railroads and the Paris Exposition of 1855 brought the first flood of tourists and the first modern grand hotels ; the Hôtel du Louvre ( now an antiques marketplace ) in 1855 ; the Grand Hotel ( now the Intercontinental LeGrand ) in 1862 ; and the Hôtel Continental in 1878 . The Hôtel Ritz on Place Vendôme opened in 1898 , followed by the Hôtel Crillon in an 18th-century building on the Place de la Concorde in 1909 ; the Hotel Bristol on rue de Fabourg Saint-Honoré in 1925 ; and the Hotel George V in 1928 .
The AEA 's work progressed to heavier-than-air machines , applying their knowledge of kites to gliders . Moving to Hammondsport , the group then designed and built the Red Wing , framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small air-cooled engine . On March 12 , 1908 , over Keuka Lake , the biplane lifted off on the first public flight in North America . [ N 24 ] [ N 25 ] The innovations that were incorporated into this design included a cockpit enclosure and tail rudder ( later variations on the original design would add ailerons as a means of control ) . One of the AEA 's inventions , a practical wingtip form of the aileron , was to become a standard component on all aircraft . [ N 26 ] The White Wing and June Bug were to follow and by the end of 1908 , over 150 flights without mishap had been accomplished . However , the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a $ 15,000 grant from Mrs. Bell allowed it to continue with experiments . Lt. Selfridge had also become the first person killed in a powered heavier-than-air flight in a crash of the Wright Flyer at Fort Myer , Virginia , on September 17 , 1908 .
The etymology of the name is uncertain . The spelling Ἀπόλλων ( pronounced [ a.pól.lɔːn ] in Classical Attic ) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era , but the Doric form Apellon ( Ἀπέλλων ) , is more archaic , derived from an earlier *Ἀπέλjων . It probably is a cognate to the Doric month Apellaios ( Ἀπελλαῖος ) , and the offerings apellaia ( ἀπελλαῖα ) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival apellai ( ἀπέλλαι ) . According to some scholars the words are derived from the Doric word apella ( ἀπέλλα ) , which originally meant " wall , " " fence for animals " and later " assembly within the limits of the square . " Apella ( Ἀπέλλα ) is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta , corresponding to the ecclesia ( ἐκκλησία ) . R. S. P. Beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun apellai and suggested a Pre-Greek proto-form *Apalyun .
Competition for employees with the public and private sector is another problem that Nonprofit organizations will inevitably face , particularly for management positions . There are reports of major talent shortages in the nonprofit sector today regarding newly graduated workers , and NPOs have for too long relegated hiring to a secondary priority , which could be why they find themselves in the position many do . While many established NPO 's are well-funded and comparative to their public sector competetitors , many more are independent and must be creative with which incentives they use to attract and maintain vibrant personalities . The initial interest for many is the wage and benefits package , though many who have been questioned after leaving an NPO have reported that it was stressful work environments and implacable work that drove them away .
Federal law and treaties , so long as they are in accordance with the Constitution , preempt conflicting state and territorial laws in the 50 U.S. states and in the territories . However , the scope of federal preemption is limited because the scope of federal power is not universal . In the dual-sovereign system of American federalism ( actually tripartite because of the presence of Indian reservations ) , states are the plenary sovereigns , each with their own constitution , while the federal sovereign possesses only the limited supreme authority enumerated in the Constitution . Indeed , states may grant their citizens broader rights than the federal Constitution as long as they do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights . Thus , most U.S. law ( especially the actual " living law " of contract , tort , property , criminal , and family law experienced by the majority of citizens on a day-to-day basis ) consists primarily of state law , which can and does vary greatly from one state to the next .
Wary of protests , the Indian authorities have decided to shorten the route of the relay in New Delhi , and have given it the security normally associated with Republic Day celebrations , which are considered terrorist targets . Chinese intelligence 's expectations of points on the relay route that would be particularly 'vulnerable ' to protesters were presented to the Indian ambassador to Beijing , Nirupama Sen . The Indian media responded angrily to the news that the ambassador , a distinguished lady diplomat , was summoned to the Foreign Ministry at 2 am local time ; the news was later denied by anonymous sources in Delhi . The Indian media reported that India 's Commerce Minister , Kamal Nath , cancelled an official trip to Beijing in protest , though both Nath and Chinese sources have denied it .
The role and functions of the CIA are roughly equivalent to those of the United Kingdom 's Secret Intelligence Service ( the SIS or MI6 ) , the Australian Secret Intelligence Service ( ASIS ) , the Egyptian General Intelligence Service , the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service ( Sluzhba Vneshney Razvedki ) ( SVR ) , the Indian Research and Analysis Wing ( RAW ) , the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , the French foreign intelligence service Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure ( DGSE ) and Israel 's Mossad . While the preceding agencies both collect and analyze information , some like the U.S. State Department 's Bureau of Intelligence and Research are purely analytical agencies . [ citation needed ]
The University of Kansas Medical Center features three schools : the School of Medicine , School of Nursing , and School of Health Professions . Furthermore , each of the three schools has its own programs of graduate study . As of the Fall 2013 semester , there were 3,349 students enrolled at KU Med . The Medical Center also offers four year instruction at the Wichita campus , and features a medical school campus in Salina , Kansas that is devoted to rural health care .
The CIA had different demands placed on it by the different bodies overseeing it . Truman wanted a centralized group to organize the information that reached him , the Department of Defense wanted military intelligence and covert action , and the State Department wanted to create global political change favorable to the US . Thus the two areas of responsibility for the CIA were covert action and covert intelligence . One of the main targets for intelligence gathering was the Soviet Union , which had also been a priority of the CIA 's predecessors .
Matisse was also one of the first 20th-century artists to make color the central element of the painting , chosen to evoke emotions . " A certain blue penetrates your soul " , he wrote . " A certain red affects your blood pressure . " He also was familiar with the way that complementary colors , such as red and green , strengthened each other when they were placed next to each other . He wrote , " My choice of colors is not based on scientific theory ; it is based on observation , upon feelings , upon the real nature of each experience ... I just try to find a color which corresponds to my feelings . "
Post-punk was an eclectic genre which resulted in a wide variety of musical innovations and helped merge white and black musical styles . Out of the post-punk milieu came the beginnings of various subsequent genres , including new wave , dance-rock , New Pop , industrial music , synthpop , post-hardcore , neo-psychedelia alternative rock and house music . Bands such as Joy Division , Siouxsie and the Banshees , Bauhaus and the Cure played in a darker , more morose style of post-punk that lead to the development of the gothic rock genre .

" So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness : and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast , full of names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns . " And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls , having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication : " And upon her forehead was a name written a mystery : Babylon the Great , the Mother of Harlots and of all the abominations of the earth : And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus .
High-speed USB 2.0 hubs contain devices called transaction translators that convert between high-speed USB 2.0 buses and full and low speed buses . When a high-speed USB 2.0 hub is plugged into a high-speed USB host or hub , it operates in high-speed mode . The USB hub then uses either one transaction translator per hub to create a full/low-speed bus routed to all full and low speed devices on the hub , or uses one transaction translator per port to create an isolated full/low-speed bus per port on the hub .
Malaysia-based Yazhou Zhoukan conducted an interview with former researcher at the China Seismological Bureau Geng Qingguo ( 耿庆国 ) , in which Geng claimed that a confidential written report was sent to the State Seismological Bureau on April 30 , 2008 , warning about the possible occurrence of a significant earthquake in Ngawa Prefecture region of Sichuan around May 8 , with a range of 10 days before or after the quake . Geng , while acknowledging that earthquake prediction was broadly considered problematic by the scientific community , believed that " the bigger the earthquake , the easier it is to predict . " Geng had long attempted to establish a correlation between the occurrence of droughts and earthquakes ; Premier Zhou Enlai reportedly took an interest in Geng 's work . Geng 's drought-earthquake correlation theory was first released in 1972 , and said to have successfully predicted the 1975 Haicheng and 1976 Tangshan earthquakes . The same Yazhou Zhoukan article pointed out the inherent difficulties associated with predicting earthquakes . In response , an official with the Seismological Bureau stated that " earthquake prediction is widely acknowledged around the world to be difficult from a scientific standpoint . " The official also denied that the Seismological Bureau had received reports predicting the earthquake .

The most well-known disease that affects the immune system itself is AIDS , an immunodeficiency characterized by the suppression of CD4+ ( " helper " ) T cells , dendritic cells and macrophages by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) .
Every major company selling the antipsychotics — Bristol-Myers Squibb , Eli Lilly , Pfizer , AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson — has either settled recent government cases , under the False Claims Act , for hundreds of millions of dollars or is currently under investigation for possible health care fraud . Following charges of illegal marketing , two of the settlements set records last year for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations . One involved Eli Lilly 's antipsychotic Zyprexa , and the other involved Bextra . In the Bextra case , the government also charged Pfizer with illegally marketing another antipsychotic , Geodon ; Pfizer settled that part of the claim for $ 301 million , without admitting any wrongdoing .
These reforms were based heavily on French models , as indicated by the adoption of a three-tiered court system . Referred to as Nizamiye , this system was extended to the local magistrate level with the final promulgation of the Mecelle , a civil code that regulated marriage , divorce , alimony , will , and other matters of personal status . In an attempt to clarify the division of judicial competences , an administrative council laid down that religious matters were to be handled by religious courts , and statute matters were to be handled by the Nizamiye courts .
The Human Development Index has been criticized on a number of grounds including alleged ideological biases towards egalitarianism and so-called " Western models of development " , failure to include any ecological considerations , lack of consideration of technological development or contributions to the human civilization , focusing exclusively on national performance and ranking , lack of attention to development from a global perspective , measurement error of the underlying statistics , and on the UNDP 's changes in formula which can lead to severe misclassification in the categorisation of 'low ' , 'medium ' , 'high ' or 'very high ' human development countries .
Kerry is a Roman Catholic , and is said to carry a religious rosary , a prayer book , and a St. Christopher medal ( the patron saint of travelers ) when he campaigned . While Kerry is personally against abortion , he supports a woman 's legal right to have one . Discussing his faith , Kerry said , " I thought of being a priest . I was very religious while at school in Switzerland . I was an altar boy and prayed all the time . I was very centered around the Mass and the church . " He also said that the Letters of Paul ( Apostle Paul ) moved him the most , stating that they taught him to " not feel sorry for myself . "
A reference simulation software implementation , written in the C language and later known as ISO 11172-5 , was developed ( in 1991–1996 ) by the members of the ISO MPEG Audio committee in order to produce bit compliant MPEG Audio files ( Layer 1 , Layer 2 , Layer 3 ) . It was approved as a committee draft of ISO/IEC technical report in March 1994 and printed as document CD 11172-5 in April 1994 . It was approved as a draft technical report ( DTR/DIS ) in November 1994 , finalized in 1996 and published as international standard ISO/IEC TR 11172-5:1998 in 1998 . The reference software in C language was later published as a freely available ISO standard . Working in non-real time on a number of operating systems , it was able to demonstrate the first real time hardware decoding ( DSP based ) of compressed audio . Some other real time implementation of MPEG Audio encoders were available for the purpose of digital broadcasting ( radio DAB , television DVB ) towards consumer receivers and set top boxes .
On 25 June 1950 , the United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the North Korean invasion of the Republic of Korea , with UN Security Council Resolution 82 . The Soviet Union , a veto-wielding power , had boycotted the Council meetings since January 1950 , protesting that the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) , not the People 's Republic of China , held a permanent seat in the UN Security Council . After debating the matter , the Security Council , on 27 June 1950 , published Resolution 83 recommending member states provide military assistance to the Republic of Korea . On 27 June President Truman ordered U.S. air and sea forces to help the South Korean regime . On 4 July the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister accused the United States of starting armed intervention on behalf of South Korea .
According to Genius , the James Gleick-authored biography , Feynman tried LSD during his professorship at Caltech . Somewhat embarrassed by his actions , he largely sidestepped the issue when dictating his anecdotes ; he mentions it in passing in the " O Americano , Outra Vez " section , while the " Altered States " chapter in Surely You 're Joking , Mr. Feynman ! describes only marijuana and ketamine experiences at John Lilly 's famed sensory deprivation tanks , as a way of studying consciousness . Feynman gave up alcohol when he began to show vague , early signs of alcoholism , as he did not want to do anything that could damage his brain—the same reason given in " O Americano , Outra Vez " for his reluctance to experiment with LSD .
Fog is fairly common , particularly in spring and early summer , and the occasional tropical storm or hurricane can threaten the region , especially in late summer and early autumn . Due to its situation along the North Atlantic , the city often receives sea breezes , especially in the late spring , when water temperatures are still quite cold and temperatures at the coast can be more than 20 °F ( 11 °C ) colder than a few miles inland , sometimes dropping by that amount near midday . Thunderstorms occur from May to September , that are occasionally severe with large hail , damaging winds and heavy downpours . Although downtown Boston has never been struck by a violent tornado , the city itself has experienced many tornado warnings . Damaging storms are more common to areas north , west , and northwest of the city . Boston has a relatively sunny climate for a coastal city at its latitude , averaging over 2,600 hours of sunshine per annum .
In Ancient Rome , Tyrian purple was the color of the Emperor , but red had an important religious symbolism . Romans wore togas with red stripes on holidays , and the bride at a wedding wore a red shawl , called a flammeum . Red was used to color statues and the skin of gladiators . Red was also the color associated with army ; Roman soldiers wore red tunics , and officers wore a cloak called a paludamentum which , depending upon the quality of the dye , could be crimson , scarlet or purple . In Roman mythology red is associated with the god of war , Mars . The vexilloid of the Roman Empire had a red background with the letters SPQR in gold . A Roman general receiving a triumph had his entire body painted red in honor of his achievement .
Utrecht hosts several large institutions of higher education . The most prominent of these is Utrecht University ( est . 1636 ) , the largest university of the Netherlands with 30,449 students ( as of 2012 ) . The university is partially based in the inner city as well as in the Uithof campus area , to the east of the city . According to Shanghai Jiaotong University 's university ranking in 2014 it is the 57th best university in the world . Utrecht also houses the much smaller University of Humanistic Studies , which houses about 400 students .
Likewise , group theory helps predict the changes in physical properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition , for example , from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form . An example is ferroelectric materials , where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectic state , accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode , a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition .
At a professional level , most matches produce only a few goals . For example , the 2005–06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match . The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper , but a number of specialised roles have evolved . Broadly , these include three main categories : strikers , or forwards , whose main task is to score goals ; defenders , who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring ; and midfielders , who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team . Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players , to distinguish them from the goalkeeper . These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time . For example , there are central defenders , and left and right midfielders . The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination . The number of players in each position determines the style of the team 's play ; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game , while the reverse creates a slower , more defensive style of play . While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position , there are few restrictions on player movement , and players can switch positions at any time . The layout of a team 's players is known as a formation . Defining the team 's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team 's manager .
The Washington National Records Center ( WNRC ) , located in Suitland , Maryland is a large warehouse type facility which stores federal records which are still under the control of the creating agency . Federal government agencies pay a yearly fee for storage at the facility . In accordance with federal records schedules , documents at WNRC are transferred to the legal custody of the National Archives after a certain point ( this usually involves a relocation of the records to College Park ) . Temporary records at WNRC are either retained for a fee or destroyed after retention times has elapsed . WNRC also offers research services and maintains a small research room .
Japanese land forces continued to advance in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea . From July 1942 , a few Australian reserve battalions , many of them very young and untrained , fought a stubborn rearguard action in New Guinea , against a Japanese advance along the Kokoda Track , towards Port Moresby , over the rugged Owen Stanley Ranges . The militia , worn out and severely depleted by casualties , were relieved in late August by regular troops from the Second Australian Imperial Force , returning from action in the Mediterranean theater . In early September 1942 Japanese marines attacked a strategic Royal Australian Air Force base at Milne Bay , near the eastern tip of New Guinea . They were beaten back by Allied ( primarily Australian Army ) forces .
The book value of the company nearly doubled from $ 8.19 a share in 1999 to $ 15 a share in 2009 . Revenues grew sixfold from 1999 's $ 6 billion to almost $ 36 billion in 2009 . Net profit margin rose from 4.2 % in 1999 to 8.4 % in 2009 , with operating margins improving 31 percent and return on equity doubling to 6.7 percent in the same time span . Between 1999 and 2009 , return on capital nearly tripled to 7 percent . Comcast reported first quarter 2012 profit increases of 30 % due to increase in high-speed internet customers . In February 2014 , Comcast generated 1.1 billion in revenue during the first quarter due to the Sochi Olympics , .
In the dystopian future world of George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-Four , The Times has been transformed into the organ of the totalitarian ruling party , its editorials—of which several are quoted in the book—reflecting Big Brother 's pronouncements .
While the housing and credit bubbles were building , a series of factors caused the financial system to both expand and become increasingly fragile , a process called financialization . U.S. Government policy from the 1970s onward has emphasized deregulation to encourage business , which resulted in less oversight of activities and less disclosure of information about new activities undertaken by banks and other evolving financial institutions . Thus , policymakers did not immediately recognize the increasingly important role played by financial institutions such as investment banks and hedge funds , also known as the shadow banking system . Some experts believe these institutions had become as important as commercial ( depository ) banks in providing credit to the U.S. economy , but they were not subject to the same regulations .
The Mīmāṃsā school has several subschools defined by epistemology . The Prābhākara subschool of Mīmāṃsā considered five epistemically reliable means to gaining knowledge : pratyakṣa ( perception ) , anumāṇa ( inference ) , upamāṇa ( comparison and analogy ) , arthāpatti ( postulation , derivation from circumstances ) , and śabda ( word , testimony of past or present reliable experts ) . The Kumārila Bhaṭṭa sub-school of Mīmāṃsā added sixth to its canon of reliable epistemology - anupalabdi ( non-perception , negative/cognitive proof ) .
Educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings , the effectiveness of educational interventions , the psychology of teaching , and the social psychology of schools as organizations . Although the terms " educational psychology " and " school psychology " are often used interchangeably , researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as educational psychologists , whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as school psychologists . Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as gifted children and those with specific disabilities .
Paris ' disconnect with its suburbs , its lack of suburban transportation in particular , became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration 's growth . Paul Delouvrier promised to resolve the Paris-suburbs mésentente when he became head of the Paris region in 1961 : two of his most ambitious projects for the Region were the construction of five suburban villes nouvelles ( " new cities " ) and the RER commuter train network . Many other suburban residential districts ( grands ensembles ) were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population : these districts were socially mixed at first , but few residents actually owned their homes ( the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s ) . Their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere and their repopulation by those with more limited possibilities .
Early civilisations in Myanmar included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Burma and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Burma . In the 9th century , the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and , following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s , the Burmese language , culture and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country . The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the Mongol invasions and several warring states emerged . In the 16th century , reunified by the Taungoo Dynasty , the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia . The early 19th century Konbaung Dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well . The British conquered Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century and the country became a British colony . Myanmar became an independent nation in 1948 , initially as a democratic nation and then , following a coup d'état in 1962 , a military dictatorship .
Federalism refers to the mixed or compound mode of government , combining a general government ( the central or 'federal ' government ) with regional governments ( provincial , state , Land , cantonal , territorial or other sub-unit governments ) in a single political system . Its distinctive feature , exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism of the United States of America under the Constitution of 1789 , is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established . It can thus be defined as a form of government in which there is a division of powers between two levels of government of equal status .
The design architecture of USB is asymmetrical in its topology , consisting of a host , a multitude of downstream USB ports , and multiple peripheral devices connected in a tiered-star topology . Additional USB hubs may be included in the tiers , allowing branching into a tree structure with up to five tier levels . A USB host may implement multiple host controllers and each host controller may provide one or more USB ports . Up to 127 devices , including hub devices if present , may be connected to a single host controller . USB devices are linked in series through hubs . One hub—built into the host controller—is the root hub .
The majority of Sicilians preferred independence to the Savoia kingdom ; in 1866 , Palermo became the seat of a week-long popular rebellion , which was finally crushed after Martial law was declared . The Italian government blamed anarchists and the Church , specifically the Archbishop of Palermo , for the rebellion and began enacting anti-Sicilian and anti-clerical policies . A new cultural , economic and industrial growth was spurred by several families , like the Florio , the Ducrot , the Rutelli , the Sandron , the Whitaker , the Utveggio , and others . In the early twentieth century Palermo expanded outside the old city walls , mostly to the north along the new boulevards Via Roma , Via Dante , Via Notarbartolo , and Viale della Libertà . These roads would soon boast a huge number of villas in the Art Nouveau style . Many of these were designed by the famous architect Ernesto Basile . The Grand Hotel Villa Igiea , designed by Ernesto Basile for the Florio family , is a good example of Palermitan Art Nouveau . The huge Teatro Massimo was designed in the same period by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile , and built by the Rutelli & Machì building firm of the industrial and old Rutelli Italian family in Palermo , and was opened in 1897 .
Von Neumann raised the intellectual and mathematical level of economics in several stunning publications . For his model of an expanding economy , von Neumann proved the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium using his generalization of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem . Von Neumann 's model of an expanding economy considered the matrix pencil A − λB with nonnegative matrices A and B ; von Neumann sought probability vectors p and q and a positive number λ that would solve the complementarity equation
Some Estonians , unwilling to side directly with the Nazis , joined the Finnish Army ( which was allied with the Nazis ) to fight against the Soviet Union . The Finnish Infantry Regiment 200 ( Estonian : soomepoisid ) was formed out of Estonian volunteers in Finland . Although many Estonians were recruited into the German armed forces ( including Estonian Waffen-SS ) , the majority of them did so only in 1944 when the threat of a new invasion of Estonia by the Red Army had become imminent . In January 1944 Estonia was again facing the prospect of invasion from the Red Army and the last legitimate prime minister of the Republic of Estonia ( according to the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia ) delivered a radio address asking all able-bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for military service . The call resulted in around 38,000 new enlistments and several thousand Estonians who had joined the Finnish Army came back to join the newly formed Territorial Defense Force , assigned to defend Estonia against the Soviet advance . It was hoped [ by whom ? ] that by engaging in such a war Estonia would be able to attract Western support for Estonian independence .
Plants and various other groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes collectively known as " algae " have unique organelles known as chloroplasts . Chloroplasts are thought to be descended from cyanobacteria that formed endosymbiotic relationships with ancient plant and algal ancestors . Chloroplasts and cyanobacteria contain the blue-green pigment chlorophyll a. Chlorophyll a ( as well as its plant and green algal-specific cousin chlorophyll b ) [ a ] absorbs light in the blue-violet and orange/red parts of the spectrum while reflecting and transmitting the green light that we see as the characteristic colour of these organisms . The energy in the red and blue light that these pigments absorb is used by chloroplasts to make energy-rich carbon compounds from carbon dioxide and water by oxygenic photosynthesis , a process that generates molecular oxygen ( O2 ) as a by-product .

Tehran is the country 's capital and largest city , as well as its leading cultural and economic center . Iran is a major regional and middle power , exerting considerable influence in international energy security and the world economy through its large reserves of fossil fuels , which include the largest natural gas supply in the world and the fourth-largest proven oil reserves . Iran 's rich cultural legacy is reflected in part by its 19 UNESCO World Heritage Sites , the fourth-largest number in Asia and 12th-largest in the world .
Himachal has a rich heritage of handicrafts . These include woolen and pashmina shawls , carpets , silver and metal ware , embroidered chappals , grass shoes , Kangra and Gompa style paintings , wood work , horse-hair bangles , wooden and metal utensils and various other house hold items . These aesthetic and tasteful handicrafts declined under competition from machine made goods and also because of lack of marketing facilities . But now the demand for handicrafts has increased within and outside the country .
Chromobacterium violaceum and Pseudomonas fluorescens can both mobilize solid copper , as a cyanide compound . The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi associated with Calluna , Erica and Vaccinium can grow in copper metalliferous soils . The ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus protects young pine trees from copper toxicity . A sample of the fungus Aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining solution ; and was found to contain cyano metal complexes ; such as gold , silver , copper iron and zinc . The fungus also plays a role in the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides .
After the Dambusters raid in 1943 an entirely new system was developed that was required to knock down any low-flying aircraft with a single hit . The first attempt to produce such a system used a 50 mm gun , but this proved inaccurate and a new 55 mm gun replaced it . The system used a centralised control system including both search and targeting radar , which calculated the aim point for the guns after considering windage and ballistics , and then sent electrical commands to the guns , which used hydraulics to point themselves at high speeds . Operators simply fed the guns and selected the targets . This system , modern even by today 's standards , was in late development when the war ended .
Political parties , still called factions by some , especially those in the governmental apparatus , are lobbied vigorously by organizations , businesses and special interest groups such as trade unions . Money and gifts-in-kind to a party , or its leading members , may be offered as incentives . Such donations are the traditional source of funding for all right-of-centre cadre parties . Starting in the late 19th century these parties were opposed by the newly founded left-of-centre workers ' parties . They started a new party type , the mass membership party , and a new source of political fundraising , membership dues .
Since the Spanish transition to democracy ( 1975–1982 ) , Catalan has been institutionalizated as an official language , language of education , and language of mass media ; all of which have contributed to its increased prestige . In Catalonia , there is no parallel of a large , bilingual , European , non-state speech community . The teaching of Catalan is mandatory in all schools , but it is possible to use Spanish for studying in the public education system of Catalonia in two situations , if the teacher assigned to a class chooses to use Spanish , or during the learning process of one or some recently arrived students . There is also some intergenerational shift towards Catalan .
where is the maximum possible exposure that does not lead to a clipped or bloomed camera output . Typically , the lower limit of the saturation speed is determined by the sensor itself , but with the gain of the amplifier between the sensor and the analog-to-digital converter , the saturation speed can be increased . The factor 78 is chosen such that exposure settings based on a standard light meter and an 18-percent reflective surface will result in an image with a grey level of 18 % /√2 = 12.7 % of saturation . The factor √2 indicates that there is half a stop of headroom to deal with specular reflections that would appear brighter than a 100 % reflecting white surface .
The study of the molecular and cellular components that comprise the immune system , including their function and interaction , is the central science of immunology . The immune system has been divided into a more primitive innate immune system and , in vertebrates , an acquired or adaptive immune system . The latter is further divided into humoral ( or antibody ) and cell-mediated components .
Nazi Germany terminated the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact at 03:15 on 22 June 1941 by launching a massive attack on the Soviet positions in eastern Poland which marked the beginning of the invasion of the Soviet Union known as Operation Barbarossa . Stalin had ignored several warnings that Germany was likely to invade , and ordered no 'full-scale ' mobilization of forces although the mobilization was ongoing . After the launch of the invasion , the territories gained by the Soviet Union as a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact were lost in a matter of weeks . Within six months , the Soviet military had suffered 4.3 million casualties , and Germany had captured three million Soviet prisoners . The lucrative export of Soviet raw materials to Nazi Germany over the course of the Nazi–Soviet economic relations ( 1934–41 ) continued uninterrupted until the outbreak of hostilities . The Soviet exports in several key areas enabled Germany to maintain its stocks of rubber and grain from the first day of the invasion until October 1941 .
The eastern arm shows considerable diversity . In England it is generally long and may have two distinct sections , both choir and presbytery . It is often square ended or has a projecting Lady Chapel , dedicated to the Virgin Mary . In France the eastern end is often polygonal and surrounded by a walkway called an ambulatory and sometimes a ring of chapels called a " chevet " . While German churches are often similar to those of France , in Italy , the eastern projection beyond the transept is usually just a shallow apsidal chapel containing the sanctuary , as at Florence Cathedral .
During the Gilded Age , there was substantial growth in population in the United States and extravagant displays of wealth and excess of America 's upper-class during the post-Civil War and post-Reconstruction era , in the late 19th century . The wealth polarization derived primarily from industrial and population expansion . The businessmen of the Second Industrial Revolution created industrial towns and cities in the Northeast with new factories , and contributed to the creation of an ethnically diverse industrial working class which produced the wealth owned by rising super-rich industrialists and financiers called the " robber barons " . An example is the company of John D. Rockefeller , who was an important figure in shaping the new oil industry . Using highly effective tactics and aggressive practices , later widely criticized , Standard Oil absorbed or destroyed most of its competition .
Following a headlining set at Coachella 2011 that was described by The Hollywood Reporter as " one of greatest hip-hop sets of all time " , West released the collaborative album Watch the Throne with Jay-Z . By employing a sales strategy that released the album digitally weeks before its physical counterpart , Watch the Throne became one of the few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak . " Niggas in Paris " became the record 's highest charting single , peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 . In 2012 , West released the compilation album Cruel Summer , a collection of tracks by artists from West 's record label GOOD Music . Cruel Summer produced four singles , two of which charted within the top twenty of the Hot 100 : " Mercy " and " Clique " . West also directed a film of the same name that premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival in custom pyramid-shaped screening pavilion featuring seven screens .
In Western Europe , some of the older Roman elite families died out while others became more involved with Church than secular affairs . Values attached to Latin scholarship and education mostly disappeared , and while literacy remained important , it became a practical skill rather than a sign of elite status . In the 4th century , Jerome ( d. 420 ) dreamed that God rebuked him for spending more time reading Cicero than the Bible . By the 6th century , Gregory of Tours ( d. 594 ) had a similar dream , but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero , he was chastised for learning shorthand . By the late 6th century , the principal means of religious instruction in the Church had become music and art rather than the book . Most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship , but some original works were created , along with now-lost oral compositions . The writings of Sidonius Apollinaris ( d. 489 ) , Cassiodorus ( d. c. 585 ) , and Boethius ( d. c. 525 ) were typical of the age .
According to Dr. Carlos Moore , resident scholar at Brazil 's University of the State of Bahia , in the 21st century Afro-multiracials in the Arab world , including Arabs in North Africa , self-identify in ways that resemble multi-racials in Latin America . He claims that black-looking Arabs , much like black-looking Latin Americans , consider themselves white because they have some distant white ancestry .
Montana 's motto , Oro y Plata , Spanish for " Gold and Silver " , recognizing the significant role of mining , was first adopted in 1865 , when Montana was still a territory . A state seal with a miner 's pick and shovel above the motto , surrounded by the mountains and the Great Falls of the Missouri River , was adopted during the first meeting of the territorial legislature in 1864–65 . The design was only slightly modified after Montana became a state and adopted it as the Great Seal of the State of Montana , enacted by the legislature in 1893 . The state flower , the bitterroot , was adopted in 1895 with the support of a group called the Floral Emblem Association , which formed after Montana 's Women 's Christian Temperance Union adopted the bitterroot as the organization 's state flower . All other symbols were adopted throughout the 20th century , save for Montana 's newest symbol , the state butterfly , the mourning cloak , adopted in 2001 , and the state lullaby , " Montana Lullaby " , adopted in 2007 .
The Portuguese currency is the euro ( € ) , which replaced the Portuguese Escudo , and the country was one of the original member states of the eurozone . Portugal 's central bank is the Banco de Portugal , an integral part of the European System of Central Banks . Most industries , businesses and financial institutions are concentrated in the Lisbon and Porto metropolitan areas—the Setúbal , Aveiro , Braga , Coimbra and Leiria districts are the biggest economic centres outside these two main areas . [ citation needed ] According to World Travel Awards , Portugal is the Europe 's Leading Golf Destination 2012 and 2013 .
Some Christian writers considered the possibility that pagan commentators may have mentioned this event , mistaking it for a solar eclipse - although this would have been impossible during the Passover , which takes place at the full moon . Christian traveller and historian Sextus Julius Africanus and Christian theologian Origen refer to Greek historian Phlegon , who lived in the 2nd century AD , as having written " with regard to the eclipse in the time of Tiberius Caesar , in whose reign Jesus appears to have been crucified , and the great earthquakes which then took place "
The caricature of the period is also reflected in some more specific notions . One misconception , first propagated in the 19th century and still very common , is that all people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth was flat . This is untrue , as lecturers in the medieval universities commonly argued that evidence showed the Earth was a sphere . Lindberg and Ronald Numbers , another scholar of the period , state that there " was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [ Earth 's ] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference " . Other misconceptions such as " the Church prohibited autopsies and dissections during the Middle Ages " , " the rise of Christianity killed off ancient science " , or " the medieval Christian church suppressed the growth of natural philosophy " , are all cited by Numbers as examples of widely popular myths that still pass as historical truth , although they are not supported by current historical research .
During the revival , in 1809 linguist and historian Josef Dobrovský released a German-language grammar of Old Czech entitled Ausführliches Lehrgebäude der böhmischen Sprache ( Comprehensive Doctrine of the Bohemian Language ) . Dobrovský had intended his book to be descriptive , and did not think Czech had a realistic chance of returning as a major language . However , Josef Jungmann and other revivalists used Dobrovský 's book to advocate for a Czech linguistic revival . Changes during this time included spelling reform ( notably , í in place of the former j and j in place of g ) , the use of t ( rather than ti ) to end infinitive verbs and the non-capitalization of nouns ( which had been a late borrowing from German ) . These changes differentiated Czech from Slovak . Modern scholars disagree about whether the conservative revivalists were motivated by nationalism or considered contemporary spoken Czech unsuitable for formal , widespread use .
Although theoretically a collegial body operating through consensus building , Gaddafi dominated the RCC , although some of the others attempted to constrain what they saw as his excesses . Gaddafi remained the government 's public face , with the identities of the other RCC members only being publicly revealed on 10 January 1970 . All young men from ( typically rural ) working and middle-class backgrounds , none had university degrees ; in this way they were distinct from the wealthy , highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country .
Morality plays emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished until 1550 . The most interesting morality play is The Castle of Perseverance which depicts mankind 's progress from birth to death . However , the most famous morality play and perhaps best known medieval drama is Everyman . Everyman receives Death 's summons , struggles to escape and finally resigns himself to necessity . Along the way , he is deserted by Kindred , Goods , and Fellowship - only Good Deeds goes with him to the grave .
Asthma is the result of chronic inflammation of the conducting zone of the airways ( most especially the bronchi and bronchioles ) , which subsequently results in increased contractability of the surrounding smooth muscles . This among other factors leads to bouts of narrowing of the airway and the classic symptoms of wheezing . The narrowing is typically reversible with or without treatment . Occasionally the airways themselves change . Typical changes in the airways include an increase in eosinophils and thickening of the lamina reticularis . Chronically the airways ' smooth muscle may increase in size along with an increase in the numbers of mucous glands . Other cell types involved include : T lymphocytes , macrophages , and neutrophils . There may also be involvement of other components of the immune system including : cytokines , chemokines , histamine , and leukotrienes among others .
Anthropologists maintain that hunter/gatherers do n't have permanent leaders ; instead , the person taking the initiative at any one time depends on the task being performed . In addition to social and economic equality in hunter-gatherer societies , there is often , though not always , sexual parity as well . Hunter-gatherers are often grouped together based on kinship and band ( or tribe ) membership . Postmarital residence among hunter-gatherers tends to be matrilocal , at least initially . Young mothers can enjoy childcare support from their own mothers , who continue living nearby in the same camp . The systems of kinship and descent among human hunter-gatherers were relatively flexible , although there is evidence that early human kinship in general tended to be matrilineal .
The United States Army ( USA ) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations . It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution , Article 2 , Section 2 , Clause 1 and United States Code , Title 10 , Subtitle B , Chapter 301 , Section 3001 . As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military , the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army , which was formed ( 14 June 1775 ) to fight the American Revolutionary War ( 1775–83 ) —before the U.S. was established as a country . After the Revolutionary War , the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 , to replace the disbanded Continental Army . The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army , and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775 .
In South Africa , the period of colonization resulted in many unions and marriages between European men and African women from various tribes , resulting in mixed-race children . As the Europeans acquired territory and imposed rule over the Africans , they generally pushed mixed-race and Africans into second-class status . During the first half of the 20th century , the Afrikaaner-dominated government classified the population according to four main racial groups : Black , White , Asian ( mostly Indian ) , and Coloured . The Coloured group included people of mixed Bantu , Khoisan , and European descent ( with some Malay ancestry , especially in the Western Cape ) . The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa . It imposed a system of legal racial segregation , a complex of laws known as apartheid .
The Carolingian dynasty , as the successors to Charles Martel are known , officially took control of the kingdoms of Austrasia and Neustria in a coup of 753 led by Pippin III ( r. 752–768 ) . A contemporary chronicle claims that Pippin sought , and gained , authority for this coup from Pope Stephen II ( pope 752–757 ) . Pippin 's takeover was reinforced with propaganda that portrayed the Merovingians as inept or cruel rulers , exalted the accomplishments of Charles Martel , and circulated stories of the family 's great piety . At the time of his death in 768 , Pippin left his kingdom in the hands of his two sons , Charles ( r. 768–814 ) and Carloman ( r. 768–771 ) . When Carloman died of natural causes , Charles blocked the succession of Carloman 's young son and installed himself as the king of the united Austrasia and Neustria . Charles , more often known as Charles the Great or Charlemagne , embarked upon a programme of systematic expansion in 774 that unified a large portion of Europe , eventually controlling modern-day France , northern Italy , and Saxony . In the wars that lasted beyond 800 , he rewarded allies with war booty and command over parcels of land . In 774 , Charlemagne conquered the Lombards , which freed the papacy from the fear of Lombard conquest and marked the beginnings of the Papal States . [ L ]
Beyoncé and her mother introduced House of Deréon , a contemporary women 's fashion line , in 2005 . The concept is inspired by three generations of women in their family , the name paying tribute to Beyoncé 's grandmother , Agnèz Deréon , a respected seamstress . According to Tina , the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé 's taste and style . Beyoncé and her mother founded their family 's company Beyond Productions , which provides the licensing and brand management for House of Deréon , and its junior collection , Deréon . House of Deréon pieces were exhibited in Destiny 's Child 's shows and tours , during their Destiny Fulfilled era . The collection features sportswear , denim offerings with fur , outerwear and accessories that include handbags and footwear , and are available at department and specialty stores across the US and Canada .
For customers with more demanding requirements ( such as medium-to-large businesses , or other ISPs ) can use higher-speed DSL ( such as single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line ) , Ethernet , metropolitan Ethernet , gigabit Ethernet , Frame Relay , ISDN Primary Rate Interface , ATM ( Asynchronous Transfer Mode ) and synchronous optical networking ( SONET ) .
Laurisilva is a unique type of subtropical rainforest found in few areas of Europe and the world : in the Azores , and in particular on the island of Madeira , there are large forests of endemic Laurisilva forests ( the latter protected as a natural heritage preserve ) . There are several species of diverse mammalian fauna , including the fox , badger , iberian lynx , iberian wolf , wild goat ( Capra pyrenaica ) , wild cat ( Felis silvestris ) , hare , weasel , polecat , chameleon , mongoose , civet , brown bear [ citation needed ] ( spotted near Rio Minho , close to Peneda-Gerês ) and many others . Portugal is an important stopover for migratory birds , in places such as Cape St. Vincent or the Monchique mountains , where thousands of birds cross from Europe to Africa during the autumn or in the spring ( return migration ) .
Hydrostatic gauges ( such as the mercury column manometer ) consist of a vertical column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures . The column will rise or fall until its weight is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube . The simplest design is a closed-end U-shaped tube , one side of which is connected to the region of interest . Any fluid can be used , but mercury is preferred for its high density and low vapour pressure . Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from 1 torr ( 100 Pa ) to above atmospheric . An important variation is the McLeod gauge which isolates a known volume of vacuum and compresses it to multiply the height variation of the liquid column . The McLeod gauge can measure vacuums as high as 10−6 torr ( 0.1 mPa ) , which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology . Other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures , but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure-controlled properties . These indirect measurements must be calibrated via a direct measurement , most commonly a McLeod gauge .
On 25 September , Seoul was recaptured by South Korean forces . American air raids caused heavy damage to the KPA , destroying most of its tanks and much of its artillery . North Korean troops in the south , instead of effectively withdrawing north , rapidly disintegrated , leaving Pyongyang vulnerable . During the general retreat only 25,000 to 30,000 soldiers managed to rejoin the Northern KPA lines . On 27 September , Stalin convened an emergency session of the Politburo , in which he condemned the incompetence of the KPA command and held Soviet military advisers responsible for the defeat .
Napoleon III responded with a show of force , sending the ship of the line Charlemagne to the Black Sea . This action was a violation of the London Straits Convention . :104:19 Thus , France 's show of force presented a real threat , and when combined with aggressive diplomacy and money , induced the Ottoman Sultan Abdülmecid I to accept a new treaty , confirming France and the Roman Catholic Church as the supreme Christian authority with control over the Roman Catholic holy places and possession of the keys to the Church of the Nativity , previously held by the Greek Orthodox Church . :20
Turner Classic Movies essentially operates as a commercial-free service , with the only advertisements on the network being shown between features – which advertise TCM products , network promotions for upcoming special programs and the original trailers for films that are scheduled to be broadcast on TCM ( particularly those that will air during the primetime hours ) , and featurettes about classic film actors and actresses . In addition to this , extended breaks between features are filled with theatrically released movie trailers and classic short subjects – from series such as The Passing Parade , Crime Does Not Pay , Pete Smith Specialties , and Robert Benchley – under the banner name TCM Extras ( formerly One Reel Wonders ) . In 2007 , some of the short films featured on TCM were made available for streaming on TCM 's website . Partly to allow these interstitials , Turner Classic Movies schedules its feature films either at the top of the hour or at :15 , :30 or :45 minutes past the hour , instead of in timeslots of varying five-minute increments .
The finale is the two-hour last episode of the season , culminating in revealing the winner . For seasons one , three through six , and fourteen , it was broadcast from the Dolby Theatre , which has an audience capacity of approximately 3,400 . The finale for season two took place at the Gibson Amphitheatre , which has an audience capacity of over 6,000 . In seasons seven through thirteen , the venue was at the Nokia Theatre , which holds an audience of over 7,000 .
New Haven has a variety of museums , many of them associated with Yale . The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library features an original copy of the Gutenberg Bible . There is also the Connecticut Children 's Museum ; the Knights of Columbus museum near that organization 's world headquarters ; the Peabody Museum of Natural History ; the Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments ; the Eli Whitney Museum ( across the town line in Hamden , Connecticut , on Whitney Avenue ) ; the Yale Center for British Art , which houses the largest collection of British art outside the U.K. , and the Yale University Art Gallery , the nation 's oldest college art museum .

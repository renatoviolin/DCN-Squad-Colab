Initially , officials were unable to contact the Wolong National Nature Reserve , home to around 280 giant pandas . However , the Foreign Ministry later said that a group of 31 British tourists visiting the Wolong Panda Reserve in the quake-hit area returned safe and uninjured to Chengdu . Nonetheless , the well-being of an even greater number of pandas in the neighbouring panda reserves remained unknown . Five security guards at the reserve were killed by the earthquake . Six pandas escaped after their enclosures were damaged . By May 20 , two pandas at the reserve were found to be injured , while the search continued for another two adult pandas that went missing after the quake . By May 28 , 2008 , one panda was still missing . The missing panda was later found dead under the rubble of an enclosure . Nine-year-old Mao Mao , a mother of five at the breeding center , was discovered on Monday , her body crushed by a wall in her enclosure . Panda keepers and other workers placed her remains in a small wooden crate and buried her outside the breeding centre .
The map of earthquake intensity published by CEA after surveying 500,000 km2 of the affected area shows a maximum liedu of XI on the China Seismic Intensity Scale ( CSIS ) , described as " very destructive " on the European Macroseismic Scale ( EMS ) from which CSIS drew reference . ( USGS , using the Modified Mercalli intensity scale ( CC ) , also placed maximum intensity at XI , " very disastrous " . ) Two south-west-north-east stripes of liedu XI are centered around Yingxiu , Wenchuan ( the town closest to the epicenter of the main quake ) and Beichuan ( the town repeatedly struck by strong aftershocks including one registering MS 6.1 on Aug 1 , 2008 ) , both in Sichuan Province , occupying a total of 2,419 km2 . The Yingxiu liedu-XI zone is about 66 km long and 20 km wide along Wenchuan–Dujiangyan–Pengzhou ; the Beichuan liedu-XI zone is about 82 km long and 15 km wide along An County–Beichuan–Pingwu . The area with liedu X ( comparable to X on EMS , " destructive " and X on MM , " disastrous " ) spans 3,144 km2 . The area affected by earthquakes exceeding liedu VI totals 440,442 km2 , occupying an oval 936 km long and 596 km wide , spanning three provinces and one autonomous region .
In breeding circles , a male canine is referred to as a dog , while a female is called a bitch ( Middle English bicche , from Old English bicce , ultimately from Old Norse bikkja ) . A group of offspring is a litter . The father of a litter is called the sire , and the mother is called the dam . Offspring are , in general , called pups or puppies , from French poupée , until they are about a year old . The process of birth is whelping , from the Old English word hwelp .
The Edwardian era in the United Kingdom is the period spanning the reign of King Edward VII up to the end of the First World War , including the years surrounding the sinking of the RMS Titanic . In the early years of the period , the Second Boer War in South Africa split the country into anti- and pro-war factions . The imperial policies of the Conservatives eventually proved unpopular and in the general election of 1906 the Liberals won a huge landslide . The Liberal government was unable to proceed with all of its radical programme without the support of the House of Lords , which was largely Conservative . Conflict between the two Houses of Parliament over the People 's Budget led to a reduction in the power of the peers in 1910 . The general election in January that year returned a hung parliament with the balance of power held by Labour and Irish Nationalist members .
In 1629 , the Massachusetts Bay Colony 's first governor , John Winthrop , led the signing of the Cambridge Agreement , a key founding document of the city . Puritan ethics and their focus on education influenced its early history ; America 's first public school was founded in Boston in 1635 . Over the next 130 years , the city participated in four French and Indian Wars , until the British defeated the French and their native allies in North America . Boston was the largest town in British North America until Philadelphia grew larger in the mid 18th century .
Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of Paris in 1848 . His successor , Napoleon III , and the newly appointed prefect of the Seine , Georges-Eugène Haussmann , launched a gigantic public works project to build wide new boulevards , a new opera house , a central market , new aqueducts , sewers , and parks , including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes . In 1860 , Napoleon III also annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements , expanding Paris to its current limits .
Institutes of technology with different origins are Asian Institute of Technology , which developed from SEATO Graduate School of Engineering , and Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology , an engineering school of Thammasat University . Suranaree University of Technology is the only government-owned technological university in Thailand that was established ( 1989 ) as such ; while Mahanakorn University of Technology is the most well known private technological institute . Technology/Technical colleges in Thailand is associated with bitter rivalries which erupts into frequent off-campus brawls and assassinations of students in public locations that has been going on for nearly a decade , with innocent bystanders also commonly among the injured and the military under martial law still unable to stop them from occurring .
New York is a global hub of international business and commerce . In 2012 , New York City topped the first Global Economic Power Index , published by The Atlantic ( to be differentiated from a namesake list published by the Martin Prosperity Institute ) , with cities ranked according to criteria reflecting their presence on similar lists as published by other entities . The city is a major center for banking and finance , retailing , world trade , transportation , tourism , real estate , new media as well as traditional media , advertising , legal services , accountancy , insurance , theater , fashion , and the arts in the United States ; while Silicon Alley , metonymous for New York 's broad-spectrum high technology sphere , continues to expand . The Port of New York and New Jersey is also a major economic engine , handling record cargo volume in the first half of 2014 .
Temperatures below 0 °C ( 32 °F ) or above 25 °C ( 77 °F ) are rare . Cork Airport records an average of 1,227.9 millimetres ( 4.029 ft ) of precipitation annually , most of which is rain . The airport records an average of 7 days of hail and 11 days of snow or sleet a year ; though it only records lying snow for 2 days of the year . The low altitude of the city , and moderating influences of the harbour , mean that lying snow very rarely occurs in the city itself . There are on average 204 " rainy " days a year ( over 0.2 millimetres ( 0.0079 in ) of rainfall ) , of which there are 73 days with " heavy rain " ( over 5 millimetres ( 0.20 in ) ) . Cork is also a generally foggy city , with an average of 97 days of fog a year , most common during mornings and during winter . Despite this , however , Cork is also one of Ireland 's sunniest cities , with an average of 3.9 hours of sunshine every day and only having 67 days where there is no " recordable sunshine " , mostly during and around winter .
Roman government was headed by two consuls , elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate composed of appointed magistrates . As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards , the evolution of the Roman government was heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians , Rome 's land-holding aristocracy , who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome , and the plebeians , the far more numerous citizen-commoners . Over time , the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome 's highest offices were repealed or weakened , and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy . The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war , making military and political success inextricably linked . Many of Rome 's legal and legislative structures ( later codified into the Justinian Code , and again into the Napoleonic Code ) can still be observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern nation states and international organizations .
The Marshall Islands , officially the Republic of the Marshall Islands ( Marshallese : Aolepān Aorōkin M̧ajeļ ) , [ note 1 ] is an island country located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean , slightly west of the International Date Line . Geographically , the country is part of the larger island group of Micronesia . The country 's population of 53,158 people ( at the 2011 Census ) is spread out over 29 coral atolls , comprising 1,156 individual islands and islets . The islands share maritime boundaries with the Federated States of Micronesia to the west , Wake Island to the north , [ note 2 ] Kiribati to the south-east , and Nauru to the south . About 27,797 of the islanders ( at the 2011 Census ) live on Majuro , which contains the capital .
Season 11 premiered on January 18 , 2012 . On February 23 , it was announced that one more finalist would join the Top 24 making it the Top 25 , and that was Jermaine Jones . However , on March 14 , Jones was disqualified in 12th place for concealing arrests and outstanding warrants . Jones denied the accusation that he concealed his arrests .
Hazards to aircraft include debris , nesting birds , and reduced friction levels due to environmental conditions such as ice , snow , or rain . Part of runway maintenance is airfield rubber removal which helps maintain friction levels . The fields must be kept clear of debris using cleaning equipment so that loose material does not become a projectile and enter an engine duct ( see foreign object damage ) . In adverse weather conditions , ice and snow clearing equipment can be used to improve traction on the landing strip . For waiting aircraft , equipment is used to spray special deicing fluids on the wings .
By the late 1960s , many of the resort 's once great hotels were suffering from embarrassing vacancy rates . Most of them were either shut down , converted to cheap apartments , or converted to nursing home facilities by the end of the decade . Prior to and during the advent of legalized gaming , many of these hotels were demolished . The Breakers , the Chelsea , the Brighton , the Shelburne , the Mayflower , the Traymore , and the Marlborough-Blenheim were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s . Of the many pre-casino resorts that bordered the boardwalk , only the Claridge , the Dennis , the Ritz-Carlton , and the Haddon Hall survive to this day as parts of Bally 's Atlantic City , a condo complex , and Resorts Atlantic City . The old Ambassador Hotel was purchased by Ramada in 1978 and was gutted to become the Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City , only reusing the steelwork of the original building . Smaller hotels off the boardwalk , such as the Madison also survived .
Players may only be transferred during transfer windows that are set by the Football Association . The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January . Player registrations can not be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA , usually on an emergency basis . As of the 2010–11 season , the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21 , with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances . This was to enable the 'home grown ' rule to be enacted , whereby the League would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to be made up of 'home-grown players ' .
In ancient China , early literature was primarily focused on philosophy , historiography , military science , agriculture , and poetry . China , the origin of modern paper making and woodblock printing , produced one of the world 's first print cultures . Much of Chinese literature originates with the Hundred Schools of Thought period that occurred during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty ( 769-269 BCE ) . The most important of these include the Classics of Confucianism , of Daoism , of Mohism , of Legalism , as well as works of military science ( e.g . Sun Tzu 's The Art of War ) and Chinese history ( e.g . Sima Qian 's Records of the Grand Historian ) . Ancient Chinese literature had a heavy emphasis on historiography , with often very detailed court records . An exemplary piece of narrative history of ancient China was the Zuo Zhuan , which was compiled no later than 389 BCE , and attributed to the blind 5th century BCE historian Zuo Qiuming .
Genocide has become an official term used in international relations . The word genocide was not in use before 1944 . Before this , in 1941 , Winston Churchill described the mass killing of Russian prisoners of war and civilians as " a crime without a name " . In that year , a Polish-Jewish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin , described the policies of systematic murder founded by the Nazis as genocide . The word genocide is the combination of the Greek prefix geno- ( meaning tribe or race ) and caedere ( the Latin word for to kill ) . The word is defined as a specific set of violent crimes that are committed against a certain group with the attempt to remove the entire group from existence or to destroy them .
After Austerlitz , Napoleon established the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 . A collection of German states intended to serve as a buffer zone between France and Central Europe , the creation of the Confederation spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire and significantly alarmed the Prussians . The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region , if not eliminating it outright . War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806 . At the insistence of his court , especially his wife Queen Louise , Frederick William III decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war .
There are several technologies aimed to provide better experience to passengers suffering from claustrophobia , anthropophobia or social anxiety . Israeli startup DigiGage uses motion sensors to scroll the pre-rendered images , building and floor-specific content on a screen embedded into the wall as the cab moves up and down . British company LiftEye provides a virtual window technology to turn common elevator into panoramic . It creates 3d video panorama using live feed from cameras placed vertically along the facade and synchronizes it with cab movement . The video is projected on a wall-sized screens making it look like the walls are made of glass .
Among the largest non-state-run research institutions in Portugal are the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência and the Champalimaud Foundation , a neuroscience and oncology research centre , which in addition awards every year one of the highest monetary prizes of any science prize in the world . A number of both national and multinational high-tech and industrial companies , are also responsible for research and development projects . One of the oldest learned societies of Portugal is the Sciences Academy of Lisbon , founded in 1779 .
The years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the " Big Four " with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City both breaking into the top four . In the 2009–10 season , Tottenham finished fourth and became the first team to break the top four since Everton in 2005 . Criticism of the gap between an elite group of " super clubs " and the majority of the Premier League has continued , nevertheless , due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs . Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season , becoming the first club outside the " Big Four " to win since 1994–95 . That season also saw two of the Big Four ( Chelsea and Liverpool ) finish outside the top four places for the first time since 1994–95 .
In physics , Whitehead 's thought has had some influence . He articulated a view that might perhaps be regarded as dual to Einstein 's general relativity , see Whitehead 's theory of gravitation . It has been severely criticized . Yutaka Tanaka , who suggests that the gravitational constant disagrees with experimental findings , proposes that Einstein 's work does not actually refute Whitehead 's formulation . Whitehead 's view has now been rendered obsolete , with the discovery of gravitational waves . They are phenonena observed locally that largely violate the kind of local flatness of space that Whitehead assumes . Consequently , Whitehead 's cosmology must be regarded as a local approximation , and his assumption of a uniform spatio-temporal geometry , Minkowskian in particular , as an often-locally-adequate approximation . An exact replacement of Whitehead 's cosmology would need to admit a Riemannian geometry . Also , although Whitehead himself gave only secondary consideration to quantum theory , his metaphysics of processes has proved attractive to some physicists in that field . Henry Stapp and David Bohm are among those whose work has been influenced by Whitehead .
Another aspect of anti-aircraft defence was the use of barrage balloons to act as physical obstacle initially to bomber aircraft over cities and later for ground attack aircraft over the Normandy invasion fleets . The balloon , a simple blimp tethered to the ground , worked in two ways . Firstly , it and the steel cable were a danger to any aircraft that tried to fly among them . Secondly , to avoid the balloons , bombers had to fly at a higher altitude , which was more favorable for the guns . Barrage balloons were limited in application , and had minimal success at bringing down aircraft , being largely immobile and passive defences .
The Bovington signal course 's director reported that Gaddafi successfully overcame problems learning English , displaying a firm command of voice procedure . Noting that Gaddafi 's favourite hobbies were reading and playing football , he thought him an " amusing officer , always cheerful , hard-working , and conscientious . " Gaddafi disliked England , claiming British Army officers racially insulted him and finding it difficult adjusting to the country 's culture ; asserting his Arab identity in London , he walked around Piccadilly wearing traditional Libyan robes . He later related that while he travelled to England believing it more advanced than Libya , he returned home " more confident and proud of our values , ideals and social character . "
Ephesus is a cultic centre of Mary , the site of the first Church dedicated to her and the rumoured place of her death . Ephesus was previously a centre for worship of Artemis a virgin goddess . The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus being regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World The cult of Mary was furthered by Queen Theodora in the 6th Century . According to William E. Phipps , in the book Survivals of Roman Religion " Gordon Laing argues convincingly that the worship of Artemis as both virgin and mother at the grand Ephesian temple contributed to the veneration of Mary . "
Since the 2010 election , the government has embarked on a series of reforms to direct the country towards liberal democracy , a mixed economy , and reconciliation , although doubts persist about the motives that underpin such reforms . The series of reforms includes the release of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest , the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission , the granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners , new labour laws that permit labour unions and strikes , a relaxation of press censorship , and the regulation of currency practices .
Paris ' manufacturing is mostly focused in its suburbs , and the city itself has only around 75,000 manufacturing workers , most of which are in the textile , clothing , leather goods and shoe trades . Paris region manufacturing specialises in transportation , mainly automobiles , aircraft and trains , but this is in a sharp decline : Paris proper manufacturing jobs dropped by 64 percent between 1990 and 2010 , and the Paris region lost 48 percent during the same period . Most of this is due to companies relocating outside the Paris region . The Paris region 's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000 . Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers : many of these are centred in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citroen plants ( this department alone employs 33,000 ) , but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citroen assembly plant .
Animals are also involved in the distribution of seeds . Fruit , which is formed by the enlargement of flower parts , is frequently a seed-dispersal tool that attracts animals to eat or otherwise disturb it , incidentally scattering the seeds it contains ( see frugivory ) . Although many such mutualistic relationships remain too fragile to survive competition and to spread widely , flowering proved to be an unusually effective means of reproduction , spreading ( whatever its origin ) to become the dominant form of land plant life .
Dallin H. Oaks replaced Wilkinson as president in 1971 . Oaks continued the expansion of his predecessor , adding a law school and proposing plans for a new School of Management . During his administration , a new library was also added , doubling the library space on campus . Jeffrey R. Holland followed as president in 1980 , encouraging a combination of educational excellence and religious faith at the university . He believed that one of the school 's greatest strengths was its religious nature and that this should be taken advantage of rather than hidden . During his administration , the university added a campus in Jerusalem , now called the BYU Jerusalem Center . In 1989 , Holland was replaced by Rex E. Lee . Lee was responsible for the Benson Science Building and the Museum of Art on campus . A cancer victim , Lee is memorialized annually at BYU during a cancer fundraiser called the Rex Lee Run . Shortly before his death , Lee was replaced in 1995 by Merrill J. Bateman .
The title of " world 's oldest airport " is disputed , but College Park Airport in Maryland , US , established in 1909 by Wilbur Wright , is generally agreed to be the world 's oldest continually operating airfield , although it serves only general aviation traffic . Bisbee-Douglas International Airport in Arizona was declared " the first international airport of the Americas " by US president Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1943 . Pearson Field Airport in Vancouver , Washington had a dirigible land in 1905 and planes in 1911 and is still in use . Bremen Airport opened in 1913 and remains in use , although it served as an American military field between 1945 and 1949 . Amsterdam Airport Schiphol opened on September 16 , 1916 as a military airfield , but only accepted civil aircraft from December 17 , 1920 , allowing Sydney Airport in Sydney , Australia—which started operations in January 1920—to claim to be one of the world 's oldest continually operating commercial airports . Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport in Minneapolis-Saint Paul , Minnesota , opened in 1920 and has been in continuous commercial service since . It serves about 35,000,000 passengers each year and continues to expand , recently opening a new 11,000 foot ( 3,355 meter ) runway . Of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation , it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating . Rome Ciampino Airport , opened 1916 , is also a contender , as well as the Don Mueang International Airport near Bangkok , Thailand , which opened in 1914 . Increased aircraft traffic during World War I led to the construction of landing fields . Aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope .
In the Papal States , which existed until 1870 , Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called ghettos . In the 19th and ( before the end of World War II ) 20th centuries , the Roman Catholic Church adhered to a distinction between " good antisemitism " and " bad antisemitism " . The " bad " kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent . This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity ; anyone could become a Christian . The " good " kind criticized alleged Jewish conspiracies to control newspapers , banks , and other institutions , to care only about accumulation of wealth , etc .
The value judgement definition of literature considers it to exclusively include writing that possesses high quality or distinction , forming part of the so-called belles-lettres ( 'fine writing ' ) tradition . This is the definition used in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition ( 1910–11 ) when it classifies literature as " the best expression of the best thought reduced to writing . " However , this has the result that there is no objective definition of what constitutes " literature " ; anything can be literature , and anything which is universally regarded as literature has the potential to be excluded , since value-judgements can change over time .
The oldest rocks in the group are in the north west of Scotland , Ireland and North Wales and are 2,700 million years old . During the Silurian period the north-western regions collided with the south-east , which had been part of a separate continental landmass . The topography of the islands is modest in scale by global standards . Ben Nevis rises to an elevation of only 1,344 metres ( 4,409 ft ) , and Lough Neagh , which is notably larger than other lakes on the isles , covers 390 square kilometres ( 151 sq mi ) . The climate is temperate marine , with mild winters and warm summers . The North Atlantic Drift brings significant moisture and raises temperatures 11 °C ( 20 °F ) above the global average for the latitude . This led to a landscape which was long dominated by temperate rainforest , although human activity has since cleared the vast majority of forest cover . The region was re-inhabited after the last glacial period of Quaternary glaciation , by 12,000 BC when Great Britain was still a peninsula of the European continent . Ireland , which became an island by 12,000 BC , was not inhabited until after 8000 BC . Great Britain became an island by 5600 BC .
The term Hokkien ( 福建 ; hɔk˥˥kɪɛn˨˩ ) is itself a term not used in Chinese to refer to the dialect , as it simply means Fujian province . In Chinese linguistics , these dialects are known by their classification under the Quanzhang Division ( Chinese : 泉漳片 ; pinyin : Quánzhāng piàn ) of Min Nan , which comes from the first characters of the two main Hokkien urban centers Quanzhou and Zhangzhou . The variety is also known by other terms such as the more general Min Nan ( traditional Chinese : 閩南語 , 閩南話 ; simplified Chinese : 闽南语 , 闽南话 ; pinyin : Mǐnnányǔ , Mǐnnánhuà ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : Bân-lâm-gí , Bân-lâm-oē ) or Southern Min , and Fulaohua ( traditional Chinese : 福佬話 ; simplified Chinese : 福佬话 ; pinyin : Fúlǎohuà ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : Hō-ló-oē ) . The term Hokkien ( Chinese : 福建話 ; Pe̍h-ōe-jī : hok-kiàn oē ; Tâi-lô : Hok-kiàn-uē ) , on the other hand , is used commonly in South East Asia to refer to Min-nan dialects .
The CD was planned to be the successor of the gramophone record for playing music , rather than primarily as a data storage medium . From its origins as a musical format , CDs have grown to encompass other applications . In 1983 , following the CD 's introduction , Immink and Braat presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd AES Convention . In June 1985 , the computer-readable CD-ROM ( read-only memory ) and , in 1990 , CD-Recordable were introduced , also developed by both Sony and Philips . Recordable CDs were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods . Other newer video formats such as DVD and Blu-ray use the same physical geometry as CD , and most DVD and Blu-ray players are backward compatible with audio CD .
Victoria wrote to her uncle Leopold , whom Victoria considered her " best and kindest adviser " , to thank him " for the prospect of great happiness you have contributed to give me , in the person of dear Albert ... He possesses every quality that could be desired to render me perfectly happy . He is so sensible , so kind , and so good , and so amiable too . He has besides the most pleasing and delightful exterior and appearance you can possibly see . " However at 17 , Victoria , though interested in Albert , was not yet ready to marry . The parties did not undertake a formal engagement , but assumed that the match would take place in due time .
Though the iPod was released in 2001 , its price and Mac-only compatibility caused sales to be relatively slow until 2004 . The iPod line came from Apple 's " digital hub " category , when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices . Digital cameras , camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets , but the company found existing digital music players " big and clunky or small and useless " with user interfaces that were " unbelievably awful , " so Apple decided to develop its own . As ordered by CEO Steve Jobs , Apple 's hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line , including hardware engineers Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey , and design engineer Sir Jonathan Ive . Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba disk drive when meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan , and purchased the rights to it for Apple , and had also already worked out how the screen , battery , and other key elements would work . The aesthetic was inspired by the 1958 Braun T3 transistor radio designed by Dieter Rams , while the wheel based user interface was prompted by Bang & Olufsen 's BeoCom 6000 telephone . The product ( " the Walkman of the twenty-first century " ) was developed in less than one year and unveiled on October 23 , 2001 . Jobs announced it as a Mac-compatible product with a 5 GB hard drive that put " 1,000 songs in your pocket . "
On 25 January 1952 , a confrontation between British forces and police at Ismailia resulted in the deaths of 40 Egyptian policemen , provoking riots in Cairo the next day which left 76 people dead . Afterwards , Nasser published a simple six-point program in Rose al-Yūsuf to dismantle feudalism and British influence in Egypt . In May , Nasser received word that Farouk knew the names of the Free Officers and intended to arrest them ; he immediately entrusted Free Officer Zakaria Mohieddin with the task of planning the government takeover by army units loyal to the association .
Electricity in the Richmond Metro area is provided by Dominion Virginia Power . The company , based in Richmond , is one of the nation 's largest producers of energy , serving retail energy customers in nine states . Electricity is provided in the Richmond area primarily by the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station and Surry Nuclear Generating Station , as well as a coal-fired station in Chester , Virginia . These three plants provide a total of 4,453 megawatts of power . Several other natural gas plants provide extra power during times of peak demand . These include facilities in Chester , and Surry , and two plants in Richmond ( Gravel Neck and Darbytown ) .
Season three premiered on January 19 , 2004 . One of the most talked-about contestants during the audition process was William Hung whose off-key rendition of Ricky Martin 's " She Bangs " received widespread attention . His exposure on Idol landed him a record deal and surprisingly he became the third best-selling singer from that season .
Insects ( from Latin insectum , a calque of Greek ἔντομον [ éntomon ] , " cut into sections " ) are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton , a three-part body ( head , thorax and abdomen ) , three pairs of jointed legs , compound eyes and one pair of antennae . They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet , including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms . The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million , and potentially represent over 90 % of the differing animal life forms on Earth . Insects may be found in nearly all environments , although only a small number of species reside in the oceans , a habitat dominated by another arthropod group , crustaceans .
UNFPA works in partnership with governments , along with other United Nations agencies , communities , NGOs , foundations and the private sector , to raise awareness and mobilize the support and resources needed to achieve its mission to promote the rights and health of women and young people .
Located in the American South , Houston is a diverse city with a large and growing international community . The metropolitan area is home to an estimated 1.1 million ( 21.4 percent ) residents who were born outside the United States , with nearly two-thirds of the area 's foreign-born population from south of the United States–Mexico border . Additionally , more than one in five foreign-born residents are from Asia . The city is home to the nation 's third-largest concentration of consular offices , representing 86 countries .
Originally based on the English alphabet , ASCII encodes 128 specified characters into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart on the right . The characters encoded are numbers 0 to 9 , lowercase letters a to z , uppercase letters A to Z , basic punctuation symbols , control codes that originated with Teletype machines , and a space . For example , lowercase j would become binary 1101010 and decimal 106 . ASCII includes definitions for 128 characters : 33 are non-printing control characters ( many now obsolete ) that affect how text and space are processed and 95 printable characters , including the space ( which is considered an invisible graphic:223 ) .
At 36,125 square kilometres ( 13,948 sq mi ) , the country is larger in size than Taiwan or Belgium . It lies at a low altitude ; its highest point is 300 metres ( 984 ft ) . The terrain of is mostly low coastal plain with swamps of Guinean mangroves rising to Guinean forest-savanna mosaic in the east . Its monsoon-like rainy season alternates with periods of hot , dry harmattan winds blowing from the Sahara . The Bijagos Archipelago lies off of the mainland .
In the 1980s , mixed tag team matches began to take place , with a male and female on each team and a rule stating that each wrestler could only attack the opponent of the same gender . If a tag was made , the other team had to automatically switch their legal wrestler as well . Despite these restrictions , many mixed tag matches do feature some physical interaction between participants of different genders . For example , a heel may take a cheap shot at the female wrestler of the opposing team to draw a negative crowd reaction . In lucha libre , cheap-shots and male-female attacks are not uncommon .
The cantons have a permanent constitutional status and , in comparison with the situation in other countries , a high degree of independence . Under the Federal Constitution , all 26 cantons are equal in status . Each canton has its own constitution , and its own parliament , government and courts . However , there are considerable differences between the individual cantons , most particularly in terms of population and geographical area . Their populations vary between 15,000 ( Appenzell Innerrhoden ) and 1,253,500 ( Zürich ) , and their area between 37 km2 ( 14 sq mi ) ( Basel-Stadt ) and 7,105 km2 ( 2,743 sq mi ) ( Graubünden ) . The Cantons comprise a total of 2,485 municipalities . Within Switzerland there are two enclaves : Büsingen belongs to Germany , Campione d'Italia belongs to Italy .
Thomas J. Watson , Sr. , fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson , called on Flint and , in 1914 , was offered CTR . Watson joined CTR as General Manager then , 11 months later , was made President when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved . Having learned Patterson 's pioneering business practices , Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR 's companies . He implemented sales conventions , " generous sales incentives , a focus on customer service , an insistence on well-groomed , dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker " . His favorite slogan , " THINK " , became a mantra for each company 's employees . During Watson 's first four years , revenues more than doubled to $ 9 million and the company 's operations expanded to Europe , South America , Asia and Australia . " Watson had never liked the clumsy hyphenated title of the CTR " and chose to replace it with the more expansive title " International Business Machines " . First as a name for a 1917 Canadian subsidiary , then as a line in advertisements . For example , the McClures magazine , v53 , May 1921 , has a full page ad with , at the bottom :
In the midst of the European sovereign-debt crisis , Radek Sikorski , Poland 's Foreign Minister , stated in November 2011 , " I will probably be the first Polish foreign minister in history to say so , but here it is : I fear German power less than I am beginning to fear German inactivity . You have become Europe 's indispensable nation . " According to Jacob Heilbrunn , a senior editor at The National Interest , such a statement is unprecedented when taking into consideration Germany 's history . " This was an extraordinary statement from a top official of a nation that was ravaged by Germany during World War II . And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin 's position at the center of the Continent . " Heilbrunn believes that the adage , " what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union " has been supplanted by a new mentality—what is in the interest of Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors . The evolution in Germany 's national identity stems from focusing less on its Nazi past and more on its Prussian history , which many Germans believe was betrayed—and not represented—by Nazism . The evolution is further precipitated by Germany 's conspicuous position as Europe 's strongest economy . Indeed , this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it , as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski 's effusive praise for his country 's western neighbor . This shift in thinking is boosted by a newer generation of Germans who see World War II as a distant memory .
The constraints of constructing a flight deck affect the role of a given carrier strongly , as they influence the weight , type , and configuration of the aircraft that may be launched . For example , assisted launch mechanisms are used primarily for heavy aircraft , especially those loaded with air-to-ground weapons . CATOBAR is most commonly used on USN supercarriers as it allows the deployment of heavy jets with full loadouts , especially on ground-attack missions . STOVL is used by other navies because it is cheaper to operate and still provides good deployment capability for fighter aircraft .
In the early 21st century , Republican voters control most of the state , especially in the more rural and suburban areas outside of the cities ; Democratic strength is mostly confined to the urban cores of the four major cities , and is particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis . The latter area includes a large African-American population . Historically , Republicans had their greatest strength in East Tennessee before the 1960s . Tennessee 's 1st and 2nd congressional districts , based in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville , respectively , are among the few historically Republican districts in the South . Those districts ' residents supported the Union over the Confederacy during the Civil War ; they identified with the GOP after the war and have stayed with that party ever since . The 1st has been in Republican hands continuously since 1881 , and Republicans ( or their antecedents ) have held it for all but four years since 1859 . The 2nd has been held continuously by Republicans or their antecedents since 1859 .
Islam is the most widely practised religion in Southeast Asia , numbering approximately 240 million adherents which translate to about 40 % of the entire population , with majorities in Indonesia , Brunei , Malaysia and in Southern Philippines with Indonesia as the largest and most populated Muslim country around the world . Countries in Southeast Asia practice many different religions . Buddhism is predominant in Thailand , Cambodia , Laos , Burma , Vietnam and Singapore . Ancestor worship and Confucianism are also widely practised in Vietnam and Singapore . Christianity is predominant in the Philippines , eastern Indonesia , East Malaysia and East Timor . The Philippines has the largest Roman Catholic population in Asia . East Timor is also predominantly Roman Catholic due to a history of Portuguese rule .
Anthropology is the study of humans and their societies in the past and present . Its main subdivisions are social anthropology and cultural anthropology , which describes the workings of societies around the world , linguistic anthropology , which investigates the influence of language in social life , and biological or physical anthropology , which concerns long-term development of the human organism . Archaeology , which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence , is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States , while in Europe , it is viewed as a discipline in its own right , or grouped under other related disciplines such as history .
One of the characteristics of BYU most often pointed out is its reputation for emphasizing a " marriage culture " . Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints highly value marriage and family , especially marriage within the faith . Approximately 51 percent of the graduates in BYU 's class of 2005 were married . This is compared to a national marriage average among college graduates of 11 percent . BYU students on average marry at the age of 22 , according to a 2005 study , while the national average age is 25 years for men and 27 years for women .
Common energy forms include the kinetic energy of a moving object , the potential energy stored by an object 's position in a force field ( gravitational , electric or magnetic ) , the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects , the chemical energy released when a fuel burns , the radiant energy carried by light , and the thermal energy due to an object 's temperature . All of the many forms of energy are convertible to other kinds of energy . In Newtonian physics , there is a universal law of conservation of energy which says that energy can be neither created nor be destroyed ; however , it can change from one form to another .
Defining exactly what section of a DNA sequence comprises a gene is difficult . Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have to be close to the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity . Similarly , a gene 's introns can be much larger than its exons . Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome .
Between 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941 , 16 British cities suffered aerial raids with at least 100 long tons of high explosives . Over a period of 267 days , London was attacked 71 times , Birmingham , Liverpool and Plymouth eight times , Bristol six , Glasgow five , Southampton four , Portsmouth and Hull three and a minimum of one large raid on eight other cities . This was a result of a rapid escalation starting on 24 August 1940 , when night bombers aiming for RAF airfields drifted off course and accidentally destroyed several London homes , killing civilians , combined with the UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill 's retaliatory bombing of Berlin on the following night . [ clarification needed ]
Mexico city primarily rests on what was Lake Texcoco . Seismic activity is frequent here . Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century . Although none of the lake waters remain , the city rests on the lake bed 's heavily saturated clay . This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater , called groundwater-related subsidence . Since the beginning of the 20th century the city has sunk as much as nine metres ( 30 feet ) in some areas . This sinking is causing problems with runoff and wastewater management , leading to flooding problems , especially during the rainy season . The entire lake bed is now paved over and most of the city 's remaining forested areas lie in the southern boroughs of Milpa Alta , Tlalpan and Xochimilco .
The Śātavāhana Empire was a royal Indian dynasty based from Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh as well as Junnar ( Pune ) and Prathisthan ( Paithan ) in Maharashtra . The territory of the empire covered much of India from 230 BCE onward . Sātavāhanas started out as feudatories to the Mauryan dynasty , but declared independence with its decline . They are known for their patronage of Hinduism and Buddhism which resulted in Buddhist monuments from Ellora ( a UNESCO World Heritage Site ) to Amaravati . The Sātavāhanas were one of the first Indian states to issue coins struck with their rulers embossed . They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade as well as the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the southern tip of India . They had to compete with the Shunga Empire and then the Kanva dynasty of Magadha to establish their rule . Later , they played a crucial role to protect a huge part of India against foreign invaders like the Sakas , Yavanas and Pahlavas . In particular their struggles with the Western Kshatrapas went on for a long time . The notable rulers of the Satavahana Dynasty Gautamiputra Satakarni and Sri Yajna Sātakarni were able to defeat the foreign invaders like the Western Kshatrapas and to stop their expansion . In the 3rd century CE the empire was split into smaller states .
Commercial CSP plants were first developed in the 1980s . Since 1985 the eventually 354 MW SEGS CSP installation , in the Mojave Desert of California , is the largest solar power plant in the world . Other large CSP plants include the 150 MW Solnova Solar Power Station and the 100 MW Andasol solar power station , both in Spain . The 250 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project , in the United States , and the 221 MW Charanka Solar Park in India , are the world’s largest photovoltaic plants . Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed , but most of the deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5 kW , which are grid connected using net metering and/or a feed-in tariff . In 2013 solar generated less than 1 % of the worlds total grid electricity .
Ajahn Sucitto describes the path as " a mandala of interconnected factors that support and moderate each other . " The eight factors of the path are not to be understood as stages , in which each stage is completed before moving on to the next . Rather , they are understood as eight significant dimensions of one 's behaviour—mental , spoken , and bodily—that operate in dependence on one another ; taken together , they define a complete path , or way of living .
In response to organized crime , on August 25 , 1953 , the FBI created the Top Hoodlum Program . The national office directed field offices to gather information on mobsters in their territories and to report it regularly to Washington for a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers . After the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act , or RICO Act , took effect , the FBI began investigating the former Prohibition-organized groups , which had become fronts for crime in major cities and small towns . All of the FBI work was done undercover and from within these organizations , using the provisions provided in the RICO Act . Gradually the agency dismantled many of the groups . Although Hoover initially denied the existence of a National Crime Syndicate in the United States , the Bureau later conducted operations against known organized crime syndicates and families , including those headed by Sam Giancana and John Gotti . The RICO Act is still used today for all organized crime and any individuals who might fall under the Act .
The monogram theme was developed into an Art Deco-style badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F , the whole set within a hexagonal border . This early example of a corporate logo , introduced as part of Herbert Chapman 's rebranding of the club in the 1930s , was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium , including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors . From 1967 , a white cannon was regularly worn on the shirts , until replaced by the club crest , sometimes with the addition of the nickname " The Gunners " , in the 1990s .
Despite the initial negative press , several websites have given the system very good reviews mostly regarding its hardware . CNET United Kingdom praised the system saying , " the PS3 is a versatile and impressive piece of home-entertainment equipment that lives up to the hype [ ... ] the PS3 is well worth its hefty price tag . " CNET awarded it a score of 8.8 out of 10 and voted it as its number one " must-have " gadget , praising its robust graphical capabilities and stylish exterior design while criticizing its limited selection of available games . In addition , both Home Theater Magazine and Ultimate AV have given the system 's Blu-ray playback very favorable reviews , stating that the quality of playback exceeds that of many current standalone Blu-ray Disc players .
Twins ( 1988 ) , a comedy with Danny DeVito , also proved successful . Total Recall ( 1990 ) netted Schwarzenegger $ 10 million and 15 % of the film 's gross . A science fiction script , the film was based on the Philip K. Dick short story " We Can Remember It for You Wholesale " . Kindergarten Cop ( 1990 ) reunited him with director Ivan Reitman , who directed him in Twins . Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing , first with a 1990 episode of the TV series Tales from the Crypt , entitled " The Switch " , and then with the 1992 telemovie Christmas in Connecticut . He has not directed since .
A climbing elevator is a self-ascending elevator with its own propulsion . The propulsion can be done by an electric or a combustion engine . Climbing elevators are used in guyed masts or towers , in order to make easy access to parts of these constructions , such as flight safety lamps for maintenance . An example would be the Moonlight towers in Austin , Texas , where the elevator holds only one person and equipment for maintenance . The Glasgow Tower — an observation tower in Glasgow , Scotland — also makes use of two climbing elevators .
In 2004 , SME and Bertelsmann Music Group merged as Sony BMG Music Entertainment . When Sony acquired BMG 's half of the conglomerate in 2008 , Sony BMG reverted to the SME name . The buyout led to the dissolution of BMG , which then relaunched as BMG Rights Management . Out of the " Big Three " record companies , with Universal Music Group being the largest and Warner Music Group , SME is middle-sized .
In 1870 , following the stunning defeat of the French Army by the Germans in the Franco-Prussian War , French workers and socialist revolutionaries seized Paris and created the Paris Commune . The Commune lasted for two months before it was crushed by the French Army , with much bloodshed . The original red banners of the Commune became icons of the socialist revolution ; in 1921 members of the French Communist Party came to Moscow and presented the new Soviet government with one of the original Commune banners ; it was placed ( and is still in place ) in the tomb of Vladimir Lenin , next to his open coffin .
The oldest method of studying the brain is anatomical , and until the middle of the 20th century , much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes . Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components , especially synapses . Among other tools , they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure , chemistry , and connectivity . In recent years , the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes . Also , functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior .
Specification-based testing aims to test the functionality of software according to the applicable requirements . This level of testing usually requires thorough test cases to be provided to the tester , who then can simply verify that for a given input , the output value ( or behavior ) , either " is " or " is not " the same as the expected value specified in the test case . Test cases are built around specifications and requirements , i.e. , what the application is supposed to do . It uses external descriptions of the software , including specifications , requirements , and designs to derive test cases . These tests can be functional or non-functional , though usually functional .
Pope John XXIII offered to mediate between US President John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 . Both men applauded the pope for his deep commitment to peace . Khrushchev would later send a message via Norman Cousins and the letter expressed his best wishes for the pontiff 's ailing health . John XXIII personally typed and sent a message back to him , thanking him for his letter . Cousins , meanwhile , travelled to New York City and ensured that John would become Time magazine 's 'Man of the Year ' . John XXIII became the first Pope to receive the title , followed by John Paul II in 1994 and Francis in 2013 .
Darwin continued to research and extensively revise his theory while focusing on his main work of publishing the scientific results of the Beagle voyage . He tentatively wrote of his ideas to Lyell in January 1842 ; then in June he roughed out a 35-page " Pencil Sketch " of his theory . Darwin began correspondence about his theorising with the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker in January 1844 , and by July had rounded out his " sketch " into a 230-page " Essay " , to be expanded with his research results and published if he died prematurely .
The work of children was important in pre-industrial societies , as children needed to provide their labour for their survival and that of their group . Pre-industrial societies were characterised by low productivity and short life expectancy , preventing children from participating in productive work would be more harmful to their welfare and that of their group in the long run . In pre-industrial societies , there was little need for children to attend school . This is especially the case in non literate societies . Most pre-industrial skill and knowledge were amenable to being passed down through direct mentoring or apprenticing by competent adults .
In mid 2011 , the Foundation announced in its new " Water , Sanitation , Hygiene Strategy Overview " that its funding now focuses primarily on sanitation , particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia , because access to improved sanitation is lowest in those regions . Their grant-making focus has been since 2011 on sanitation science and technology ( " transformative technologies " ) , delivery models at scale , urban sanitation markets , building demand for sanitation , measurement and evaluation as well as policy , advocacy and communications .
Although the Spanish Empire had a residual claim on the Marshalls in 1874 , when she began asserting her sovereignty over the Carolines , she made no effort to prevent the German Empire from gaining a foothold there . Britain also raised no objection to a German protectorate over the Marshalls in exchange for German recognition of Britain 's rights in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands . On October 13 , 1885 , SMS Nautilus under Captain Rötger brought German emissaries to Jaluit . They signed a treaty with Kabua , whom the Germans had earlier recognized as " King of the Ralik Islands , " on October 15 .
On December 8 , the leaders of Russia , Ukraine , and Belarus secretly met in Belavezhskaya Pushcha , in western Belarus , and signed the Belavezha Accords , which proclaimed the Soviet Union had ceased to exist and announced formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) as a looser association to take its place . They also invited other republics to join the CIS . Gorbachev called it an unconstitutional coup . However , by this time there was no longer any reasonable doubt that , as the preamble of the Accords put it , " the USSR , as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality , is ceasing its existence . "
In May 1985 , Gorbachev delivered a speech in Leningrad advocating reforms and an anti-alcohol campaign to tackle widespread alcoholism . Prices on vodka , wine , and beer were raised in order to make these drinks more expensive and a disincentive to consumers , and the introduction of rationing . Unlike most forms of rationing intended to conserve scarce goods , this was done to restrict sales with the overt goal of curtailing drunkenness . Gorbachev 's plan also included billboards promoting sobriety , increased penalties for public drunkenness , and to censor drinking scenes from old movies . Although this program was not a direct copycat of Tsar Nicholas II 's outright prohibition during World War I , Gorbachev faced the same adverse economic reaction as did the last Tsar . The disincentivization of alcohol consumption was a serious blow to the state budget according to Alexander Yakovlev , who noted annual collections of alcohol taxes decreased by 100 billion rubles . Alcohol production migrated to the black market , or through moonshining as some made " bathtub vodka " with homegrown potatoes . Poorer , less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes such as nail polish , rubbing alcohol or men 's cologne , which only served to be an additional burden on Russia 's healthcare sector due to the subsequent poisoning cases . The purpose of these reforms , however , was to prop up the existing centrally planned economy , unlike later reforms , which tended toward market socialism .
Spielberg 's next film , Schindler 's List , was based on the true story of Oskar Schindler , a man who risked his life to save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust . Schindler 's List earned Spielberg his first Academy Award for Best Director ( it also won Best Picture ) . With the film a huge success at the box office , Spielberg used the profits to set up the Shoah Foundation , a non-profit organization that archives filmed testimony of Holocaust survivors . In 1997 , the American Film Institute listed it among the 10 Greatest American Films ever Made ( # 9 ) which moved up to ( # 8 ) when the list was remade in 2007 .
Since the Spanish transition to democracy ( 1975–1982 ) , Catalan has been recognized as an official language , language of education , and language of mass media , all of which have contributed to its increased prestige . There is no parallel in Europe of such a large , bilingual , non-state speech community .
The restoration of power to the patriciate was only temporary . After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes such as the Züriputsch of 1839 , civil war ( the Sonderbundskrieg ) broke out in 1847 when some Catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance ( the Sonderbund ) . The war lasted for less than a month , causing fewer than 100 casualties , most of which were through friendly fire . Yet however minor the Sonderbundskrieg appears compared with other European riots and wars in the 19th century , it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the Swiss and of Switzerland .
In response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players , in 1999 , the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union . A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive 'A ' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years , and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years . If a player does not meet those criteria , the club wishing to sign him may appeal .
The rising population has resulted in an increased demand on fish stocks , which are under stress ; although the creation of the Funafuti Conservation Area has provided a fishing exclusion area to help sustain the fish population across the Funafuti lagoon . Population pressure on the resources of Funafuti and inadequate sanitation systems have resulted in pollution . The Waste Operations and Services Act of 2009 provides the legal framework for waste management and pollution control projects funded by the European Union directed at organic waste composting in eco-sanitation systems . The Environment Protection ( Litter and Waste Control ) Regulation 2013 is intended to improve the management of the importation of non-biodegradable materials . In Tuvalu plastic waste is a problem as much imported food and other commodities are supplied in plastic containers or packaging .
On Thursday , September 15 , 2011 , more than 500 people from Hongxiao Village protested over the large-scale death of fish in a nearby river . Angry protesters stormed the Zhejiang Jinko Solar Company factory compound , overturned eight company vehicles , and destroyed the offices before police came to disperse the crowd . Protests continued on the two following nights with reports of scuffles , officials said . Chen Hongming , a deputy head of Haining 's environmental protection bureau , said the factory 's waste disposal had failed pollution tests since April . The environmental watchdog had warned the factory , but it had not effectively controlled the pollution , Chen added .
After the setback at Aspern-Essling , Napoleon took more than six weeks in planning and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt at crossing the Danube . From 30 June to the early days of July , the French recrossed the Danube in strength , with more than 180,000 troops marching across the Marchfeld towards the Austrians . Charles received the French with 150,000 of his own men . In the ensuing Battle of Wagram , which also lasted two days , Napoleon commanded his forces in what was the largest battle of his career up until then . Neither side made much progress on 5 July , but the 6th produced a definitive outcome . Both sides launched major assaults on their flanks . Austrian attacks against the French left wing looked dangerous initially , but they were all beaten back . Meanwhile , a steady French attack against the Austrian left wing eventually compromised the entire position for Charles . Napoleon finished off the battle with a concentrated central thrust that punctured a hole in the Austrian army and forced Charles to retreat . Austrian losses were very heavy , reaching well over 40,000 casualties . The French were too exhausted to pursue the Austrians immediately , but Napoleon eventually caught up with Charles at Znaim and the latter signed an armistice on 12 July .
On the Indian subcontinent , the Mughal Empire ruled most of India in the early 18th century . The " classic period " ended with the death and defeat of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707 by the rising Hindu Maratha Empire , although the dynasty continued for another 150 years . During this period , the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions . All the significant monuments of the Mughals , their most visible legacy , date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent , with brilliant literary , artistic , and architectural results . The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the Peshwas , the prime ministers of the Maratha empire . In 1761 , the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states .
Most wrestling matches last for a set number of falls , with the first side to achieve the majority number of pinfalls , submissions , or countouts being the winner . Historically , matches were wrestled to 3 falls ( " best 2 out of 3 " ) or 5 falls ( " best 3 out of 5 " ) . The standard for modern matches is one fall . However , even though it is now standard , many announcers will explicitly state this ( e.g . " The following contest is set for one fall with a 20-minute time limit " ) . These matches are given a time limit ; if not enough falls are scored by the end of the time limit , the match is declared a draw . Modern matches are generally given a 10- to 30-minute time limit for standard matches ; title matches can go for up to one hour . British wrestling matches held under Admiral-Lord Mountevans rules are 2 out of 3 falls .
A red dye called Kermes was made beginning in the Neolithic Period by drying and then crushing the bodies of the females of a tiny scale insect in the genus Kermes , primarily Kermes vermilio . The insects live on the sap of certain trees , especially Kermes oak trees near the Mediterranean region . Jars of kermes have been found in a Neolithic cave-burial at Adaoutse , Bouches-du-Rhône . Kermes from oak trees was later used by Romans , who imported it from Spain . A different variety of dye was made from Porphyrophora hamelii ( Armenian cochineal ) scale insects that lived on the roots and stems of certain herbs . It was mentioned in texts as early as the 8th century BC , and it was used by the ancient Assyrians and Persians .
The final decades of the 20th century have seen the rise of a new interdisciplinary approach to studying human psychology , known collectively as cognitive science . Cognitive science again considers the mind as a subject for investigation , using the tools of psychology , linguistics , computer science , philosophy , and neurobiology . New methods of visualizing the activity of the brain , such as PET scans and CAT scans , began to exert their influence as well , leading some researchers to investigate the mind by investigating the brain , rather than cognition . These new forms of investigation assume that a wide understanding of the human mind is possible , and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains , such as artificial intelligence .
It is the third language of South Africa in terms of native speakers ( ~13.5 % ) , of whom 53 percent are Coloureds and 42.4 percent Whites . In 1996 , 40 percent of South Africans reported to know Afrikaans at least at a very basic level of communication . It is the lingua franca in Namibia , where it is spoken natively in 11 percent of households . In total , Afrikaans is the first language in South Africa alone of about 6.8 million people and is estimated to be a second language for at least 10 million people worldwide , compared to over 23 million and 5 million respectively , for Dutch .
Rapid decompression can be much more dangerous than vacuum exposure itself . Even if the victim does not hold his or her breath , venting through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the fatal rupture of the delicate alveoli of the lungs . Eardrums and sinuses may be ruptured by rapid decompression , soft tissues may bruise and seep blood , and the stress of shock will accelerate oxygen consumption leading to hypoxia . Injuries caused by rapid decompression are called barotrauma . A pressure drop of 13 kPa ( 100 Torr ) , which produces no symptoms if it is gradual , may be fatal if it occurs suddenly .
Almost 60 years later , 80 year old career criminal Henry ( Harry ) James Burge claimed to have committed the theft , confessing to a newspaper , with the story being published in the Sunday Pictorial newspaper on 23 February 1958 . He claimed to have carried out the robbery with two other men , although when discrepancies with a contemporaneous report in the Birmingham Post newspaper ( the crime pre-dated written police reports ) in his account of the means of entry and other items stolen , detectives decided there was no realistic possibility of a conviction and the case was closed . Burge claimed the cup had been melted down to make counterfeit half-crown coins , which matched known intelligence of the time , in which stolen silver was being used to forge coins which were then laundered through betting shops at a local racecourse , although Burge had no past history of forgery in a record of 42 previous convictions for which he had spent 42 years in prison . He had been further imprisoned in 1957 for seven years for theft from cars . Released in 1961 , he died in 1964 .
Plymouth is the regional television centre of BBC South West . A team of journalists are headquartered at Plymouth for the ITV West Country regional station , after a merger with ITV West forced ITV Westcountry to close on 16 February 2009 . The main local newspapers serving Plymouth are The Herald and Western Morning News with Radio Plymouth , BBC Radio Devon , Heart South West , and Pirate FM being the main local radio stations .
Most Venezuelans have some indigenous heritage , but the indigenous population make up only around 2 % of the total population . They speak around 29 different languages and many more dialects , but some of the ethnic groups are very small and their languages are in danger of becoming extinct in the next decades . The most important indigenous groups are the Ye'kuana , the Wayuu , the Pemon and the Warao . The most advanced native people to have lived in present-day Venezuela is thought to have been the Timoto-cuicas , who mainly lived in the Venezuelan Andes . In total it is estimated that there were between 350 thousand and 500 thousand inhabitants , the most densely populated area being the Andean region ( Timoto-cuicas ) , thanks to the advanced agricultural techniques used .
Gautama first went to study with famous religious teachers of the day , and mastered the meditative attainments they taught . But he found that they did not provide a permanent end to suffering , so he continued his quest . He next attempted an extreme asceticism , which was a religious pursuit common among the śramaṇas , a religious culture distinct from the Vedic one . Gautama underwent prolonged fasting , breath-holding , and exposure to pain . He almost starved himself to death in the process . He realized that he had taken this kind of practice to its limit , and had not put an end to suffering . So in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach . He devoted himself to anapanasati meditation , through which he discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way ( Skt . madhyamā-pratipad ) : a path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification .

The slowing sales growth has been attributed to the maturing PC market , which constituted 66 % of Dell 's sales , and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage , services and servers . Dell 's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs , but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company 's supply chain , and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell , weakening Dell 's traditional price differentiation . Throughout the entire PC industry , declines in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers ( a lucrative strategy of encouraging buyers to upgrade the processor or memory ) . As a result , the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before , which eroded profit margins . The laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the PC market , but Dell produced low-cost notebooks in China like other PC manufacturers which eliminated Dell 's manufacturing cost advantages , plus Dell 's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores . CNET has suggested that Dell was getting trapped in the increasing commoditization of high volume low margin computers , which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded .
The main party leaders , David Cameron , Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband , were all depicted holding a copy of the special issue in publicity material . Miliband 's decision to pose with a copy of The Sun received a strong response . Organisations representing the relatives of Hillsborough victims described Miliband 's action as an " absolute disgrace " and he faced criticism too from Liverpool Labour MPs and the city 's Labour Mayor , Joe Anderson . A statement was issued on 13 June explaining that Miliband " was promoting England 's bid to win the World Cup " , although " he understands the anger that is felt towards the Sun over Hillsborough by many people in Merseyside and he is sorry to those who feel offended . "
The Late Triassic spans from 237 million to 200 million years ago . Following the bloom of the Middle Triassic , the Late Triassic featured frequent heat spells , as well as moderate precipitation ( 10-20 inches per year ) . The recent warming led to a boom of reptilian evolution on land as the first true dinosaurs evolve , as well as pterosaurs . All this climatic change , however , resulted in a large die-out known as the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event , in which all archosaurs ( excluding ancient crocodiles ) , most synapsids , and almost all large amphibians went extinct , as well as 34 % of marine life in the fourth mass extinction event of the world . The cause is debatable .
Hidalgo is hailed as the Father of the Nation even though it was Agustin de Iturbide and not Hidalgo who achieved Mexican Independence in 1821 . Shortly after gaining independence , the day to celebrate it varied between September 16 , the day of Hidalgo 's Grito , and September 27 , the day Iturbide rode into Mexico City to end the war . Later , political movements would favor the more liberal Hidalgo over the conservative Iturbide , so that eventually September 16 , 1810 became the officially recognized day of Mexican independence . The reason for this is that Hidalgo is considered to be " precursor and creator of the rest of the heroes of the ( Mexican War of ) Independence . " Hidalgo has become an icon for Mexicans who resist tyranny in the country . Diego Rivera painted Hidalgo 's image in half a dozen murals . José Clemente Orozco depicted him with a flaming torch of liberty and considered the painting among his best work . David Alfaro Siqueiros was commissioned by San Nicolas University in Morelia to paint a mural for a celebration commemorating the 200th anniversary of Hidalgo 's birth . The town of his parish was renamed Dolores Hidalgo in his honor and the state of Hidalgo was created in 1869 . Every year on the night of 15–16 September , the president of Mexico re-enacts the Grito from the balcony of the National Palace . This scene is repeated by the heads of cities and towns all over Mexico . The remains of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla lie in the column of the Angel of Independence in Mexico City . Next to it is a lamp lit to represent the sacrifice of those who gave their lives for Mexican Independence .
The term samurai originally meant " those who serve in close attendance to nobility " , and was written with a Chinese character ( or kanji ) that had the same meaning . In Japanese , it was originally recorded in the Nara Period as a verb *samorapu ( " to watch , to keep watch , to observe , to be on the lookout for something ; to serve , to attend " ) , which is believed to be derived from the frequentative form ( *morapu 守らふ ) of the verb moru ( 守る , " to watch , to guard , to be on the lookout ; to keep , to protect , to take care of , to be in charge of , to have as one 's ward " ) . By the Heian period , this word had developed into the verb saburahu ( さぶらふ , " to serve , to attend " ) , from which a deverbal noun saburahi ( さぶらひ , " servant , attendant " ) was later derived , and this noun then yielded samurahi ( さむらひ ) in the Edo period . In Japanese literature , there is an early reference to samurai in the Kokinshū ( 古今集 , early 10th century ) :
St. Patrick 's Street , the main street of the city which was remodelled in the mid-2000s , is known for the architecture of the buildings along its pedestrian-friendly route and is the main shopping thoroughfare . The reason for its curved shape is that it originally was a channel of the River Lee that was built over on arches . The General Post Office , with its limestone façade , is on Oliver Plunkett Street , on the site of the Theatre Royal which was built in 1760 and burned down in 1840 . The English circus proprietor Pablo Fanque rebuilt an amphitheatre on the spot in 1850 , which was subsequently transformed into a theatre and then into the present General Post Office in 1877 . The Grand Parade is a tree-lined avenue , home to offices , shops and financial institutions . The old financial centre is the South Mall , with several banks whose interior derive from the 19th century , such as the Allied Irish Bank 's which was once an exchange .
Integral to the story of the origin of the name " Antarctica " is how it was not named Terra Australis—this name was given to Australia instead , and it was because of a mistake made by people who decided that a significant landmass would not be found farther south than Australia . Explorer Matthew Flinders , in particular , has been credited with popularizing the transfer of the name Terra Australis to Australia . He justified the titling of his book A Voyage to Terra Australis ( 1814 ) by writing in the introduction :
While Old Czech had a basic alphabet from which a general set of orthographical correspondences was drawn , it did not have a standard orthography . It also contained a number of sound clusters which no longer exist ; allowing ě ( /jɛ/ ) after soft consonants , which has since shifted to e ( /ɛ/ ) , and allowing complex consonant clusters to be pronounced all at once rather than syllabically . A phonological phenomenon , Havlik 's law ( which began in Proto-Slavic and took various forms in other Slavic languages ) , appeared in Old Czech ; counting backwards from the end of a clause , every odd-numbered yer was vocalized as a vowel , while the other yers disappeared .
Studies of nutritional status must take into account the state of the body before and after experiments , as well as the chemical composition of the whole diet and of all material excreted and eliminated from the body ( in urine and feces ) . Comparing the food to the waste can help determine the specific compounds and elements absorbed and metabolized in the body . The effects of nutrients may only be discernible over an extended period , during which all food and waste must be analyzed . The number of variables involved in such experiments is high , making nutritional studies time-consuming and expensive , which explains why the science of animal nutrition is still slowly evolving .
In European history , the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : Antiquity , Medieval period , and Modern period . The Medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , the High , and the Late Middle Ages .
It is widely assumed that architectural success was the product of a process of trial and error , with progressively less trial and more replication as the results of the process proved increasingly satisfactory . What is termed vernacular architecture continues to be produced in many parts of the world . Indeed , vernacular buildings make up most of the built world that people experience every day . Early human settlements were mostly rural . Due to a surplus in production the economy began to expand resulting in urbanization thus creating urban areas which grew and evolved very rapidly in some cases , such as that of Çatal Höyük in Anatolia and Mohenjo Daro of the Indus Valley Civilization in modern-day Pakistan .
In 2002 , IBM acquired PwC consulting . In 2003 it initiated a project to redefine company values . Using its Jam technology , it hosted a three-day Internet-based online discussion of key business issues with 50,000 employees . Results were data mined with sophisticated text analysis software ( eClassifier ) for common themes . Three emerged , expressed as : " Dedication to every client 's success " , " Innovation that matters—for our company and for the world " , and " Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships " . Another three-day Jam took place in 2004 , with 52,000 employees discussing ways to implement company values in practice .
In the classical music domain , Portugal is represented by names as the pianists Artur Pizarro , Maria João Pires , Sequeira Costa , the violinists Carlos Damas , Gerardo Ribeiro and in the past by the great cellist Guilhermina Suggia . Notable composers include José Vianna da Motta , Carlos Seixas , João Domingos Bomtempo , João de Sousa Carvalho , Luís de Freitas Branco and his student Joly Braga Santos , Fernando Lopes-Graça , Emmanuel Nunes and Sérgio Azevedo . Similarly , contemporary composers such as Nuno Malo and Miguel d'Oliveira have achieved some international success writing original music for film and television .
By mid-November 1940 , when the Germans adopted a changed plan , more than 13,000 short tons ( 12,000 t ) of high explosive and nearly 1,000,000 incendiaries had fallen on London . Outside the capital , there had been widespread harassing activity by single aircraft , as well as fairly strong diversionary attacks on Birmingham , Coventry and Liverpool , but no major raids . The London docks and railways communications had taken a heavy pounding , and much damage had been done to the railway system outside . In September , there had been no less than 667 hits on railways in Great Britain , and at one period , between 5,000 and 6,000 wagons were standing idle from the effect of delayed action bombs . But the great bulk of the traffic went on ; and Londoners—though they glanced apprehensively each morning at the list of closed stretches of line displayed at their local station , or made strange detours round back streets in the buses—still got to work . For all the destruction of life and property , the observers sent out by the Ministry of Home Security failed to discover the slightest sign of a break in morale . More than 13,000 civilians had been killed , and almost 20,000 injured , in September and October alone , but the death toll was much less than expected . In late 1940 , Churchill credited the shelters :
In Dutch itself , Diets went out of common use - although Platdiets is still used for the transitional Limburgish-Ripuarian dialects in the north-east of Belgium . Nederlands , the official Dutch word for " Dutch " , did not become firmly established until the 19th century . This designation had been in use as far back as the end of the 15th century , but received competition from the more popular terminology Nederduits , " Low Dutch " , for several reasons . One of them was it reflected a distinction with Hoogduits , " High Dutch " , meaning the language spoken in Germany . The Hoog was later dropped , and thus , Duits narrowed down in meaning to refer to the German language .
1 STOBAR carrier : Admiral Flota Sovetskovo Soyuza Kuznetsov : 55,000 tonne Admiral Kuznetsov-class STOBAR aircraft carrier . Launched in 1985 as Tbilisi , renamed and operational from 1995 . Without catapults she can launch and recover lightly fueled naval fighters for air defense or anti-ship missions but not heavy conventional bombing strikes . [ citation needed ] Officially designated an aircraft carrying cruiser , she is unique in carrying a heavy cruiser 's complement of defensive weapons and large P-700 Granit offensive missiles . The P-700 systems will be removed in the coming refit to enlarge her below decks aviation facilities as well as upgrading her defensive systems .
In 1838 the situation was slightly the same as in 1831 . Muhammad Ali of Egypt was not happy about lack of his control and power in Syria , he resumed military actions . The Ottoman army lost to Egyptians at the Battle of Nezib on June 24 , 1839 . The Ottoman Empire was saved by Great Britain , Austria , Prussia and Russia by signing a convention in London in July 15 , 1840 to grant Muhammad Ali and his descendants the right to inherit power in Egypt in exchange for removal of Egyptian military forces from Syria and Lebanon . Moreover , Muhammad Ali had to admit a formal dependence from the Ottoman sultan . After Muhammad Ali refused to obey the requirements of the London convention , the allied Anglo-Austrian fleet blocked the Delta , bombarded Beirut and captured Acre . Muhammad Ali accepted the conditions of the London convention in 1840 .
By 1 October 1950 , the UN Command repelled the KPA northwards past the 38th parallel ; the ROK Army crossed after them , into North Korea . MacArthur made a statement demanding the KPA 's unconditional surrender . Six days later , on 7 October , with UN authorization , the UN Command forces followed the ROK forces northwards . The X Corps landed at Wonsan ( in southeastern North Korea ) and Riwon ( in northeastern North Korea ) , already captured by ROK forces . The Eighth U.S. Army and the ROK Army drove up western Korea and captured Pyongyang city , the North Korean capital , on 19 October 1950 . The 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team ( " Rakkasans " ) made their first of two combat jumps during the Korean War on 20 October 1950 at Sunchon and Sukchon . The missions of the 187th were to cut the road north going to China , preventing North Korean leaders from escaping from Pyongyang ; and to rescue American prisoners of war . At month 's end , UN forces held 135,000 KPA prisoners of war . As they neared the Sino-Korean border , the UN forces in the west were divided from those in the east by 50–100 miles of mountainous terrain .
Hong Kong : The event was held in Hong Kong on May 2 . In the ceremony held at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui , Chief Executive Donald Tsang handed the torch to the first torchbearer , Olympic medalist Lee Lai Shan . The torch relay then traveled through Nathan Road , Lantau Link , Sha Tin ( crossed Shing Mun River via a dragon boat , which had been never used before in the history of Olympic torch relays ) , Victoria Harbour ( crossed by Tin Hau , a VIP vessel managed by the Marine Department ) before ending in Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai . A total of 120 torchbearers were selected to participate in the event consisting of celebrities , athletes and pro-Beijing camp politicians . No politicians from the pro-democracy camp were selected as torchbearers . One torchbearer could not participate due to flight delay . It was estimated that more than 200,000 spectators came out and watched the relay . Many enthusiastic supporters wore red shirts and waved large Chinese flags . According to Hong Kong Chief Secretary for Administration Henry Tang , 3,000 police were deployed to ensure order .
In February 20 , 1988 , after a week of growing demonstrations in Stepanakert , capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast ( the Armenian majority area within Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic ) , the Regional Soviet voted to secede and join with the Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia . This local vote in a small , remote part of the Soviet Union made headlines around the world ; it was an unprecedented defiance of republic and national authorities . On February 22 , 1988 , in what became known as the " Askeran clash " , two Azerbaijanis were killed by Karabakh police . These deaths , announced on state radio , led to the Sumgait Pogrom . Between February 26 and March 1 , the city of Sumgait ( Azerbaijan ) saw violent anti-Armenian rioting during which 32 people were killed . The authorities totally lost control and occupied the city with paratroopers and tanks ; nearly all of the 14,000 Armenian residents of Sumgait fled .
According to Forbes magazine , Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy Corporation , Chesapeake Energy Corporation , and SandRidge Energy Corporation are the largest private oil-related companies in the nation , and all of Oklahoma 's Fortune 500 companies are energy-related . Tulsa 's ONEOK and Williams Companies are the state 's largest and second-largest companies respectively , also ranking as the nation 's second and third-largest companies in the field of energy , according to Fortune magazine . The magazine also placed Devon Energy as the second-largest company in the mining and crude oil-producing industry in the nation , while Chesapeake Energy ranks seventh respectively in that sector and Oklahoma Gas & Electric ranks as the 25th-largest gas and electric utility company .
Despite the position of the official organizations , an opinion poll carried out between 2001 and 2004 showed that the majority of the Valencian people consider Valencian different from Catalan . This position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly . Furthermore , the data indicates that younger generations educated in Valencian are much less likely to hold these views . A minority of Valencian scholars active in fields other than linguistics defends the position of the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture ( Acadèmia de Cultura Valenciana , RACV ) , which uses for Valencian a standard independent from Catalan .
I Love New York ( stylized I ❤ NY ) is both a logo and a song that are the basis of an advertising campaign and have been used since 1977 to promote tourism in New York City , and later to promote New York State as well . The trademarked logo , owned by New York State Empire State Development , appears in souvenir shops and brochures throughout the city and state , some licensed , many not . The song is the state song of New York .
Some bacteria produce intracellular nutrient storage granules for later use , such as glycogen , polyphosphate , sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates . Certain bacterial species , such as the photosynthetic Cyanobacteria , produce internal gas vesicles , which they use to regulate their buoyancy – allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels . Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria . Used primarily for photosynthesis , they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids . An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes , but these were later shown to be artifacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy . Inclusions are considered to be nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes . The most common inclusions are glycogen , lipid droplets , crystals , and pigments . Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate . These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect ; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or toluidine blue . Gas vacuoles , which are freely permeable to gas , are membrane-bound vesicles present in some species of Cyanobacteria . They allow the bacteria to control their buoyancy . Microcompartments are widespread , membrane-bound organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes . Carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments that contain enzymes involved in carbon fixation . Magnetosomes are bacterial microcompartments , present in magnetotactic bacteria , that contain magnetic crystals .
Additionally , Somalia has several private television networks , including Horn Cable Television and Universal TV . Two such TV stations re-broadcast Al-Jazeera and CNN . Eastern Television Network and SBC TV air from Bosaso , the commercial capital of Puntland . The Puntland and Somaliland regions also each have one government-run TV channel , Puntland TV and Radio and Somaliland National TV , respectively .
The iPod has also been credited with accelerating shifts within the music industry . The iPod 's popularization of digital music storage allows users to abandon listening to entire albums and instead be able to choose specific singles which hastened the end of the Album Era in popular music .
The rulers of the expansionist Qin dynasty , based in present-day Gansu and Shaanxi , were only the first strategists to realize that the area 's military importance matched its commercial and agricultural significance . The Sichuan basin is surrounded by the Himalayas to the west , the Qin Mountains to the north , and mountainous areas of Yunnan to the south . Since the Yangtze flows through the basin and then through the perilous Yangzi Gorges to eastern and southern China , Sichuan was a staging area for amphibious military forces and a refuge for political refugees .

Several Americans , especially Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson , played a major role in bringing Enlightenment ideas to the New World and in influencing British and French thinkers . Franklin was influential for his political activism and for his advances in physics . The cultural exchange during the Age of Enlightenment ran in both directions across the Atlantic . Thinkers such as Paine , Locke , and Rousseau all take Native American cultural practices as examples of natural freedom . The Americans closely followed English and Scottish political ideas , as well as some French thinkers such as Montesquieu . As deists , they were influenced by ideas of John Toland ( 1670–1722 ) and Matthew Tindal ( 1656–1733 ) . During the Enlightenment there was a great emphasis upon liberty , democracy , republicanism and religious tolerance . Attempts to reconcile science and religion resulted in a widespread rejection of prophecy , miracle and revealed religion in preference for Deism – especially by Thomas Paine in The Age of Reason and by Thomas Jefferson in his short Jefferson Bible – from which all supernatural aspects were removed .
During the period from 2000–2005 it is estimated that 49,722 people left the state for the United States . Some 82,000 people are thought to have immigrated to the state from 2000–2005 mainly coming from Veracruz ( 17.6 % ) , United States ( 16.2 % ) , Durango ( 13.2 % ) , Coahuila ( 8.0 % ) and Chiapas ( 4.5 % ) . It is believed that there is a large number of undocumented immigrants in that state the come from Central and South America which mainly settle in Ciudad Juárez . According to the 2005 census , the population grew 1.06 % from 2000 to 2005 . The state has an uneven settlement of people and the lowest population density of any Mexican state ; according to the 2005 census there were 12 people per km2 . Of all the 3,241,444 people in the state , two-thirds ( 2,072,129 ) live in the cities of Ciudad Juárez and Chihuahua . Only three other cities have populations over 100,000 : Parral 101,147 , Cuauhtémoc 105,725 , and Delicias 108,187 .
The site of Richmond had been an important village of the Powhatan Confederacy , and was briefly settled by English colonists from Jamestown in 1609 , and in 1610–1611 . The present city of Richmond was founded in 1737 . It became the capital of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia in 1780 . During the Revolutionary War period , several notable events occurred in the city , including Patrick Henry 's " Give me liberty or give me death " speech in 1775 at St. John 's Church , and the passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom written by Thomas Jefferson . During the American Civil War , Richmond served as the capital of the Confederate States of America . The city entered the 20th century with one of the world 's first successful electric streetcar systems , as well as a national hub of African-American commerce and culture , the Jackson Ward neighborhood .
GE is a multinational conglomerate headquartered in Fairfield , Connecticut . Its main offices are located at 30 Rockefeller Plaza at Rockefeller Center in New York City , known now as the Comcast Building . It was formerly known as the GE Building for the prominent GE logo on the roof ; NBC 's headquarters and main studios are also located in the building . Through its RCA subsidiary , it has been associated with the center since its construction in the 1930s . GE moved its corporate headquarters from the GE Building on Lexington Avenue to Fairfield in 1974 .
Philadelphia 's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for America 's revolutionaries . By the 1750s , Philadelphia had surpassed Boston to become the largest city and busiest port in British America , and second in the British Empire , behind London . The city hosted the First Continental Congress before the American Revolutionary War ; the Second Continental Congress , which signed the United States Declaration of Independence , during the war ; and the Constitutional Convention ( 1787 ) after the war . Several battles were fought in and near Philadelphia as well .
In 1976 , contemporaneously with Woodson and Roberts , the Court decided Gregg v. Georgia and upheld a procedure in which the trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases . At the first proceeding , the jury decides the defendant 's guilt ; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first-degree murder , the death penalty will not be imposed . At the second hearing , the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist , whether any mitigating factors exist , and , in many jurisdictions , weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty – either death or life in prison , either with or without parole .
Burdened with debt , in 2004 Vivendi Universal sold 80 % of Vivendi Universal Entertainment ( including the studio and theme parks ) to General Electric , parent of NBC . The resulting media super-conglomerate was renamed NBCUniversal , while Universal Studios Inc. remained the name of the production subsidiary . After that deal , GE owned 80 % of NBC Universal ; Vivendi held the remaining 20 % , with an option to sell its share in 2006 . GE purchased Vivendi 's share in NBCU in 2011 and in turn sold 51 % of the company to cable provider Comcast . Comcast merged the former GE subsidiary with its own cable-television programming assets , creating the current NBCUniversal . Following Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) approval , the Comcast-GE deal was closed on Jan 29 , 2011 . In March 2013 , Comcast bought the remaining 49 % of NBCUniversal for $ 16.7 billion .
In the months before the attack on Pearl Harbor , Kwajalein Atoll was the administrative center of the Japanese 6th Fleet Forces Service , whose task was the defense of the Marshall Islands .
The original services of an inn are now also available at other establishments , such as hotels , lodges , and motels , which focus more on lodging customers than on other services , although they usually provide meals ; pubs , which are primarily alcohol-serving establishments ; and restaurants and taverns , which serve food and drink . In North America , the lodging aspect of the word " inn " lives on in hotel brand names like Holiday Inn , and in some state laws that refer to lodging operators as innkeepers .
Kadamba ( 345 – 525 CE ) was an ancient royal dynasty of Karnataka , India that ruled northern Karnataka and the Konkan from Banavasi in present-day Uttara Kannada district . At the peak of their power under King Kakushtavarma , the Kadambas of Banavasi ruled large parts of modern Karnataka state . The dynasty was founded by Mayurasharma in 345 CE which at later times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions , an indication to which is provided by the titles and epithets assumed by its rulers . King Mayurasharma defeated the armies of Pallavas of Kanchi possibly with help of some native tribes . The Kadamba fame reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma , a notable ruler with whom even the kings of Gupta Dynasty of northern India cultivated marital alliances . The Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with absolute autonomy . The dynasty later continued to rule as a feudatory of larger Kannada empires , the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires , for over five hundred years during which time they branched into minor dynasties known as the Kadambas of Goa , Kadambas of Halasi and Kadambas of Hangal .
Meanwhile , the Tumed Mongols began moving into the Kokonor region ( modern Qinghai ) , raiding the Ming Chinese frontier and even as far as the suburbs of Beijing under Altan Khan ( 1507–1582 ) . Klieger writes that Altan Khan 's presence in the west effectively reduced Ming influence and contact with Tibet . After Altan Khan made peace with the Ming dynasty in 1571 , he invited the third hierarch of the Gelug—Sönam Gyatso ( 1543–1588 ) —to meet him in Amdo ( modern Qinghai ) in 1578 , where he accidentally bestowed him and his two predecessors with the title of Dalai Lama— " Ocean Teacher " . The full title was " Dalai Lama Vajradhara " , " Vajradhara " meaning " Holder of the Thunderbolt " in Sanskrit . Victoria Huckenpahler notes that Vajradhara is considered by Buddhists to be the primordial Buddha of limitless and all-pervasive beneficial qualities , a being that " represents the ultimate aspect of enlightenment . " Goldstein writes that Sönam Gyatso also enhanced Altan Khan 's standing by granting him the title " king of religion , majestic purity " . Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama officially recognized Altan Khan as the " Protector of the Faith " .
In the early days of association football , known simply as football or soccer , friendly matches ( or " friendlies " ) were the most common type of match . However , since the development of The Football League in England in 1888 , league tournaments became established , in addition to lengthy derby and cup tournaments . By the year 2000 , national leagues were established in almost every country throughout the world , as well as local or regional leagues for lower level teams , thus the significance of friendlies has seriously declined since the 19th century .
By the mid-18th century , Charles Town had become a bustling trade center , the hub of the Atlantic trade for the southern colonies . Charles Towne was also the wealthiest and largest city south of Philadelphia , in part because of the lucrative slave trade . By 1770 , it was the fourth-largest port in the colonies , after Boston , New York , and Philadelphia , with a population of 11,000—slightly more than half of them slaves . By 1708 , the majority of the colony 's population was slaves , and the future state would continue to be a majority of African descent until after the Great Migration of the early 20th century .
Czech ( /ˈtʃɛk/ ; čeština Czech pronunciation : [ ˈt͡ʃɛʃcɪna ] ) , formerly known as Bohemian ( /boʊˈhiːmiən , bə-/ ; lingua Bohemica in Latin ) , is a West Slavic language strongly influenced by Latin and German language , spoken by over 10 million people and it is the official language of the Czech Republic . Czech 's closest relative is Slovak , with which it is mutually intelligible . It is closely related to other West Slavic languages , such as Silesian and Polish . Although most Czech vocabulary is based on shared roots with Slavic , Romance , and Germanic languages , many loanwords ( most associated with high culture ) have been adopted in recent years .
Because of his ability to motivate nationalistic passions , " men , women , and children wept and wailed in the streets " after hearing of his death , according to Nutting . The general Arab reaction was one of mourning , with thousands of people pouring onto the streets of major cities throughout the Arab world . Over a dozen people were killed in Beirut as a result of the chaos , and in Jerusalem , roughly 75,000 Arabs marched through the Old City chanting , " Nasser will never die . " As a testament to his unchallenged leadership of the Arab people , following his death , the headline of the Lebanese Le Jour read , " One hundred million human beings—the Arabs—are orphans . " Sherif Hetata , a former political prisoner and later member Nasser 's ASU , said that " Nasser 's greatest achievement was his funeral . The world will never again see five million people crying together . "
In January 1938 , Milt Gabler started recording for his new label , Commodore Records , and to allow for longer continuous performances , he recorded some 12-inch records . Eddie Condon explained : " Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development . " The first two 12-inch recordings did not take advantage of the extra length : " Carnegie Drag " was 3:15 ; " Carnegie Jump " , 2:41 . But at the second session , on April 30 , the two 12-inch recordings were longer : " Embraceable You " was 4:05 ; " Serenade to a Shylock " , 4:32 . Another way around the time limitation was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record . Vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded " Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean " , written by Irving and Jack Kaufman , as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Cameo . An obvious workaround for longer recordings was to release a set of records . An early multi-record release was in 1903 , when HMV in England made the first complete recording of an opera , Verdi 's Ernani , on 40 single-sided discs . In 1940 , Commodore released Eddie Condon and his Band 's recording of " A Good Man Is Hard to Find " in four parts , issued on both sides of two 12-inch 78s . This limitation on the duration of recordings persisted from 1910 until the invention of the LP record , in 1948 . In popular music , this time limitation of about 3:30 on a 10-inch 78 rpm record meant that singers usually did not release long pieces on record . One exception is Frank Sinatra 's recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein 's " Soliloquy " , from Carousel , made on May 28 , 1946 . Because it ran 7:57 , longer than both sides of a standard 78 rpm 10-inch record , it was released on Columbia 's Masterwork label ( the classical division ) as two sides of a 12-inch record . The same was true of John Raitt 's performance of the song on the original cast album of Carousel , which had been issued on a 78-rpm album set by American Decca in 1945 .
Madonna 's look and style of dressing , her performances , and her music videos influenced young girls and women . Her style became one of the female fashion trends of the 1980s . Created by stylist and jewelry designer Maripol , the look consisted of lace tops , skirts over capri pants , fishnet stockings , jewelry bearing the crucifix , bracelets , and bleached hair . Madonna achieved global recognition after the release of her second studio album , Like a Virgin , in November 1984 . It topped the charts in several countries and became her first number one album on the Billboard 200 . The title track , " Like a Virgin " , topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six consecutive weeks . It attracted the attention of organizations who complained that the song and its accompanying video promoted premarital sex and undermined family values , and moralists sought to have the song and video banned .
In 2001 , Comcast announced it would acquire the assets of the largest cable television operator at the time , AT & T Broadband , for US $ 44.5 billion . The proposed name for the merged company was " AT & T Comcast " , but the companies ultimately decided to keep only the Comcast name . In 2002 , Comcast acquired all assets of AT & T Broadband , thus making Comcast the largest cable television company in the United States with over 22 million subscribers . This also spurred the start of Comcast Advertising Sales ( using AT & T 's groundwork ) which would later be renamed Comcast Spotlight . As part of this acquisition , Comcast also acquired the National Digital Television Center in Centennial , Colorado as a wholly owned subsidiary , which is today known as the Comcast Media Center .
Birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes . Colourful birds , such as parrots and mynas , are bred in captivity or kept as pets , a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered species . Falcons and cormorants have long been used for hunting and fishing , respectively . Messenger pigeons , used since at least 1 AD , remained important as recently as World War II . Today , such activities are more common either as hobbies , for entertainment and tourism , or for sports such as pigeon racing .
Drying produces a decided increase in the strength of wood , particularly in small specimens . An extreme example is the case of a completely dry spruce block 5 cm in section , which will sustain a permanent load four times as great as a green ( undried ) block of the same size will .
Further work on MPEG audio was finalized in 1994 as part of the second suite of MPEG standards , MPEG-2 , more formally known as international standard ISO/IEC 13818-3 ( a.k.a . MPEG-2 Part 3 or backwards compatible MPEG-2 Audio or MPEG-2 Audio BC ) , originally published in 1995 . MPEG-2 Part 3 ( ISO/IEC 13818-3 ) defined additional bit rates and sample rates for MPEG-1 Audio Layer I , II and III . The new sampling rates are exactly half that of those originally defined in MPEG-1 Audio . This reduction in sampling rate serves to cut the available frequency fidelity in half while likewise cutting the bitrate by 50 % . MPEG-2 Part 3 also enhanced MPEG-1 's audio by allowing the coding of audio programs with more than two channels , up to 5.1 multichannel .
Sociological attention to emotion has varied over time . Emilé Durkheim ( 1915/1965 ) wrote about the collective effervescence or emotional energy that was experienced by members of totemic rituals in Australian aborigine society . He explained how the heightened state of emotional energy achieved during totemic rituals transported individuals above themselves giving them the sense that they were in the presence of a higher power , a force , that was embedded in the sacred objects that were worshipped . These feelings of exaltation , he argued , ultimately lead people to believe that there were forces that governed sacred objects .
Von Neumann 's results have been viewed as a special case of linear programming , where von Neumann 's model uses only nonnegative matrices . The study of von Neumann 's model of an expanding economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics . This paper has been called the greatest paper in mathematical economics by several authors , who recognized its introduction of fixed-point theorems , linear inequalities , complementary slackness , and saddlepoint duality . In the proceedings of a conference on von Neumann 's growth model , Paul Samuelson said that many mathematicians had developed methods useful to economists , but that von Neumann was unique in having made significant contributions to economic theory itself .
The Royal Navy is constructing two new larger STOVL aircraft carriers , the Queen Elizabeth class , to replace the three now retired Invincible-class carriers . The ships are HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales . They will be able to operate up to 40 aircraft on peace time operations with a tailored group of up to 50 , and will have a displacement of 70,600 tonnes . HMS Queen Elizabeth is projected to commission in 2017 followed by Prince of Wales in about 2020 . The ships are due to become operational starting in 2020 . Their primary aircraft complement will be made up of F-35B Lightning IIs , and their ship 's company will number around 680 with the total complement rising to about 1600 when the air group is embarked . The two ships will be the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy .
In 2010 , the literacy rate of Liberia was estimated at 60.8 % ( 64.8 % for males and 56.8 % for females ) . In some areas primary and secondary education is free and compulsory from the ages of 6 to 16 , though enforcement of attendance is lax . In other areas children are required to pay a tuition fee to attend school . On average , children attain 10 years of education ( 11 for boys and 8 for girls ) . The country 's education sector is hampered by inadequate schools and supplies , as well as a lack of qualified teachers .
Gautama first went to study with famous religious teachers of the day , and mastered the meditative attainments they taught . But he found that they did not provide a permanent end to suffering , so he continued his quest . He next attempted an extreme asceticism , which was a religious pursuit common among the śramaṇas , a religious culture distinct from the Vedic one . Gautama underwent prolonged fasting , breath-holding , and exposure to pain . He almost starved himself to death in the process . He realized that he had taken this kind of practice to its limit , and had not put an end to suffering . So in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach . He devoted himself to anapanasati meditation , through which he discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way ( Skt . madhyamā-pratipad ) : a path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification .

Peer groups are essential to social and general development . Communication with peers increases significantly during adolescence and peer relationships become more intense than in other stages and more influential to the teen , affecting both the decisions and choices being made . High quality friendships may enhance children 's development regardless of the characteristics of those friends . As children begin to bond with various people and create friendships , it later helps them when they are adolescent and sets up the framework for adolescence and peer groups . Peer groups are especially important during adolescence , a period of development characterized by a dramatic increase in time spent with peers and a decrease in adult supervision . Adolescents also associate with friends of the opposite sex much more than in childhood and tend to identify with larger groups of peers based on shared characteristics . It is also common for adolescents to use friends as coping devices in different situations . A three-factor structure of dealing with friends including avoidance , mastery , and nonchalance has shown that adolescents use friends as coping devices with social stresses .
The Uniform Crime Reports ( UCR ) compile data from over 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the country . They provide detailed data regarding the volume of crimes to include arrest , clearance ( or closing a case ) , and law enforcement officer information . The UCR focuses its data collection on violent crimes , hate crimes , and property crimes . Created in the 1920s , the UCR system has not proven to be as uniform as its name implies . The UCR data only reflect the most serious offense in the case of connected crimes and has a very restrictive definition of rape . Since about 93 % of the data submitted to the FBI is in this format , the UCR stands out as the publication of choice as most states require law enforcement agencies to submit this data .
After the decline of the Teutonic Order following its defeat in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 , and the defeat of the Livonian Order in the Battle of Swienta on 1 September 1435 , the Livonian Confederation Agreement was signed on 4 December 1435 . The Livonian Confederation ceased to exist during the Livonian War ( 1558–82 ) . The wars had reduced the Estonian population from about 250–300,000 people before the Livonian War to 120–140,000 in the 1620s . The Grand Duchy of Moscow and Tsardom of Russia also attempted invasions in 1481 and 1558 , both of which were unsuccessful .
Between the 1992–93 season and the 2012–13 season , Premier League clubs had won the UEFA Champions League four times ( as well as supplying five of the runners-up ) , behind Spain 's La Liga with six wins , and Italy 's Serie A with five wins , and ahead of , among others , Germany 's Bundesliga with three wins ( see table here ) . The FIFA Club World Cup ( or the FIFA Club World Championship , as it was originally called ) has been won by Premier league clubs once ( Manchester United in 2008 ) , and they have also been runners-up twice , behind Brazil 's Brasileirão with four wins , and Spain 's La Liga and Italy 's Serie A with two wins each ( see table here ) .
Insects are the only group of invertebrates to have developed flight . The evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate . Some entomologists suggest that the wings are from paranotal lobes , or extensions from the insect 's exoskeleton called the nota , called the paranotal theory . Other theories are based on a pleural origin . These theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills , spiracular flaps or as from an appendage of the epicoxa . The epicoxal theory suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites , a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa . In the Carboniferous age , some of the Meganeura dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm ( 20 in ) wide wingspan . The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen . The respiratory system of insects constrains their size , however the high oxygen in the atmosphere allowed larger sizes . The largest flying insects today are much smaller and include several moth species such as the Atlas moth and the White Witch ( Thysania agrippina ) .
The German Empire conquered Ukraine during World War I and was planning on either annexing it or installing a puppet king , but was defeated by the Entente , with major involvement by the Ukrainian Bolsheviks . After conquering the rest of Ukraine from the Whites , Ukraine joined the USSR and was enlarged ( gaining Crimea and then Eastern Galicia ) , whence a process of Ukrainization was begun , with encouragement from Moscow .
Jones comments that " Chopin 's unique position as a composer , despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano , has rarely been questioned . " He also notes that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in Paris in 1831— " the artistic environment , the publishers who were willing to print his music , the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what Chopin asked for their lessons " —and these factors , as well as his musical genius , also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation . While his illness and his love-affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of romanticism , the rarity of his public recitals ( as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soirées ) led Arthur Hutchings to suggest that " his lack of Byronic flamboyance [ and ] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional " among his romantic contemporaries , such as Liszt and Henri Herz .
Von Neumann was born Neumann János Lajos ( in Hungarian the family name comes first ) , Hebrew name Yonah , in Budapest , Kingdom of Hungary , which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , to wealthy Jewish parents of the Haskalah . He was the eldest of three children . He had two younger brothers : Michael , born in 1907 , and Nicholas , who was born in 1911 . His father , Neumann Miksa ( Max Neumann ) was a banker , who held a doctorate in law . He had moved to Budapest from Pécs at the end of the 1880s . Miksa 's father and grandfather were both born in Ond ( now part of the town of Szerencs ) , Zemplén County , northern Hungary . John 's mother was Kann Margit ( Margaret Kann ) ; her parents were Jakab Kann and Katalin Meisels . Three generations of the Kann family lived in spacious apartments above the Kann-Heller offices in Budapest ; von Neumann 's family occupied an 18-room apartment on the top floor .
The city slopes gently from the northwest to southeast on a till plain composed largely of glacial and lake clay . The most notable topographical feature in the city is the Detroit Moraine , a broad clay ridge on which the older portions of Detroit and Windsor sit atop , rising approximately 62 feet ( 19 m ) above the river at its highest point . The highest elevation in the city is located directly north of Gorham Playground on the northwest side approximately three blocks south of 8 Mile Road , at a height of 675 to 680 feet ( 206 to 207 m ) . Detroit 's lowest elevation is along the Detroit River , at a surface height of 572 feet ( 174 m ) .
Many television shows and films have been produced which portray in-character professional wrestlers as protagonists , such as Ready to Rumble , ¡Mucha Lucha ! , Nacho Libre , and the Santo film series . In the wildly popular Rocky series of films about the fictional boxer Rocky Balboa , Rocky III saw its hero fighting a " boxer vs. wrestler " exhibition match against the enormous and villainous wrestler " Thunderlips " , portrayed by real-life soon-to-be wrestling icon Hulk Hogan . At least two stage plays set in the world of pro wrestling have been produced : The Baron is a comedy that retells the life of an actual performer known as Baron von Raschke . From Parts Unknown ... is an award-nominated Canadian drama about the rise and fall of a fictional wrestler . The 2009 South Park episode " W.T.F . " played on the soap operatic elements of professional wrestling . One of the lead characters on the Disney Channel series Kim Possible was a huge fan of pro wrestling and actually featured it on an episode ( with two former WWE wrestlers voicing the two fictitious wrestlers featured in the episode ) . The 2008 film The Wrestler , about a washed-up professional wrestler , garnered several Oscar nominations .
In 1840 , St Helena became a provisioning station for the British West Africa Squadron , preventing slavery to Brazil ( mainly ) , and many thousands of slaves were freed on the island . These were all African , and about 500 stayed while the rest were sent on to the West Indies and Cape Town , and eventually to Sierra Leone .
Von Neumann is credited with the equilibrium strategy of mutual assured destruction , providing the deliberately humorous acronym , MAD . ( Other humorous acronyms coined by von Neumann include his computer , the Mathematical Analyzer , Numerical Integrator , and Computer—or MANIAC ) . He also " moved heaven and earth " to bring MAD about . His goal was to quickly develop ICBMs and the compact hydrogen bombs that they could deliver to the USSR , and he knew the Soviets were doing similar work because the CIA interviewed German rocket scientists who were allowed to return to Germany , and von Neumann had planted a dozen technical people in the CIA . The Russians believed that bombers would soon be vulnerable , and they shared von Neumann 's view that an H-bomb in an ICBM was the ne plus ultra of weapons , and they believed that whoever had superiority in these weapons would take over the world , without necessarily using them . He was afraid of a " missile gap " and took several more steps to achieve his goal of keeping up with the Soviets :
On 27 June , Rhee evacuated from Seoul with some of the government . On 28 June , at 2 am , the South Korean Army blew up the highway bridge across the Han River in an attempt to stop the North Korean army . The bridge was detonated while 4,000 refugees were crossing the bridge , and hundreds were killed . Destroying the bridge also trapped many South Korean military units north of the Han River . In spite of such desperate measures , Seoul fell that same day . A number of South Korean National Assemblymen remained in Seoul when it fell , and forty-eight subsequently pledged allegiance to the North .
Season six premiered with the series ' highest-rated debut episode and a few of its succeeding episodes rank among the most watched episodes of American Idol . During this time , many television executives begun to regard the show as a programming force unlike any seen before , as its consistent dominance of up to two hours two or three nights a week exceeded the 30- or 60-minute reach of previous hits such as NBC 's The Cosby Show . The show was dubbed " the Death Star " , and competing networks often rearranged their schedules in order to minimize losses . However , season six also showed a steady decline in viewership over the course of the season . The season finale saw a drop in ratings of 16 % from the previous year . Season six was the first season wherein the average results show rated higher than the competition stages ( unlike in the previous seasons ) , and became the second highest-rated of the series after the preceding season .
Currently , the rapid influx of northerners and immigrants from Latin America is steadily increasing ethnic and religious diversity : the number of Roman Catholics and Jews in the state has increased , as well as general religious diversity . The second-largest Protestant denomination in North Carolina after Baptist traditions is Methodism , which is strong in the northern Piedmont , especially in populous Guilford County . There are also a substantial number of Quakers in Guilford County and northeastern North Carolina . Many universities and colleges in the state have been founded on religious traditions , and some currently maintain that affiliation , including :
The city of Bern or Berne ( German : Bern , pronounced [ bɛrn ] ( listen ) ; French : Berne [ bɛʁn ] ; Italian : Berna [ ˈbɛrna ] ; Romansh : Berna [ ˈbɛrnɐ ] ( help·info ) ; Bernese German : Bärn [ b̥æːrn ] ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland , referred to by the Swiss as their ( e.g . in German ) Bundesstadt , or " federal city " . [ note 1 ] With a population of 140,634 ( November 2015 ) , Bern is the fifth most populous city in Switzerland . The Bern agglomeration , which includes 36 municipalities , had a population of 406,900 in 2014 . The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000 . Bern is also the capital of the Canton of Bern , the second most populous of Switzerland 's cantons .
Over the course of adolescence , the amount of white matter in the brain increases linearly , while the amount of grey matter in the brain follows an inverted-U pattern . Through a process called synaptic pruning , unnecessary neuronal connections in the brain are eliminated and the amount of grey matter is pared down . However , this does not mean that the brain loses functionality ; rather , it becomes more efficient due to increased myelination ( insulation of axons ) and the reduction of unused pathways .
Datta ( 2005 ) shows that , following the collapse of militaristic Boulangism in the late 1880s , the Napoleonic legend was divorced from party politics and revived in popular culture . Concentrating on two plays and two novels from the period—Victorien Sardou 's Madame Sans-Gêne ( 1893 ) , Maurice Barrès 's Les Déracinés ( 1897 ) , Edmond Rostand 's L'Aiglon ( 1900 ) , and André de Lorde and Gyp 's Napoléonette ( 1913 ) Datta examines how writers and critics of the Belle Époque exploited the Napoleonic legend for diverse political and cultural ends .
Subsequently , seven other chiefs on seven other islands signed a treaty in German and Marshallese and a final copy witnessed by Rötger on November 1 was sent to the German Foreign Office . The Germans erected a sign declaring a " Imperial German Protectorate " at Jaluit . It has been speculated that the crisis over the Carolines with Spain , which almost provoked a war , was in fact " a feint to cover the acquisition of the Marshall Islands " , which went almost unnoticed at the time , despite the islands being the largest source of copra in Micronesia . Spain sold the islands to Germany in 1884 through papal mediation .
In addition , the Paris region is served by a light rail network of nine lines , the tramway : Line T1 runs from Asnières-Gennevilliers to Noisy-le-Sec , line T2 runs from Pont de Bezons to Porte de Versailles , line T3a runs from Pont du Garigliano to Porte de Vincennes , line T3b runs from Porte de Vincennes to Porte de la Chapelle , line T5 runs from Saint-Denis to Garges-Sarcelles , line T6 runs from Châtillon to Velizy , line T7 runs from Villejuif to Athis-Mons , line T8 runs from Saint-Denis to Épinay-sur-Seine and Villetaneuse , all of which are operated by the Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens , and line T4 runs from Bondy RER to Aulnay-sous-Bois , which is operated by the state rail carrier SNCF . Five new light rail lines are currently in various stages of development .
Protein digestion occurs in the stomach and duodenum in which 3 main enzymes , pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin secreted by the pancreas , break down food proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids . The digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors , the zymogens . For example , trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen , which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin . Trypsin then cleaves proteins to smaller polypeptides .
Though traditionally a moderate newspaper and sometimes a supporter of the Conservative Party , it supported the Labour Party in the 2001 and 2005 general elections . In 2004 , according to MORI , the voting intentions of its readership were 40 % for the Conservative Party , 29 % for the Liberal Democrats , and 26 % for Labour . The Times had an average daily circulation of 394,448 in March 2014 ; in the same period , The Sunday Times had an average daily circulation of 839,077 . An American edition of The Times has been published since 6 June 2006 . It has been heavily used by scholars and researchers because of its widespread availability in libraries and its detailed index . A complete historical file of the digitized paper is online from Gage Cengage publisher .
The development of flattop vessels produced the first large fleet ships . In 1918 , HMS Argus became the world 's first carrier capable of launching and recovering naval aircraft . As a result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 , which limited the construction of new heavy surface combat ships , most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down ( or had served ) as different ship types : cargo ships , cruisers , battlecruisers , or battleships . These conversions gave rise to the Lexington-class aircraft carriers ( 1927 ) , Akagi and Courageous class . Specialist carrier evolution was well underway , with several navies ordering and building warships that were purposefully designed to function as aircraft carriers by the mid-1920s , resulting in the commissioning of ships such as Hōshō ( 1922 ) , HMS Hermes ( 1924 ) , and Béarn ( 1927 ) . During World War II , these ships would become known as fleet carriers . [ citation needed ]
The Canadian Rangers , who provide surveillance and patrol services in Canada 's arctic and other remote areas , are an essential reserve force component used for Canada 's exercise of sovereignty over its northern territory .
The increased consumption of reading materials of all sorts was one of the key features of the " social " Enlightenment . Developments in the Industrial Revolution allowed consumer goods to be produced in greater quantities at lower prices , encouraging the spread of books , pamphlets , newspapers and journals – " media of the transmission of ideas and attitudes " . Commercial development likewise increased the demand for information , along with rising populations and increased urbanisation . However , demand for reading material extended outside of the realm of the commercial , and outside the realm of the upper and middle classes , as evidenced by the Bibliothèque Bleue . Literacy rates are difficult to gauge , but in France at least , the rates doubled over the course of the 18th century . Reflecting the decreasing influence of religion , the number of books about science and art published in Paris doubled from 1720 to 1780 , while the number of books about religion dropped to just one-tenth of the total .
The birthplace of IBM , Endicott , suffered pollution for decades , however . IBM used liquid cleaning agents in circuit board assembly operation for more than two decades , and six spills and leaks were recorded , including one leak in 1979 of 4,100 gallons from an underground tank . These left behind volatile organic compounds in the town 's soil and aquifer . Traces of volatile organic compounds have been identified in Endicott’s drinking water , but the levels are within regulatory limits . Also , from 1980 , IBM has pumped out 78,000 gallons of chemicals , including trichloroethane , freon , benzene and perchloroethene to the air and allegedly caused several cancer cases among the townspeople . IBM Endicott has been identified by the Department of Environmental Conservation as the major source of pollution , though traces of contaminants from a local dry cleaner and other polluters were also found . Remediation and testing are ongoing , however according to city officials , tests show that the water is safe to drink .
AFL Global and Ganlan Media were created in 2012 by businessman Martin E. Judge , founder and owner of the Judge Group . The company , called AFL Global , LLC , looks to introduce and launch professional Arena Football teams and franchises in various locations throughout the world ( like NFL Europe ) . After their successful trip to China to help promote the game , they formally announced plans to further develop AFL China by the fall of 2014 by starting a comprehensive training program in May 2013 with exhibition games planned for the cities of Beijing and Guangzhou in October . This is the first time professional football of any kind will be played in China with the support of the Chinese government and the CRFA ( Chinese Rugby Football Association ) . Key persons involved include founder and CEO . Martin E. Judge , partner Ron Jaworski , CAFL CEO Gary Morris and president David Niu . Ganlan Media has since dropped this name and will carry the league 's name as its corporate identity .
On August 9 , 2015 , ESPN reported that the New Orleans VooDoo and Las Vegas Outlaws had ceased operations , effective immediately , a claim which was subsequently validated on the AFL website . On September 1 , 2015 , the Spokane Shock officially left the AFL and joined the IFL under the new name Spokane Empire , becoming the fifth active AFL/af2 franchise to leave for the IFL since bankruptcy ( Iowa Barnstormers , Tri-Cities Fever , Green Bay Blizzard and Arkansas Twisters—now the Texas Revolution—left previously ) .
The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis . This is in contrast to some other European Leagues , including La Liga , in which each club sells its rights individually , leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs . The money is divided into three parts : half is divided equally between the clubs ; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position , the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club , and equal steps all the way down the table ; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television , with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this . The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs .
Houston is the seat of the internationally renowned Texas Medical Center , which contains the world 's largest concentration of research and healthcare institutions . All 49 member institutions of the Texas Medical Center are non-profit organizations . They provide patient and preventive care , research , education , and local , national , and international community well-being . Employing more than 73,600 people , institutions at the medical center include 13 hospitals and two specialty institutions , two medical schools , four nursing schools , and schools of dentistry , public health , pharmacy , and virtually all health-related careers . It is where one of the first—and still the largest—air emergency service , Life Flight , was created , and a very successful inter-institutional transplant program was developed . More heart surgeries are performed at the Texas Medical Center than anywhere else in the world .
After a difficult winter , most of the Denny Party relocated across Elliott Bay and claimed land a second time at the site of present-day Pioneer Square . Charles Terry and John Low remained at the original landing location and reestablished their old land claim and called it " New York " , but renamed " New York Alki " in April 1853 , from a Chinook word meaning , roughly , " by and by " or " someday " . For the next few years , New York Alki and Duwamps competed for dominance , but in time Alki was abandoned and its residents moved across the bay to join the rest of the settlers .
Gaddafi organized demonstrations and distributed posters criticizing the monarchy . In October 1961 , he led a demonstration protesting Syria 's secession from the United Arab Republic . During this they broke windows of a local hotel accused of serving alcohol . Catching the authorities ' attention , they expelled his family from Sabha . Gaddafi moved to Misrata , there attending Misrata Secondary School . Maintaining his interest in Arab nationalist activism , he refused to join any of the banned political parties active in the city – including the Arab Nationalist Movement , the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party , and the Muslim Brotherhood – claiming he rejected factionalism . He read voraciously on the subjects of Nasser and the French Revolution of 1789 , as well as the works of Syrian political theorist Michel Aflaq and biographies of Abraham Lincoln , Sun Yat-sen , and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk .
Until the 1990s further replays would be played until one team was victorious . Some ties took as many as six matches to settle ; in their 1975 campaign , Fulham played a total of 12 games over six rounds , which remains the most games played by a team to reach a final . Replays were traditionally played three or four days after the original game , but from 1991–92 they were staged at least 10 days later on police advice . This led to penalty shoot-outs being introduced , the first of which came on 26 November 1991 when Rotherham United eliminated Scunthorpe United .
Strasbourg 's historic city centre , the Grande Île ( Grand Island ) , was classified a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1988 , the first time such an honour was placed on an entire city centre . Strasbourg is immersed in the Franco-German culture and although violently disputed throughout history , has been a bridge of unity between France and Germany for centuries , especially through the University of Strasbourg , currently the second largest in France , and the coexistence of Catholic and Protestant culture . The largest Islamic place of worship in France , the Strasbourg Grand Mosque , was inaugurated by French Interior Minister Manuel Valls on 27 September 2012 .
However , all of these facets of medieval university life are considered by standard scholarship to be independent medieval European developments with no tracable Islamic influence . Generally , some reviewers have pointed out the strong inclination of Makdisi of overstating his case by simply resting on " the accumulation of close parallels " , but all the while failing to point to convincing channels of transmission between the Muslim and Christian world . Norman Daniel points out that the Arab equivalent of the Latin disputation , the taliqa , was reserved for the ruler 's court , not the madrasa , and that the actual differences between Islamic fiqh and medieval European civil law were profound . The taliqa only reached Islamic Spain , the only likely point of transmission , after the establishment of the first medieval universities . In fact , there is no Latin translation of the taliqa and , most importantly , no evidence of Latin scholars ever showing awareness of Arab influence on the Latin method of disputation , something they would have certainly found noteworthy . Rather , it was the medieval reception of the Greek Organon which set the scholastic sic et non in motion . Daniel concludes that resemblances in method had more to with the two religions having " common problems : to reconcile the conflicting statements of their own authorities , and to safeguard the data of revelation from the impact of Greek philosophy " ; thus Christian scholasticism and similar Arab concepts should be viewed in terms of a parallel occurrence , not of the transmission of ideas from one to the other , a view shared by Hugh Kennedy .
Horizontal gene transfer refers to the transfer of genetic material through a mechanism other than reproduction . This mechanism is a common source of new genes in prokaryotes , sometimes thought to contribute more to genetic variation than gene duplication . It is a common means of spreading antibiotic resistance , virulence , and adaptive metabolic functions . Although horizontal gene transfer is rare in eukaryotes , likely examples have been identified of protist and alga genomes containing genes of bacterial origin .
In February 1853 , the British government of Lord Aberdeen , the prime minister , re-appointed Stratford Canning as British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire . :110 Having resigned the ambassadorship in January , he had been replaced by Colonel Rose as chargé d'affaires . Lord Stratford then turned around and sailed back to Constantinople , arriving there on 5 April 1853 . There he convinced the Sultan to reject the Russian treaty proposal , as compromising the independence of the Turks . The Leader of the Opposition in the British House of Commons , Benjamin Disraeli , blamed Aberdeen and Stratford 's actions for making war inevitable , thus starting the process which would eventually force the Aberdeen government to resign in January 1855 , over the war .
In Asia , various Chinese dynasties and Japanese shogunates controlled the Asian sphere . In Japan , the Edo period from 1600 to 1868 is also referred to as the early modern period . And in Korea , from the rising of Joseon Dynasty to the enthronement of King Gojong is referred to as the early modern period . In the Americas , Native Americans had built a large and varied civilization , including the Aztec Empire and alliance , the Inca civilization , the Mayan Empire and cities , and the Chibcha Confederation . In the west , the European kingdoms and movements were in a movement of reformation and expansion . Russia reached the Pacific coast in 1647 and consolidated its control over the Russian Far East in the 19th century .
City and Guilds College was founded in 1876 from a meeting of 16 of the City of London 's livery companies for the Advancement of Technical Education ( CGLI ) , which aimed to improve the training of craftsmen , technicians , technologists , and engineers . The two main objectives were to create a Central Institution in London and to conduct a system of qualifying examinations in technical subjects . Faced with their continuing inability to find a substantial site , the Companies were eventually persuaded by the Secretary of the Science and Art Department , General Sir John Donnelly ( who was also a Royal Engineer ) to found their institution on the eighty-seven acre ( 350,000 m² ) site at South Kensington bought by the 1851 Exhibition Commissioners ( for GBP 342,500 ) for 'purposes of art and science ' in perpetuity . The latter two colleges were incorporated by Royal Charter into the Imperial College of Science and Technology and the CGLI Central Technical College was renamed the City and Guilds College in 1907 , but not incorporated into Imperial College until 1910 .
Christianity came to Tuvalu in 1861 when Elekana , a deacon of a Congregational church in Manihiki , Cook Islands became caught in a storm and drifted for 8 weeks before landing at Nukulaelae on 10 May 1861 . Elekana began proselytising Christianity . He was trained at Malua Theological College , a London Missionary Society ( LMS ) school in Samoa , before beginning his work in establishing the Church of Tuvalu . In 1865 the Rev . A. W. Murray of the LMS – a Protestant congregationalist missionary society – arrived as the first European missionary where he too proselytised among the inhabitants of Tuvalu . By 1878 Protestantism was well established with preachers on each island . In the later 19th and early 20th centuries the ministers of what became the Church of Tuvalu ( Te Ekalesia Kelisiano Tuvalu ) were predominantly Samoans , who influenced the development of the Tuvaluan language and the music of Tuvalu .
Scotland 's and Northern Ireland 's licensing laws have long been more flexible , allowing local authorities to set pub opening and closing times . In Scotland , this stemmed out of [ clarification needed ] a late repeal of the wartime licensing laws , which stayed in force until 1976 .
Many of NARA 's most requested records are frequently used for genealogy research . This includes census records from 1790 to 1930 , ships ' passenger lists , and naturalization records .
The hydraulic crane was invented by Sir William Armstrong in 1846 , primarily for use at the Tyneside docks for loading cargo . These quickly supplanted the earlier steam driven elevators : exploiting Pascal 's law , they provided a much greater force . A water pump supplied a variable level of water pressure to a plunger encased inside a vertical cylinder , allowing the level of the platform ( carrying a heavy load ) to be raised and lowered . Counterweights and balances were also used to increase the lifting power of the apparatus .
Plymouth Council is currently undertaking a project of urban redevelopment called the " Vision for Plymouth " launched by the architect David Mackay and backed by both Plymouth City Council and the Plymouth Chamber of Commerce ( PCC ) . Its projects range from shopping centres , a cruise terminal , a boulevard and to increase the population to 300,000 and build 33,000 dwellings .

Morality plays emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished until 1550 . The most interesting morality play is The Castle of Perseverance which depicts mankind 's progress from birth to death . However , the most famous morality play and perhaps best known medieval drama is Everyman . Everyman receives Death 's summons , struggles to escape and finally resigns himself to necessity . Along the way , he is deserted by Kindred , Goods , and Fellowship - only Good Deeds goes with him to the grave .
While technically referring to the era before Christopher Columbus ' voyages of 1492 to 1504 , in practice the term usually includes the history of American indigenous cultures until Europeans either conquered or significantly influenced them , even if this happened decades or even centuries after Columbus ' initial landing . " Pre-Columbian " is used especially often in the context of discussing the great indigenous civilizations of the Americas , such as those of Mesoamerica ( the Olmec , the Toltec , the Teotihuacano , the Zapotec , the Mixtec , the Aztec , and the Maya civilizations ) and those of the Andes ( Inca Empire , Moche culture , Muisca Confederation , Cañaris ) .
Social insects , such as termites , ants and many bees and wasps , are the most familiar species of eusocial animal . They live together in large well-organized colonies that may be so tightly integrated and genetically similar that the colonies of some species are sometimes considered superorganisms . It is sometimes argued that the various species of honey bee are the only invertebrates ( and indeed one of the few non-human groups ) to have evolved a system of abstract symbolic communication where a behavior is used to represent and convey specific information about something in the environment . In this communication system , called dance language , the angle at which a bee dances represents a direction relative to the sun , and the length of the dance represents the distance to be flown . :309–311 Though perhaps not as advanced as honey bees , bumblebees also potentially have some social communication behaviors . Bombus terrestris , for example , exhibit a faster learning curve for visiting unfamiliar , yet rewarding flowers , when they can see a conspecific foraging on the same species .
But in statistical mechanics things get more complicated . On one hand , statistical mechanics is far superior to classical thermodynamics , in that thermodynamic behavior , such as glass breaking , can be explained by the fundamental laws of physics paired with a statistical postulate . But statistical mechanics , unlike classical thermodynamics , is time-reversal symmetric . The second law of thermodynamics , as it arises in statistical mechanics , merely states that it is overwhelmingly likely that net entropy will increase , but it is not an absolute law .
The Lost Pubs Project listed 28,095 closed pubs on 21 April 2015 , with photographs of many . In 2015 the rate of pub closures came under the scrutiny of Parliament in the UK , with a promise of legislation to improve relations between owners and tenants .
The distinctive characteristic of Gothic cathedrals of the Iberian Peninsula is their spatial complexity , with many areas of different shapes leading from each other . They are comparatively wide , and often have very tall arcades surmounted by low clerestories , giving a similar spacious appearance to the 'Hallenkirche of Germany , as at the Church of the Batalha Monastery in Portugal . Many of the cathedrals are completely surrounded by chapels . Like English cathedrals , each is often stylistically diverse . This expresses itself both in the addition of chapels and in the application of decorative details drawn from different sources . Among the influences on both decoration and form are Islamic architecture and , towards the end of the period , Renaissance details combined with the Gothic in a distinctive manner . The West front , as at Leon Cathedral , typically resembles a French west front , but wider in proportion to height and often with greater diversity of detail and a combination of intricate ornament with broad plain surfaces . At Burgos Cathedral there are spires of German style . The roofline often has pierced parapets with comparatively few pinnacles . There are often towers and domes of a great variety of shapes and structural invention rising above the roof .
He does not argue that any such conclusions are therefore true , or that this describes the actual methods of any particular scientist . [ citation needed ] Rather , it is recommended as an essential principle of methodology that , if enacted by a system or community , will lead to slow but steady progress of a sort ( relative to how well the system or community enacts the method ) . It has been suggested that Popper 's ideas are often mistaken for a hard logical account of truth because of the historical co-incidence of their appearing at the same time as logical positivism , the followers of which mistook his aims for their own .
IBM has constantly evolved since its inception . Over the past decade , it has steadily shifted its business mix by exiting commoditizing markets such as PCs , hard disk drives and DRAMs and focusing on higher-value , more profitable markets such as business intelligence , data analytics , business continuity , security , cloud computing , virtualization and green solutions , resulting in a higher quality revenue stream and higher profit margins . IBM 's operating margin expanded from 16.8 % in 2004 to 24.3 % in 2013 , and net profit margins expanded from 9.0 % in 2004 to 16.5 % in 2013 .
President Franklin D. Roosevelt promoted a " good neighbor " policy that sought better relations with Mexico . In 1935 a federal judge ruled that three Mexican immigrants were ineligible for citizenship because they were not white , as required by federal law . Mexico protested , and Roosevelt decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated Hispanics as white . The State Department , the Census Bureau , the Labor Department , and other government agencies therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of Mexican descent as white . This policy encouraged the League of United Latin American Citizens in its quest to minimize discrimination by asserting their whiteness .
In 1981 , large sections of the SEPTA Regional Rail service to the far suburbs of Philadelphia were discontinued due to lack of funding . Several projects have been proposed to extend rail service back to these areas , but lack of funding has again been the chief obstacle to implementation . These projects include the proposed Schuylkill Valley Metro to Wyomissing , PA , and extension of the Media/Elwyn line back to Wawa , PA. SEPTA 's Airport Regional Rail Line Regional Rail offers direct service to the Philadelphia International Airport .
Modern standard Italian itself is heavily based on the Latin-derived Florentine Tuscan language . The Tuscan-based language that would eventually become modern standard Italian had been used in poetry and literature since at least the 12th century , and it first became widely known in Italy through the works of authors such as Dante Alighieri , Giovanni Boccaccio , Niccolò Machiavelli , and Petrarch . Dante 's Florentine-Tuscan literary Italian thus became the language of the literate and upper class in Italy , and it spread throughout the peninsula as the lingua franca among the Italian educated class as well as Italian traveling merchants . The economic prowess and cultural and artistic importance of Tuscany in the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance further encouraged the diffusion of the Florentine-Tuscan Italian throughout Italy and among the educated and powerful , though local and regional languages remained the main languages of the common people .
The Portuguese language is derived from the Latin spoken by the romanized Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula around 2000 years ago—particularly the Celts , Tartessians , Lusitanians and Iberians . In the 15th and 16th centuries , the language spread worldwide as Portugal established a colonial and commercial empire between 1415 and 1999 . Portuguese is now spoken as a native language in five different continents , with Brazil accounting for the largest number of native Portuguese speakers of any country ( 200 million speakers in 2012 ) .
Philadelphia is also a major hub for Greyhound Lines , which operates 24-hour service to points east of the Mississippi River . Most of Greyhound 's services in Philadelphia operate to/from the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal , located at 1001 Filbert Street in Center City Philadelphia . In 2006 , the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal was the second busiest Greyhound terminal in the United States , after the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York . Besides Greyhound , six other bus operators provide service to the Center City Greyhound terminal : Bieber Tourways , Capitol Trailways , Martz Trailways , Peter Pan Bus Lines , Susquehanna Trailways , and the bus division for New Jersey Transit . Other services include Megabus and Bolt Bus .
For several decades , peace reigned in Tibet , but in 1792 the Qing Qianlong Emperor sent a large Chinese army into Tibet to push the invading Nepalese out . This prompted yet another Qing reorganization of the Tibetan government , this time through a written plan called the " Twenty-Nine Regulations for Better Government in Tibet " . Qing military garrisons staffed with Qing troops were now also established near the Nepalese border . Tibet was dominated by the Manchus in various stages in the 18th century , and the years immediately following the 1792 regulations were the peak of the Qing imperial commissioners ' authority ; but there was no attempt to make Tibet a Chinese province .
Following the purchase of an offshore lease in 2005 , Shell initiated its US $ 4.5 billion Arctic drilling program in 2006 , after the corporation purchased the " Kulluk " oil rig and leased the Noble Discoverer drillship . At inception , the project was led by Pete Slaiby , a Shell executive who had previously worked in the North Sea . However , after the purchase of a second offshore lease in 2008 , Shell only commenced drilling work in 2012 , due to the refurbishment of rigs , permit delays from the relevant authorities and lawsuits . The plans to drill in the Arctic led to protests from environmental groups , particularly Greenpeace ; furthermore , analysts in the energy field , as well as related industries , also expressed skepticism due to perceptions that drilling in the region is " too dangerous because of harsh conditions and remote locations " .
In 2002 , Queen 's " Bohemian Rhapsody " was voted " the UK 's favourite hit of all time " in a poll conducted by the Guinness World Records British Hit Singles Book . In 2004 the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame . Many scholars consider the " Bohemian Rhapsody " music video ground-breaking , and credit it with popularising the medium . Rock historian Paul Fowles states the song is " widely credited as the first global hit single for which an accompanying video was central to the marketing strategy " . It has been hailed as launching the MTV age . Acclaimed for their stadium rock , in 2005 an industry poll ranked Queen 's performance at Live Aid in 1985 as the best live act in history . In 2007 , they were also voted the greatest British band in history by BBC Radio 2 listeners .
The Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that jñāna ( knowledge ) is a sufficient means to moksha . It suggests that systematic techniques/practice ( personal experimentation ) combined with Samkhya 's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha . Yoga shares several central ideas with Advaita Vedanta , with the difference that Yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while Advaita Vedanta is a form of monistic personalism . Like Advaita Vedanta , the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy states that liberation/freedom in this life is achievable , and this occurs when an individual fully understands and realizes the equivalence of Atman ( soul , self ) and Brahman .
Somalis for centuries have practiced a form of customary law , which they call Xeer . Xeer is a polycentric legal system where there is no monopolistic agent that determines what the law should be or how it should be interpreted .
In 1945 , Plymouth-born Michael Foot was elected Labour MP for the war-torn constituency of Plymouth Devonport and after serving as Secretary of State for Education and responsible for the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act , went on to become one of the most distinguished leaders of the Labour party .
One of Hyderabad 's earliest newspapers , The Deccan Times , was established in the 1780s . In modern times , the major Telugu dailies published in Hyderabad are Eenadu , Andhra Jyothy , Sakshi and Namaste Telangana , while the major English papers are The Times of India , The Hindu and The Deccan Chronicle . The major Urdu papers include The Siasat Daily , The Munsif Daily and Etemaad . Many coffee table magazines , professional magazines and research journals are also regularly published . The Secunderabad Cantonment Board established the first radio station in Hyderabad State around 1919 . Deccan Radio was the first radio public broadcast station in the city starting on 3 February 1935 , with FM broadcasting beginning in 2000 . The available channels in Hyderabad include All India Radio , Radio Mirchi , Radio City , Red FM and Big FM .
Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest , filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete , in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called Pumping Iron . Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition , after losing significant weight to appear in the film Stay Hungry with Jeff Bridges . Lou Ferrigno proved not to be a threat , and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia .
Germany 's strong ties with Israel include cooperation on scientific and educational endeavors and the two states remain strong economic and military partners . Under the reparations agreement , by 2007 [ update ] Germany had paid 25 billion euros in reparations to the Israeli state and individual Israeli Holocaust survivors . The UK has kept full diplomatic relations with Israel since its formation having had two visits from heads of state in 2007 . The UK is seen as having a " natural " relationship with Israel on account of the British Mandate for Palestine . Relations between the two countries were also made stronger by former prime minister Tony Blair 's efforts for a two state resolution . Israel is included in the European Union 's European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) , which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer .
Portugal has considerable resources of wind and river power , the two most cost-effective renewable sources . Since the turn of the 21st century , there has been a trend towards the development of a renewable resource industry and reduction of both consumption and use of fossil fuel resources . In 2006 , the world 's largest solar power plant at that date , the Moura Photovoltaic Power Station , began operating near Moura , in the south , while the world 's first commercial wave power farm , the Aguçadoura Wave Farm , opened in the Norte region ( 2008 ) . By the end of 2006 , 66 % of the country 's electrical production was from coal and fuel power plants , while 29 % were derived from hydroelectric dams , and 6 % by wind energy .
Unlike other data cables ( e.g. , Ethernet , HDMI ) , each end of a USB cable uses a different kind of connector ; a Type-A or a Type-B . This kind of design was chosen to prevent electrical overloads and damaged equipment , as only the Type-A socket provides power . There are cables with Type-A connectors on both ends , but they should be used carefully . Therefore , in general , each of the different " sizes " requires four different connectors ; USB cables have the Type-A and Type-B plugs , and the corresponding receptacles are on the computer or electronic device . In common practice , the Type-A connector is usually the full size , and the Type-B side can vary as needed .
With the rise of disco in the US and punk rock in the UK , hard rock 's mainstream dominance was rivalled toward the later part of the decade . Disco appealed to a more diverse group of people and punk seemed to take over the rebellious role that hard rock once held . Early punk bands like The Ramones explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock , with almost all of their songs clocking in around two minutes with no guitar solos . However , new rock acts continued to emerge and record sales remained high into the 1980s . 1977 saw the début and rise to stardom of Foreigner , who went on to release several platinum albums through to the mid-1980s . Midwestern groups like Kansas , REO Speedwagon and Styx helped further cement heavy rock in the Midwest as a form of stadium rock . In 1978 , Van Halen emerged from the Los Angeles music scene with a sound based around the skills of lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen . He popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping , showcased on the song " Eruption " from the album Van Halen , which was highly influential in re-establishing hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion , while also redefining and elevating the role of electric guitar .
Once in Hollywood , the contestants perform individually or in groups in a series of rounds . Until season ten , there were usually three rounds of eliminations in Hollywood . In the first round the contestants emerged in groups but performed individually . For the next round , the contestants put themselves in small groups and perform a song together . In the final round , the contestants perform solo with a song of their choice a cappella or accompanied by a band‍—‌depending on the season . In seasons two and three , contestants were also asked to write original lyrics or melody in an additional round after the first round . In season seven , the group round was eliminated and contestants may , after a first solo performance and on judges approval , skip a second solo round and move directly to the final Hollywood round . In season twelve , the executive producers split up the females and males and chose the members to form the groups in the group round .
The third-generation iPod had a weak bass response , as shown in audio tests . The combination of the undersized DC-blocking capacitors and the typical low-impedance of most consumer headphones form a high-pass filter , which attenuates the low-frequency bass output . Similar capacitors were used in the fourth-generation iPods . The problem is reduced when using high-impedance headphones and is completely masked when driving high-impedance ( line level ) loads , such as an external headphone amplifier . The first-generation iPod Shuffle uses a dual-transistor output stage , rather than a single capacitor-coupled output , and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load .
Boston ( pronounced i/ˈbɒstən/ ) is the capital and largest city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States . Boston also served as the historic county seat of Suffolk County until Massachusetts disbanded county government in 1999 . The city proper covers 48 square miles ( 124 km2 ) with an estimated population of 655,884 in 2014 , making it the largest city in New England and the 24th largest city in the United States . The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area called Greater Boston , home to 4.7 million people and the tenth-largest metropolitan statistical area in the country . Greater Boston as a commuting region is home to 8.1 million people , making it the sixth-largest combined statistical area in the United States .
The transistor is the fundamental building block of modern electronic devices , and is ubiquitous in modern electronic systems . First conceived by Julius Lilienfeld in 1926 and practically implemented in 1947 by American physicists John Bardeen , Walter Brattain , and William Shockley , the transistor revolutionized the field of electronics , and paved the way for smaller and cheaper radios , calculators , and computers , among other things . The transistor is on the list of IEEE milestones in electronics , and Bardeen , Brattain , and Shockley shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for their achievement .
Hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals . Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice . These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks , but the gas 's high solubility is a metallurgical problem , contributing to the embrittlement of many metals , complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks .
Hume and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed a 'science of man ' , which was expressed historically in works by authors including James Burnett , Adam Ferguson , John Millar , and William Robertson , all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behaved in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of modernity . Modern sociology largely originated from this movement , and Hume 's philosophical concepts that directly influenced James Madison ( and thus the U.S. Constitution ) and as popularised by Dugald Stewart , would be the basis of classical liberalism .
In June 1940 , a German prisoner of war was overheard boasting that the British would never find the Knickebein , even though it was under their noses . The details of the conversation were passed to an RAF Air Staff technical advisor , Dr. R. V. Jones , who started an in-depth investigation which discovered that the Luftwaffe 's Lorenz receivers were more than blind-landing devices . Jones therefore began a search for the German beams . Avro Ansons of the Beam Approach Training Development Unit ( BATDU ) were flown up and down Britain fitted with a 30 MHz receiver to detect them . Soon a beam was traced to Derby ( which had been mentioned in Luftwaffe transmissions ) . The first jamming operations were carried out using requisitioned hospital electrocautery machines . A subtle form of distortion was introduced . Up to nine special transmitters directed their signals at the beams in a manner that widened its path , negating its ability to accurately locate targets . Confidence in the device was diminished by the time the Luftwaffe decided to launch large-scale raids . The counter operations were carried out by British Electronic Counter Measures ( ECM ) units under Wing Commander Edward Addison , No . 80 Wing RAF . The production of false radio navigation signals by re-transmitting the originals was a technique known as masking beacons ( meacons ) .
PAL consoles face another incompatibility when playing out-of-region cartridges : the NTSC video standard specifies video at 60 Hz while PAL operates at 50 Hz , resulting in approximately 16.7 % slower gameplay . Additionally , PAL 's higher resolution results in letterboxing of the output image . Some commercial PAL region releases exhibit this same problem and , therefore , can be played in NTSC systems without issue while others will face a 20 % speedup if played in an NTSC console . To mostly correct this issue , a switch can be added to place the SNES PPU into a 60 Hz mode supported by most newer PAL televisions . Later games will detect this setting and refuse to run , requiring the switch to be thrown only after the check completes .
The pricing of risk refers to the incremental compensation required by investors for taking on additional risk , which may be measured by interest rates or fees . Several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks ' risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis , enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have , and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward , readily understandable format .
According to Tilmann Vetter , the core of earliest Buddhism is the practice of dhyāna . Bronkhorst agrees that dhyana was a Buddhist invention , whereas Norman notes that " the Buddha 's way to release [ ... ] was by means of meditative practices . " Discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development .
In about 319 , when Athanasius was a deacon , a presbyter named Arius came into a direct conflict with Alexander of Alexandria . It appears that Arius reproached Alexander for what he felt were misguided or heretical teachings being taught by the bishop . Arius 's theological views appear to have been firmly rooted in Alexandrian Christianity , and his Christological views were certainly not radical at all . He embraced a subordinationist Christology which taught that Christ was the divine Son ( Logos ) of God , made , not begotten , heavily influenced by Alexandrian thinkers like Origen , and which was a common Christological view in Alexandria at the time . Support for Arius from powerful bishops like Eusebius of Caesarea and Eusebius of Nicomedia , further illustrate how Arius 's subordinationist Christology was shared by other Christians in the Empire . Arius was subsequently excommunicated by Alexander , and he would begin to elicit the support of many bishops who agreed with his position .
Health care delivery in Nigeria is a concurrent responsibility of the three tiers of government in the country , and the private sector . Nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987 , which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population , in part by implementing user fees . The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform , resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services . A comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of health care , with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost .
During the May Revolution of 1810 and the subsequent uprising of the provinces of Rio de la Plata , the Spanish colonial government moved to Montevideo . During that year and the next , Uruguayan revolutionary José Gervasio Artigas united with others from Buenos Aires against Spain . In 1811 , the forces deployed by the Junta Grande of Buenos Aires and the gaucho forces led by Artigas started a siege of Montevideo , which had refused to obey the directives of the new authorities of the May Revolution . The siege was lifted at the end of that year , when the military situation started deteriorating in the Upper Peru region .
Federalism refers to the mixed or compound mode of government , combining a general government ( the central or 'federal ' government ) with regional governments ( provincial , state , Land , cantonal , territorial or other sub-unit governments ) in a single political system . Its distinctive feature , exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism of the United States of America under the Constitution of 1789 , is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established . It can thus be defined as a form of government in which there is a division of powers between two levels of government of equal status .
The Frankish kingdom in northern Gaul split into kingdoms called Austrasia , Neustria , and Burgundy during the 6th and 7th centuries , all of them ruled by the Merovingian dynasty , who were descended from Clovis . The 7th century was a tumultuous period of wars between Austrasia and Neustria . Such warfare was exploited by Pippin ( d. 640 ) , the Mayor of the Palace for Austrasia who became the power behind the Austrasian throne . Later members of his family inherited the office , acting as advisers and regents . One of his descendants , Charles Martel ( d. 741 ) , won the Battle of Poitiers in 732 , halting the advance of Muslim armies across the Pyrenees . [ K ] Great Britain was divided into small states dominated by the kingdoms of Northumbria , Mercia , Wessex , and East Anglia , which were descended from the Anglo-Saxon invaders . Smaller kingdoms in present-day Wales and Scotland were still under the control of the native Britons and Picts . Ireland was divided into even smaller political units , usually known as tribal kingdoms , under the control of kings . There were perhaps as many as 150 local kings in Ireland , of varying importance .
The pulp papermaking process is said to have been developed in China during the early 2nd century AD , possibly as early as the year 105 A.D. , by the Han court eunuch Cai Lun , although the earliest archaeological fragments of paper derive from the 2nd century BC in China . The modern pulp and paper industry is global , with China leading its production and the United States right behind it .
The city hosted the 1964 Democratic National Convention which nominated Lyndon Johnson for President and Hubert Humphrey as Vice President . The convention and the press coverage it generated , however , cast a harsh light on Atlantic City , which by then was in the midst of a long period of economic decline . Many felt that the friendship between Johnson and Governor of New Jersey Richard J. Hughes led Atlantic City to host the Democratic Convention .
Although they did not fix their schedules to the clock in the modern sense , ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than modern DST does , often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of day length , so that each daylight hour was longer during summer . For example , Roman water clocks had different scales for different months of the year : at Rome 's latitude the third hour from sunrise , hora tertia , started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice , but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes . After ancient times , equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal , so civil time no longer varies by season . Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings , such as some Mount Athos monasteries and all Jewish ceremonies .
Houston ( i/ˈhjuːstən/ HYOO-stən ) is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth most populous city in the United States , located in Southeast Texas near the Gulf of Mexico . With a census-estimated 2014 population of 2.239 million people , within a land area of 599.6 square miles ( 1,553 km2 ) , it also is the largest city in the Southern United States , as well as the seat of Harris County . It is the principal city of Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land , which is the fifth most populated metropolitan area in the United States .
The infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers . Cold , dark molecular clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars . Infrared can also be used to detect protostars before they begin to emit visible light . Stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum , so nearby cool objects such as planets can be more readily detected . ( In the visible light spectrum , the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet . )
Following his triumph , Napoleon imposed the first elements of the Continental System through the Berlin Decree issued in November 1806 . The Continental System , which prohibited European nations from trading with Britain , was widely violated throughout his reign . In the next few months , Napoleon marched against the advancing Russian armies through Poland and was involved in the bloody stalemate at the Battle of Eylau in February 1807 . After a period of rest and consolidation on both sides , the war restarted in June with an initial struggle at Heilsberg that proved indecisive . On 14 June , however , Napoleon finally obtained an overwhelming victory over the Russians at the Battle of Friedland , wiping out the majority of the Russian army in a very bloody struggle . The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French . On 19 June , Czar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon . The latter assured the envoy that the Vistula River represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe . On that basis , the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of Tilsit after meeting on an iconic raft on the River Niemen . The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated : " I hate the English as much as you do . "
Land Forces during this period also deployed in support of peacekeeping operations within United Nations sanctioned conflicts . The nature of the Canadian Forces has continued to evolve . They have been deployed in Afghanistan until 2011 , under the NATO-led United Nations International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) , at the request of the Government of Afghanistan .
Unauthorized MP3 file sharing continues on next-generation peer-to-peer networks . Some authorized services , such as Beatport , Bleep , Juno Records , eMusic , Zune Marketplace , Walmart.com , Rhapsody , the recording industry approved re-incarnation of Napster , and Amazon.com sell unrestricted music in the MP3 format .
After being rendered obsolete by the redesign , the 1895 replica was presented in 1910 to the FA 's long-serving president Lord Kinnaird . Kinnaird died in 1923 , and his family kept it in their possession , out of view , until putting it up for auction in 2005 . It was duly sold at Christie 's auction house on 19 May 2005 for £420,000 ( £478,400 including auction fees and taxes ) . The sale price set a new world record for a piece of football memorabilia , surpassing the £254,000 paid for the Jules Rimet World Cup Trophy in 1997 . The successful bidder was David Gold , the then joint chairman of Birmingham City ; claiming the FA and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country , Gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation . Accordingly , Gold presented the trophy to the National Football Museum in Preston on 20 April 2006 , where it went on immediate public display . It later moved with the museum to its new location in Manchester . In November 2012 , it was ceremonially presented to Royal Engineers , after they beat Wanderers 7–1 in a charity replay of the first FA Cup final .
Slack ( 2003 ) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970 . Yale proved important as a site for this research . The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison , Grace E. Pickford , and G. Evelyn Hutchinson , and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists . All produced innovative research , including the opening of new subfields in embryology , endocrinology , and ecology , respectively , over a long period of time . Harrison 's group is shown to have been a classic research school ; Pickford 's and Hutchinson 's were not . Pickford 's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power . Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive , but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools . Hutchinson 's example shows that new models for research groups are needed , especially for those that include extensive field research .
In a tumbling pass , dismount or vault , landing is the final phase , following take off and flight This is a critical skill in terms of execution in competition scores , general performance , and injury occurrence . Without the necessary magnitude of energy dissipation during impact , the risk of sustaining injuries during somersaulting increases . These injuries commonly occur at the lower extremities such as : cartilage lesions , ligament tears , and bone bruises/fractures . To avoid such injuries , and to receive a high performance score , proper technique must be used by the gymnast . " The subsequent ground contact or impact landing phase must be achieved using a safe , aesthetic and well-executed double foot landing . " A successful landing in gymnastics is classified as soft , meaning the knee and hip joints are at greater than 63 degrees of flexion .
In 1644 , René Descartes theorized that pain was a disturbance that passed down along nerve fibers until the disturbance reached the brain , a development that transformed the perception of pain from a spiritual , mystical experience to a physical , mechanical sensation [ citation needed ] . Descartes 's work , along with Avicenna 's , prefigured the 19th-century development of specificity theory . Specificity theory saw pain as " a specific sensation , with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses " . Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory , which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality , but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light , pressure or temperature . By the mid-1890s , specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians , and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists . However , after a series of clinical observations by Henry Head and experiments by Max von Frey , the psychologists migrated to specificity almost en masse , and by century 's end , most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact .
Post-punk is a heterogeneous type of rock music that emerged in the wake of the punk movement of the 1970s . Drawing inspiration from elements of punk rock while departing from its musical conventions and wider cultural affiliations , post-punk music was marked by varied , experimentalist sensibilities and its " conceptual assault " on rock tradition . Artists embraced electronic music , black dance styles and the avant-garde , as well as novel recording technology and production techniques . The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics , as artists liberally drew on sources such as critical theory , cinema , performance art and modernist literature . Accompanying these musical developments were subcultures that produced visual art , multimedia performances , independent record labels and fanzines in conjunction with the music .
Drama is literature intended for performance . The form is often combined with music and dance , as in opera and musical theatre . A play is a subset of this form , referring to the written dramatic work of a playwright that is intended for performance in a theatre ; it comprises chiefly dialogue between characters , and usually aims at dramatic or theatrical performance rather than at reading . A closet drama , by contrast , refers to a play written to be read rather than to be performed ; hence , it is intended that the meaning of such a work can be realized fully on the page . Nearly all drama took verse form until comparatively recently .
Feynman was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society ( ForMemRS ) in 1965 . At this time in the early 1960s , Feynman exhausted himself by working on multiple major projects at the same time , including a request , while at Caltech , to " spruce up " the teaching of undergraduates . After three years devoted to the task , he produced a series of lectures that eventually became The Feynman Lectures on Physics . He wanted a picture of a drumhead sprinkled with powder to show the modes of vibration at the beginning of the book . Concerned over the connections to drugs and rock and roll that could be made from the image , the publishers changed the cover to plain red , though they included a picture of him playing drums in the foreword . The Feynman Lectures on Physics occupied two physicists , Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands , as part-time co-authors for several years . Even though the books were not adopted by most universities as textbooks , they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics . Many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books , including The Character of Physical Law , QED : The Strange Theory of Light and Matter , Statistical Mechanics , Lectures on Gravitation , and the Feynman Lectures on Computation .
In 2001 , she became the first African-American woman and second woman songwriter to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the American Society of Composers , Authors , and Publishers Pop Music Awards . Beyoncé was the third woman to have writing credits on three number one songs ( " Irreplaceable " , " Grillz " and " Check on It " ) in the same year , after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991 . She is tied with American songwriter Diane Warren at third with nine songwriting credits on number-one singles . ( The latter wrote her 9/11-motivated song " I Was Here " for 4 . ) In May 2011 , Billboard magazine listed Beyoncé at number 17 on their list of the " Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters " , for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . She was one of only three women on that list .
A move to " permanent daylight saving time " ( staying on summer hours all year with no time shifts ) is sometimes advocated , and has in fact been implemented in some jurisdictions such as Argentina , Chile , Iceland , Singapore , Uzbekistan and Belarus . Advocates cite the same advantages as normal DST without the problems associated with the twice yearly time shifts . However , many remain unconvinced of the benefits , citing the same problems and the relatively late sunrises , particularly in winter , that year-round DST entails . Russia switched to permanent DST from 2011 to 2014 , but the move proved unpopular because of the late sunrises in winter , so the country switched permanently back to " standard " or " winter " time in 2014 .
In 2004 , the Swaziland government acknowledged for the first time that it suffered an AIDS crisis , with 38.8 % of tested pregnant women infected with HIV ( see AIDS in Africa ) . The then Prime Minister Themba Dlamini declared a humanitarian crisis due to the combined effect of drought , land degradation , increased poverty , and HIV/AIDS . According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report , Swaziland is close to achieving universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment , defined as 80 % coverage or greater . Estimates of treatment coverage range from 70 % to 80 % of those infected . Life expectancy had fallen from 61 years in 2000 to 32 years in 2009 . Tuberculosis is also a significant problem , with an 18 % mortality rate . Many patients have a multi-drug resistant strain , and 83 % are co-infected with HIV .
Artifacts from the Paleolithic suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as early as 6,000 years ago . Lunar calendars were among the first to appear , either 12 or 13 lunar months ( either 354 or 384 days ) . Without intercalation to add days or months to some years , seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months . Lunisolar calendars have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year ( now known to be about 365.24 days ) and a year of just twelve lunar months . The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures , at least partly due to this relationship of months to years . Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica , particularly in ancient Mayan civilization . These calendars were religiously and astronomically based , with 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month .
The site of Richmond had been an important village of the Powhatan Confederacy , and was briefly settled by English colonists from Jamestown in 1609 , and in 1610–1611 . The present city of Richmond was founded in 1737 . It became the capital of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia in 1780 . During the Revolutionary War period , several notable events occurred in the city , including Patrick Henry 's " Give me liberty or give me death " speech in 1775 at St. John 's Church , and the passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom written by Thomas Jefferson . During the American Civil War , Richmond served as the capital of the Confederate States of America . The city entered the 20th century with one of the world 's first successful electric streetcar systems , as well as a national hub of African-American commerce and culture , the Jackson Ward neighborhood .
The culture of Greece has evolved over thousands of years , beginning in Mycenaean Greece and continuing most notably into Classical Greece , through the influence of the Roman Empire and its Greek Eastern continuation , the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire . Other cultures and nations , such as the Latin and Frankish states , the Ottoman Empire , the Venetian Republic , the Genoese Republic , and the British Empire have also left their influence on modern Greek culture , although historians credit the Greek War of Independence with revitalising Greece and giving birth to a single , cohesive entity of its multi-faceted culture .
In May 2014 , Oklahoma Director of Corrections , Robert Patton , recommended an indefinite hold on executions in the state after the botched execution of African-American Clayton Lockett . The prisoner had to be tasered to restrain him prior to the execution , and the lethal injection missed a vein in his groin , resulting in Lockett regaining consciousness , trying to get up , and to speak , before dying of a heart attack 43 minutes later , after the attempted execution had been called off . In 2015 , the state approved nitrogen asphyxiation as a method of execution .
The Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx is well known as one of the first transitional fossils to be found , and it provided support for the theory of evolution in the late 19th century . Archaeopteryx was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics : teeth , clawed fingers , and a long , lizard-like tail , as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds . It is not considered a direct ancestor of birds , though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor .
According to the scriptures , soon after the parinirvāṇa ( from Sanskrit : " highest extinguishment " ) of Gautama Buddha , the first Buddhist council was held . As with any ancient Indian tradition , transmission of teaching was done orally . The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teachings to ensure that no errors occurred in oral transmission . In the first council , Ānanda , a cousin of the Buddha and his personal attendant , was called upon to recite the discourses ( sūtras , Pāli suttas ) of the Buddha , and , according to some sources , the abhidhamma . Upāli , another disciple , recited the monastic rules ( vinaya ) . Most scholars regard the traditional accounts of the council as greatly exaggerated if not entirely fictitious . [ note 36 ] Richard Gombrich noted Sariputta led communal recitations of the Buddha 's teaching for preservation in the Buddha 's lifetime in Sangiti Sutta ( Digha Nikaya # 33 ) , and something similar to the First Council must have taken place to compose Buddhist scriptures .
The theories surrounding equal temperament began to be put in wider practice , especially as it enabled a wider range of chromatic possibilities in hard-to-tune keyboard instruments . Although Bach did not use equal temperament , as a modern piano is generally tuned , changes in the temperaments from the meantone system , common at the time , to various temperaments that made modulation between all keys musically acceptable , made possible Bach 's Well-Tempered Clavier .
The " yo yo " in the opinion polls continued into 1992 , though after November 1990 any Labour lead in the polls was rarely sufficient for a majority . Major resisted Kinnock 's calls for a general election throughout 1991 . Kinnock campaigned on the theme " It 's Time for a Change " , urging voters to elect a new government after more than a decade of unbroken Conservative rule . However , the Conservatives themselves had undergone a dramatic change in the change of leader from Thatcher to Major , at least in terms of style if not substance . From the outset , it was clearly a well-received change , as Labour 's 14-point lead in the November 1990 " Poll of Polls " was replaced by an 8 % Tory lead a month later .
Classified as a Subtropical Mediterranean climate ( Köppen Csb ) , Santa Monica enjoys an average of 310 days of sunshine a year . It is located in USDA plant hardiness zone 11a . Because of its location , nestled on the vast and open Santa Monica Bay , morning fog is a common phenomenon in May , June and early July ( caused by ocean temperature variations and currents ) . Like other inhabitants of the greater Los Angeles area , residents have a particular terminology for this phenomenon : the " May Gray " and the " June Gloom " . Overcast skies are common during June mornings , but usually the strong sun burns the fog off by noon . In the late winter/early summer , daily fog is a phenomenon too . It happens suddenly and it may last some hours or past sunset time . Nonetheless , it will sometimes stay cloudy and cool all day during June , even as other parts of the Los Angeles area enjoy sunny skies and warmer temperatures . At times , the sun can be shining east of 20th Street , while the beach area is overcast . As a general rule , the beach temperature is from 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit ( 3 to 6 degrees Celsius ) cooler than it is inland during summer days , and 5–10 degrees warmer during winter nights .
Hard rock had been established as a mainstream genre by 1965 . From the end of the 1960s , it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock , with both emerging as major radio formats in the US . Soft rock was often derived from folk rock , using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies . Major artists included Barbra Streisand , Carole King , Cat Stevens , James Taylor and Bread .
The BRA subsequently reevaluated its approach to urban renewal in its future projects , including the construction of Government Center . In 1965 , the first Community Health Center in the United States opened , the Columbia Point Health Center , in the Dorchester neighborhood . It mostly served the massive Columbia Point public housing complex adjoining it , which was built in 1953 . The health center is still in operation and was rededicated in 1990 as the Geiger-Gibson Community Health Center . The Columbia Point complex itself was redeveloped and revitalized into a mixed-income community called Harbor Point Apartments from 1984 to 1990 . By the 1970s , the city 's economy boomed after 30 years of economic downturn . A large number of high rises were constructed in the Financial District and in Boston 's Back Bay during this time period . This boom continued into the mid-1980s and later began again . Hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital , Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , and Brigham and Women 's Hospital lead the nation in medical innovation and patient care . Schools such as Boston College , Boston University , the Harvard Medical School , Northeastern University , Wentworth Institute of Technology , Berklee College of Music and Boston Conservatory attract students to the area . Nevertheless , the city experienced conflict starting in 1974 over desegregation busing , which resulted in unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s .
European maps continued to show this hypothesized land until Captain James Cook 's ships , HMS Resolution and Adventure , crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773 , in December 1773 and again in January 1774 . Cook came within about 120 km ( 75 mi ) of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice in January 1773 . The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica can be narrowed down to the crews of ships captained by three individuals . According to various organizations ( the National Science Foundation , NASA , the University of California , San Diego , and other sources ) , ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica or its ice shelf in 1820 : von Bellingshausen ( a captain in the Imperial Russian Navy ) , Edward Bransfield ( a captain in the Royal Navy ) , and Nathaniel Palmer ( a sealer out of Stonington , Connecticut ) . The expedition led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny reached a point within 32 km ( 20 mi ) from Queen Maud 's Land and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 69°21′28″S 2°14′50″W﻿ / ﻿69.35778°S 2.24722°W﻿ / -69.35778 ; -2.24722 , which became known as the Fimbul ice shelf . This happened three days before Bransfield sighted land , and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820 . The first documented landing on Antarctica was by the American sealer John Davis , apparently at Hughes Bay , near Cape Charles , in West Antarctica on 7 February 1821 , although some historians dispute this claim . The first recorded and confirmed landing was at Cape Adair in 1895 .
It is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400 . Nanjing remained the capital of the Ming Empire until 1421 , when the third emperor of the Ming dynasty , the Yongle Emperor , relocated the capital to Beijing .
The Mass of Paul VI was also in Latin but approval was given for the use of vernacular languages . There had been other instructions issued by the Pope in 1964 , 1967 , 1968 , 1969 and 1970 which centered on the reform of all liturgies of the Roman Church . These major reforms were not welcomed by all and in all countries . The sudden apparent " outlawing " of the 400-year-old Mass , the last typical edition of which being promulgated only a few years earlier in 1962 by Paul 's predecessor , Pope John XXIII , was not always explained well . Further experimentation with the new Mass by liturgists , such as the usage of pop/folk music ( as opposed to the Gregorian Chant advocated by Pope Pius X ) , along with concurrent changes in the order of sanctuaries , was viewed by some as vandalism . In 2007 , Pope Benedict XVI clarified that the 1962 Mass of John XXIII and the 1970 Mass of Paul VI are two forms of the same Roman Rite , the first , which had never been " juridically abrogated " , now being an " extraordinary form of the Roman Rite " , while the other " obviously is and continues to be the normal Form – the Forma ordinaria – of the Eucharistic Liturgy " .
Public institutions of higher education in Charleston include the College of Charleston ( the nation 's 13th-oldest university ) , The Citadel , The Military College of South Carolina , and the Medical University of South Carolina . The city is also home to private universities , including the Charleston School of Law . Charleston is also home to the Roper Hospital School of Practical Nursing , and the city has a downtown satellite campus for the region 's technical school , Trident Technical College . Charleston is also the location for the only college in the country that offers bachelor 's degrees in the building arts , The American College of the Building Arts . The Art Institute of Charleston , located downtown on North Market Street , opened in 2007 .
In England , one of the few licensed venues The Eclipse attracted people from up and down the country as it was open until the early hours . The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 was a government attempt to ban large rave dance events featuring music with " repetitive beats " . There were a number of abortive " Kill the Bill " demonstrations . The Spiral Tribe at Castle Morten was probably the nail in the coffin for illegal raves , and forced through the bill , which became law , in November 1994 . The music continued to grow and change , as typified by Leftfield with " Release the Pressure " , which introduced dub and reggae into the house sound , although Leftfield had prior releases , such as " Not Forgotten " released in 1990 on Sheffield 's Outer Rhythm records .
In 1781 , Immanuel Kant published the Critique of Pure Reason , one of the most influential works in the history of the philosophy of space and time . He describes time as an a priori notion that , together with other a priori notions such as space , allows us to comprehend sense experience . Kant denies that either space or time are substance , entities in themselves , or learned by experience ; he holds , rather , that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience . Spatial measurements are used to quantify how far apart objects are , and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between ( or duration of ) events . Although space and time are held to be transcendentally ideal in this sense , they are also empirically real—that is , not mere illusions .
The Muslims took control of the Island in 904 , after decades of fierce fighting , and the Emirate of Sicily was established . Muslim rule on the island lasted for about 120 years and was marked by cruelty and brutality against the native population , which was reduced into near slavery [ clarification needed ] and Christian churches across the island were all completely destroyed . [ page needed ] Palermo ( Balarm during Arab rule ) displaced Syracuse as the capital city of Sicily . It was said to have then begun to compete with Córdoba and Cairo in terms of importance and splendor . For more than one hundred years Palermo was the capital of a flourishing emirate . The Arabs also introduced many agricultural crops which remain a mainstay of Sicilian cuisine .
In April 2010 , Shell announced its intention to divest from downstream business of all African countries except South Africa and Egypt to Vitol and " Helios " . In several countries such as Tunisia , protests and strikes broke out . Shell denied rumours of the sellout . Shell continues however upstream activities/extracting crude oil in the oil-rich Niger Delta as well as downstream/commercial activities in South Africa . In June 2013 , the company announced a strategic review of its operations in Nigeria , hinting that assets could be divested . In August 2014 , the company disclosed it was in the process of finalizing the sale of its interests in four Nigerian oil fields .
Menzies ran strongly against Labor 's plans to nationalise the Australian banking system and , following victory in the 1949 election , secured a double dissolution election for April 1951 , after the Labor-controlled Senate refused to pass his banking legislation . The Liberal-Country Coalition was returned with control of the Senate . The Government was returned again in the 1954 election ; the formation of the anti-Communist Democratic Labor Party ( DLP ) and the consequent split in the Australian Labor Party early in 1955 helped the Liberals to another victory in December 1955 . John McEwen replaced Arthur Fadden as leader of the Country Party in March 1958 and the Menzies-McEwen Coalition was returned again at elections in November 1958 – their third victory against Labor 's H. V. Evatt . The Coalition was narrowly returned against Labor 's Arthur Calwell in the December 1961 election , in the midst of a credit squeeze . Menzies stood for office for the last time in the November 1963 election , again defeating Calwell , with the Coalition winning back its losses in the House of Representatives . Menzies went on to resign from parliament on 26 January 1966 .
It was believed that when people died , they would be confined to a gloomy world of Ereshkigal , whose realm was guarded by gateways with various monsters designed to prevent people entering or leaving . The dead were buried outside the city walls in graveyards where a small mound covered the corpse , along with offerings to monsters and a small amount of food . Those who could afford it sought burial at Dilmun . Human sacrifice was found in the death pits at the Ur royal cemetery where Queen Puabi was accompanied in death by her servants . It is also said that the Sumerians invented the first oboe-like instrument , and used them at royal funerals .
Historical aspects of the Expo line route are noteworthy . It uses the right-of-way for the Santa Monica Air Line that provided electric-powered freight and passenger service between Los Angeles and Santa Monica beginning in the 1920s . Service was discontinued in 1953 but diesel-powered freight deliveries to warehouses along the route continued until March 11 , 1988 . The abandonment of the line spurred concerns within the community and the entire right-of-way was purchased from Southern Pacific by Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority . The line was built in 1875 as the steam-powered Los Angeles and Independence Railroad to bring mining ore to ships in Santa Monica harbor and as a passenger excursion train to the beach .
Montini and Angelo Roncalli were considered to be friends , but when Roncalli , as Pope John XXIII announced a new Ecumenical Council , Cardinal Montini reacted with disbelief and said to Giulio Bevilacqua : " This old boy does not know what a hornets nest he is stirring up . " He was appointed to the Central Preparatory Commission in 1961 . During the Council , his friend Pope John XXIII asked him to live in the Vatican . He was a member of the Commission for Extraordinary Affairs but did not engage himself much into the floor debates on various issues . His main advisor was Monsignore Giovanni Colombo , whom he later appointed to be his successor in Milan The Commission was greatly overshadowed by the insistence of John XXIII to have the Council complete all its work in one single session before Christmas 1962 , to the 400th anniversary of the Council of Trent , an insistence which may have also been influenced by the Pope 's recent knowledge that he had cancer .
The major Allied participants were the United States , the Republic of China , the United Kingdom ( including the armed forces of British India , the Fiji Islands , Samoa , etc . ) , Australia , the Commonwealth of the Philippines , the Netherlands ( as the possessor of the Dutch East Indies and the western part of New Guinea ) , New Zealand , and Canada , all of whom were members of the Pacific War Council . Mexico , Free France and many other countries also took part , especially forces from other British colonies .
Between 10 and 17 October 1757 , a Hungarian general , Count András Hadik , serving in the Austrian army , executed what may be the most famous hussar action in history . When the Prussian King Frederick was marching south with his powerful armies , the Hungarian general unexpectedly swung his force of 5,000 , mostly hussars , around the Prussians and occupied part of their capital , Berlin , for one night . The city was spared for a negotiated ransom of 200,000 thalers . When Frederick heard about this humiliating occupation , he immediately sent a larger force to free the city . Hadik , however , left the city with his Hussars and safely reached the Austrian lines . Subsequently , Hadik was promoted to the rank of Marshal in the Austrian army .
The positions on the persistence of objects are somewhat similar . An endurantist holds that for an object to persist through time is for it to exist completely at different times ( each instance of existence we can regard as somehow separate from previous and future instances , though still numerically identical with them ) . A perdurantist on the other hand holds that for a thing to exist through time is for it to exist as a continuous reality , and that when we consider the thing as a whole we must consider an aggregate of all its " temporal parts " or instances of existing . Endurantism is seen as the conventional view and flows out of our pre-philosophical ideas ( when I talk to somebody I think I am talking to that person as a complete object , and not just a part of a cross-temporal being ) , but perdurantists have attacked this position . ( An example of a perdurantist is David Lewis . ) One argument perdurantists use to state the superiority of their view is that perdurantism is able to take account of change in objects .
The name " Seattle " appears on official Washington Territory papers dated May 23 , 1853 , when the first plats for the village were filed . In 1855 , nominal land settlements were established . On January 14 , 1865 , the Legislature of Territorial Washington incorporated the Town of Seattle with a board of trustees managing the city . The town of Seattle was disincorporated January 18 , 1867 and remained a mere precinct of King County until late 1869 , when a new petition was filed and the city was re-incorporated December 2 , 1869 with a Mayor-council government . The corporate seal of the City of Seattle carries the date " 1869 " and a likeness of Chief Sealth in left profile .
One of the first recorded instances of translation in the West was the rendering of the Old Testament into Greek in the 3rd century BCE . The translation is known as the " Septuagint " , a name that refers to the seventy translators ( seventy-two , in some versions ) who were commissioned to translate the Bible at Alexandria , Egypt . Each translator worked in solitary confinement in his own cell , and according to legend all seventy versions proved identical . The Septuagint became the source text for later translations into many languages , including Latin , Coptic , Armenian and Georgian .
The Immaculate Collection , Madonna 's first greatest-hits compilation album , was released in November 1990 . It included two new songs , " Justify My Love " and " Rescue Me " . The album was certified diamond by RIAA and sold over 30 million copies worldwide , becoming the best-selling compilation album by a solo artist in history . " Justify My Love " reached number one in the U.S. and top ten worldwide . Its music video featured scenes of sadomasochism , bondage , same-sex kissing , and brief nudity . The video was deemed too sexually explicit for MTV and was banned from the network . Madonna responded to the banning : " Why is it that people are willing to go and watch a movie about someone getting blown to bits for no reason at all , and nobody wants to see two girls kissing and two men snuggling ? "
There are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works however that Avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion . He did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory , if prophecy could be questioned , and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly , without digressing to consider epistemological matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers .
In 2010 , there were concerns among Tajik officials that Islamic militarism in the east of the country was on the rise following the escape of 25 militants from a Tajik prison in August , an ambush that killed 28 Tajik soldiers in the Rasht Valley in September , and another ambush in the valley in October that killed 30 soldiers , followed by fighting outside Gharm that left 3 militants dead . To date the country 's Interior Ministry asserts that the central government maintains full control over the country 's east , and the military operation in the Rasht Valley was concluded in November 2010 . However , fighting erupted again in July 2012 . In 2015 Russia will send more troops to Tajikistan , as confirmed by a report of STRATFOR ( magazine online )
After the Revolution of 1979 , as the new government imposed new laws and standards , a new age in Iranian cinema emerged , starting with Viva ... by Khosrow Sinai and followed by many other directors , such as Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panahi . Kiarostami , an admired Iranian director , planted Iran firmly on the map of world cinema when he won the Palme d'Or for Taste of Cherry in 1997 . The continuous presence of Iranian films in prestigious international festivals , such as the Cannes Film Festival , the Venice Film Festival , and the Berlin International Film Festival , attracted world attention to Iranian masterpieces . In 2006 , six Iranian films , of six different styles , represented Iranian cinema at the Berlin International Film Festival . Critics considered this a remarkable event in the history of Iranian cinema .
By the mid-18th century , Charles Town had become a bustling trade center , the hub of the Atlantic trade for the southern colonies . Charles Towne was also the wealthiest and largest city south of Philadelphia , in part because of the lucrative slave trade . By 1770 , it was the fourth-largest port in the colonies , after Boston , New York , and Philadelphia , with a population of 11,000—slightly more than half of them slaves . By 1708 , the majority of the colony 's population was slaves , and the future state would continue to be a majority of African descent until after the Great Migration of the early 20th century .
In January 2016 , the Eton College beagling club was accused by the League Against Cruel Sports of undertaking an illegal hare hunt . The allegations were accompanied by a video of the Eton Beagles chasing a hare , as 'the hunt staff urge the beagles on and make no efforts to call the dogs off . ' A spokesman representing Eton College released the following statement : " Eton College takes its legal responsibilities extremely seriously and expects all school activities to comply with the law . We are investigating this allegation as a matter of urgency and will be co-operating fully with the relevant authorities . "
In 1768 Russian-backed Ukrainian Haidamaks , pursuing Polish confederates , entered Balta , an Ottoman-controlled town on the border of Bessarabia in Ukraine , and massacred its citizens and burned the town to the ground . This action provoked the Ottoman Empire into the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774 . The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca of 1774 ended the war and provided freedom to worship for the Christian citizens of the Ottoman-controlled provinces of Wallachia and Moldavia . By the late 18th century , a number of defeats in several wars with Russia led some people in the Ottoman Empire to conclude that the reforms of Peter the Great had given the Russians an edge , and the Ottomans would have to keep up with Western technology in order to avoid further defeats .
Several Germanic tribes celebrated the returning of the daylight . A predominant deity was during this jubilee driven around in a noisy procession on a ship on wheels . The winter would be driven out , to make sure that fertility could return in spring . A central figure was possibly the fertility goddess Nerthus . Also there are some indications that the effigy of Nerthus or Freyr was placed on a ship with wheels and accompanied by a procession of people in animal disguise and men in women 's clothes . Aboard the ship would the marriage of a man and woman be consummated as a fertility ritual .
Note : Besides ethnic groups , Slavs often identify themselves with the local geographical region in which they live . Some of the major regional South Slavic groups include : Zagorci in northern Croatia , Istrijani in westernmost Croatia , Dalmatinci in southern Croatia , Boduli in Adriatic islands , Vlaji in hinterland of Dalmatia , Slavonci in eastern Croatia , Bosanci in Bosnia , Hercegovci in Herzegovina , Krajišnici in western Bosnia , but is more commonly used to refer to the Serbs of Croatia , most of whom are descendants of the Grenzers , and continued to live in the area which made up the Military Frontier until the Croatian war of independence , Semberci in northeast Bosnia , Srbijanci in Serbia proper , Šumadinci in central Serbia , Vojvođani in northern Serbia , Sremci in Syrmia , Bačvani in northwest Vojvodina , Banaćani in Banat , Sandžaklije ( Muslims in Serbia/Montenegro border ) , Kosovci in Kosovo , Bokelji in southwest Montenegro , Trakiytsi in Upper Thracian Lowlands , Dobrudzhantsi in north-east Bulgarian region , Balkandzhii in Central Balkan Mountains , Miziytsi in north Bulgarian region , Warmiaks and Masurians in north-east Polish regions Warmia and Mazuria , Pirintsi in Blagoevgrad Province , Ruptsi in the Rhodopes etc .
Early Presbyterians were careful to distinguish between the " church , " which referred the members , and the " meeting house , " which was the building in which the church met . Until the late 19th century , very few Presbyterians ever referred to their buildings as " churches . " Presbyterians believed that meeting-houses ( now called churches ) are buildings to support the worship of God . The decor in some instances was austere so as not to detract from worship . Early Presbyterian meeting-houses were extremely plain . No stained glass , no elaborate furnishings , and no images were to be found in the meeting-house . The pulpit , often raised so as only to be accessible by a staircase , was the centerpiece of the building .
Arsenal was the first club from the south of England to join The Football League , in 1893 . They entered the First Division in 1904 , and have since accumulated the second most points . Relegated only once , in 1913 , they continue the longest streak in the top division . In the 1930s , Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups , and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war . In 1970–71 , they won their first League and FA Cup Double . Between 1988 and 2005 , they won five League titles and five FA Cups , including two more Doubles . They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position .
The beginning of the Neolithic culture is considered to be in the Levant ( Jericho , modern-day West Bank ) about 10,200 – 8,800 BC . It developed directly from the Epipaleolithic Natufian culture in the region , whose people pioneered the use of wild cereals , which then evolved into true farming . The Natufian period was between 12,000 and 10,200 BC , and the so-called " proto-Neolithic " is now included in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic ( PPNA ) between 10,200 and 8,800 BC . As the Natufians had become dependent on wild cereals in their diet , and a sedentary way of life had begun among them , the climatic changes associated with the Younger Dryas are thought to have forced people to develop farming .
The city hosted the 2010 Commonwealth Games and annually hosts Delhi Half Marathon foot-race . The city has previously hosted the 1951 Asian Games and the 1982 Asian Games . New Delhi was interested in bidding for the 2019 Asian Games but was turned down by the government on 2 August 2010 amid allegations of corruption in 2010 Commonwealth Games .
Stadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs . For the 2009–10 season , average attendances across the league clubs were 34,215 for Premier League matches with a total aggregate attendance figure of 13,001,616 . This represents an increase of 13,089 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the league 's first season ( 1992–93 ) . However , during the 1992–93 season the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Report 's 1994–95 deadline for all-seater stadiums . The Premier League 's record average attendance of 36,144 was set during the 2007–08 season . This record was then beaten in the 2013–14 season recording an average attendance of 36,695 with a total attendance of just under 14 million , the highest average in England 's top flight since 1950 .
Approximately 12 million Africans were shipped to the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade from 1492 to 1888 , with 11.5 million of those shipped to South America and the Caribbean . Brazil was the largest importer in the Americas , with 5.5 million African slaves imported , followed by the British Caribbean with 2.76 million , the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland with 1.59 million Africans , and the French Caribbean with 1.32 million . Today their descendants number approximately 150 million in South America and the Caribbean . In addition to skin color , other physical characteristics such as facial features and hair texture are often variously used in classifying peoples as black in South America and the Caribbean . In South America and the Caribbean , classification as black is also closely tied to social status and socioeconomic variables , especially in light of social conceptions of " blanqueamiento " ( racial whitening ) and related concepts .
The city proper is home to less than one-thirteenth of the population of South Florida . Miami is the 42nd-most populous city in the United States . The Miami metropolitan area , which includes Miami-Dade , Broward and Palm Beach counties , had a combined population of more than 5.5 million people , ranked seventh largest in the United States , and is the largest metropolitan area in the Southeastern United States . As of 2008 [ update ] , the United Nations estimates that the Miami Urban Agglomeration is the 44th-largest in the world .
The iPod line can play several audio file formats including MP3 , AAC/M4A , Protected AAC , AIFF , WAV , Audible audiobook , and Apple Lossless . The iPod photo introduced the ability to display JPEG , BMP , GIF , TIFF , and PNG image file formats . Fifth and sixth generation iPod Classics , as well as third generation iPod Nanos , can additionally play MPEG-4 ( H.264/MPEG-4 AVC ) and QuickTime video formats , with restrictions on video dimensions , encoding techniques and data-rates . Originally , iPod software only worked with Mac OS ; iPod software for Microsoft Windows was launched with the second generation model . Unlike most other media players , Apple does not support Microsoft 's WMA audio format—but a converter for WMA files without Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) is provided with the Windows version of iTunes . MIDI files also can not be played , but can be converted to audio files using the " Advanced " menu in iTunes . Alternative open-source audio formats , such as Ogg Vorbis and FLAC , are not supported without installing custom firmware onto an iPod ( e.g. , Rockbox ) .
Antonio Vivaldi composed a mandolin concerto ( Concerto in C major Op.3 6 ) and two concertos for two mandolins and orchestra . Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart placed it in his 1787 work Don Giovanni and Beethoven created four variations of it . Antonio Maria Bononcini composed La conquista delle Spagne di Scipione Africano il giovane in 1707 and George Frideric Handel composed Alexander Balus in 1748 . Others include Giovani Battista Gervasio ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Giuseppe Giuliano ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Emanuele Barbella ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Domenico Scarlatti ( Sonata n.54 ( K.89 ) in D minor for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , and Addiego Guerra ( Sonata in G major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) .
Lee and Guenther have rejected most of the arguments put forward by Wilmsen . Doron Shultziner and others have argued that we can learn a lot about the life-styles of prehistoric hunter-gatherers from studies of contemporary hunter-gatherers—especially their impressive levels of egalitarianism .
The Victorian era in particular became notorious for the conditions under which children were employed . Children as young as four were employed in production factories and mines working long hours in dangerous , often fatal , working conditions . In coal mines , children would crawl through tunnels too narrow and low for adults . Children also worked as errand boys , crossing sweepers , shoe blacks , or selling matches , flowers and other cheap goods . Some children undertook work as apprentices to respectable trades , such as building or as domestic servants ( there were over 120,000 domestic servants in London in the mid-18th century ) . Working hours were long : builders worked 64 hours a week in summer and 52 in winter , while domestic servants worked 80 hour weeks .
The army 's major campaign against the Indians was fought in Florida against Seminoles . It took long wars ( 1818–58 ) to finally defeat the Seminoles and move them to Oklahoma . The usual strategy in Indian wars was to seize control of the Indians winter food supply , but that was no use in Florida where there was no winter . The second strategy was to form alliances with other Indian tribes , but that too was useless because the Seminoles had destroyed all the other Indians when they entered Florida in the late eighteenth century .
Popper left school at the age of 16 and attended lectures in mathematics , physics , philosophy , psychology and the history of music as a guest student at the University of Vienna . In 1919 , Popper became attracted by Marxism and subsequently joined the Association of Socialist School Students . He also became a member of the Social Democratic Workers ' Party of Austria , which was at that time a party that fully adopted the Marxist ideology . After the street battle in the Hörlgasse on 15 June 1919 , when police shot eight of his unarmed party comrades , he became disillusioned by what he saw to be the " pseudo-scientific " historical materialism of Marx , abandoned the ideology , and remained a supporter of social liberalism throughout his life .
Saint Valentine , a Roman Catholic Bishop or priest who was martyred in about 296 AD , seems to have had no known connection with romantic love , but the day of his martyrdom on the Roman Catholic calendar , Saint Valentine 's Day ( February 14 ) , became , in the 14th century , an occasion for lovers to send messages to each other . In recent years the celebration of Saint Valentine ' s day has spread beyond Christian countries to Japan and China and other parts of the world . The celebration of Saint Valentine 's Day is forbidden or strongly condemned in many Islamic countries , including Saudi Arabia , Pakistan and Iran . In Saudi Arabia , in 2002 and 2011 , religious police banned the sale of all Valentine 's Day items , telling shop workers to remove any red items , as the day is considered a Christian holiday .
While asthma is a well recognized condition , there is not one universal agreed upon definition . It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as " a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role . The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing , breathlessness , chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning . These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment " .
John 's personal life greatly affected his reign . Contemporary chroniclers state that John was sinfully lustful and lacking in piety . It was common for kings and nobles of the period to keep mistresses , but chroniclers complained that John 's mistresses were married noblewomen , which was considered unacceptable . John had at least five children with mistresses during his first marriage to Isabelle of Gloucester , and two of those mistresses are known to have been noblewomen . John 's behaviour after his second marriage to Isabella of Angoulême is less clear , however . None of John 's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried , and there is no actual documentary proof of adultery after that point , although John certainly had female friends amongst the court throughout the period . The specific accusations made against John during the baronial revolts are now generally considered to have been invented for the purposes of justifying the revolt ; nonetheless , most of John 's contemporaries seem to have held a poor opinion of his sexual behaviour .

After World War I the US Army started developing a dual-role ( AA/ground ) automatic 37 mm cannon , designed by John M. Browning . It was standardised in 1927 as the T9 AA cannon , but trials quickly revealed that it was worthless in the ground role . However , while the shell was a bit light ( well under 2 lbs ) it had a good effective ceiling and fired 125 rounds per minute ; an AA carriage was developed and it entered service in 1939 . The Browning 37mm proved prone to jamming , and was eventually replaced in AA units by the Bofors 40 mm . The Bofors had attracted attention from the US Navy , but none were acquired before 1939 . Also , in 1931 the US Army worked on a mobile anti-aircraft machine mount on the back of a heavy truck having four .30 caliber water-cooled machine guns and an optical director . It proved unsuccessful and was abandoned .
In March 2003 , a second rebel group , Movement for Democracy in Liberia , began launching attacks against Taylor from the southeast . Peace talks between the factions began in Accra in June of that year , and Taylor was indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone for crimes against humanity that same month . By July 2003 , the rebels had launched an assault on Monrovia . Under heavy pressure from the international community and the domestic Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace movement , Taylor resigned in August 2003 and went into exile in Nigeria .
The climate of Cork , like the rest of Ireland , is mild and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes . Cork lies in plant Hardiness zone 9b . Met Éireann maintains a climatological weather station at Cork Airport , a few kilometres south of the city . It should be noted that the airport is at an altitude of 151 metres ( 495 ft ) and temperatures can often differ by a few degrees between the airport and the city itself . There are also smaller synoptic weather stations at UCC and Clover Hill .
New York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world by the diplomatic consulates of Iceland and Latvia and by New York 's Baruch College . A book containing a series of essays titled New York , culture capital of the world , 1940–1965 has also been published as showcased by the National Library of Australia . In describing New York , author Tom Wolfe said , " Culture just seems to be in the air , like part of the weather . "
The 'OtherOS ' functionality was not present in the updated PS Slim models , and the feature was subsequently removed from previous versions of the PS3 as part of the machine 's firmware update version 3.21 which was released on April 1 , 2010 ; Sony cited security concerns as the rationale . The firmware update 3.21 was mandatory for access to the PlayStation Network . The removal caused some controversy ; as the update removed officially advertised features from already sold products , and gave rise to several class action lawsuits aimed at making Sony return the feature or provide compensation .
In most taxonomies , the flowering plants are treated as a coherent group . The most popular descriptive name has been Angiospermae ( Angiosperms ) , with Anthophyta ( " flowering plants " ) a second choice . These names are not linked to any rank . The Wettstein system and the Engler system use the name Angiospermae , at the assigned rank of subdivision . The Reveal system treated flowering plants as subdivision Magnoliophytina ( Frohne & U. Jensen ex Reveal , Phytologia 79 : 70 1996 ) , but later split it to Magnoliopsida , Liliopsida , and Rosopsida . The Takhtajan system and Cronquist system treat this group at the rank of division , leading to the name Magnoliophyta ( from the family name Magnoliaceae ) . The Dahlgren system and Thorne system ( 1992 ) treat this group at the rank of class , leading to the name Magnoliopsida . The APG system of 1998 , and the later 2003 and 2009 revisions , treat the flowering plants as a clade called angiosperms without a formal botanical name . However , a formal classification was published alongside the 2009 revision in which the flowering plants form the Subclass Magnoliidae .
The International Association for the Study of Pain advocates that the relief of pain should be recognized as a human right , that chronic pain should be considered a disease in its own right , and that pain medicine should have the full status of a specialty . It is a specialty only in China and Australia at this time . Elsewhere , pain medicine is a subspecialty under disciplines such as anesthesiology , physiatry , neurology , palliative medicine and psychiatry . In 2011 , Human Rights Watch alerted that tens of millions of people worldwide are still denied access to inexpensive medications for severe pain .
On March 30 , 2015 , it was announced that West is a co-owner , with various other music artists , in the music streaming service Tidal . The service specialises in lossless audio and high definition music videos . Jay Z acquired the parent company of Tidal , Aspiro , in the first quarter of 2015 . Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z , sixteen artist stakeholders ( such as Rihanna , Beyoncé , Madonna , Chris Martin , Nicki Minaj and more ) co-own Tidal , with the majority owning a 3 % equity stake . The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry , and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify , which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties . " The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again , to recognize its value " , stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal .
Eleven days after Orsini 's assassination attempt in France , Victoria 's eldest daughter married Prince Frederick William of Prussia in London . They had been betrothed since September 1855 , when Princess Victoria was 14 years old ; the marriage was delayed by the Queen and Prince Albert until the bride was 17 . The Queen and Albert hoped that their daughter and son-in-law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging Prussian state . Victoria felt " sick at heart " to see her daughter leave England for Germany ; " It really makes me shudder " , she wrote to Princess Victoria in one of her frequent letters , " when I look round to all your sweet , happy , unconscious sisters , and think I must give them up too – one by one . " Almost exactly a year later , Princess Victoria gave birth to the Queen 's first grandchild , Wilhelm , who would become the last German Kaiser .
The Pocitos district , near the beach of the same name , has many homes built by Bello and Reboratti between 1920 and 1940 , with a mixture of styles . Other landmarks in Pocitos are the " Edificio Panamericano " designed by Raul Sichero , and the " Positano " and " El Pilar " designed by Adolfo Sommer Smith and Luis García Pardo in the 1950s and 1960s . However , the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the face of this neighbourhood , with a cluster of modern apartment buildings for upper and upper middle class residents .

Eritrea 's ethnic groups each have their own styles of music and accompanying dances . Amongst the Tigrinya , the best known traditional musical genre is the guaila . Traditional instruments of Eritrean folk music include the stringed krar , kebero , begena , masenqo and the wata ( a distant/rudimentary cousin of the violin ) . The most popular Eritrean artist is the Tigrinya singer Helen Meles , who is noted for her powerful voice and wide singing range . Other prominent local musicians include the Kunama singer Dehab Faytinga , Ruth Abraha , Bereket Mengisteab , Yemane Baria , and the late Abraham Afewerki .
In 1975 , a group of Chicago Cubs fans based in Washington , D.C. formed the Emil Verban Society . The society is a select club of high profile Cub fans , currently headed by Illinois Senator Dick Durbin which is named for Emil Verban , who in three seasons with the Cubs in the 1940s batted .280 with 39 runs batted in and one home run . Verban was picked as the epitome of a Cub player , explains columnist George Will , because " He exemplified mediocrity under pressure , he was competent but obscure and typifying of the work ethics . " Verban initially believed he was being ridiculed , but his ill feeling disappeared several years later when he was flown to Washington to meet President Ronald Reagan , also a society member , at the White House . Hillary Clinton , Jim Belushi , Joe Mantegna , Rahm Emanuel , Dick Cheney and many others have been included among its membership .
The first few naval battles were disasters for Rome . However , after training more sailors and inventing a grappling engine , a Roman naval force was able to defeat a Carthaginian fleet , and further naval victories followed . The Carthaginians then hired Xanthippus of Carthage , a Spartan mercenary general , to reorganise and lead their army . He cut off the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy . The Romans then again defeated the Carthaginians in naval battle at the Battle of the Aegates Islands and left Carthage with neither a fleet nor sufficient coin to raise one . For a maritime power the loss of their access to the Mediterranean stung financially and psychologically , and the Carthaginians sued for peace .
Roncalli was summoned to the final ballot of the conclave at 4:00 pm . He was elected pope at 4:30 pm with a total of 38 votes . After the long pontificate of Pope Pius XII , the cardinals chose a man who – it was presumed because of his advanced age – would be a short-term or " stop-gap " pope . They wished to choose a candidate who would do little during the new pontificate . Upon his election , Cardinal Eugene Tisserant asked him the ritual questions of whether he would accept and if so , what name he would take for himself . Roncalli gave the first of his many surprises when he chose " John " as his regnal name . Roncalli 's exact words were " I will be called John " . This was the first time in over 500 years that this name had been chosen ; previous popes had avoided its use since the time of the Antipope John XXIII during the Western Schism several centuries before .
Barça 's local rival has always been Espanyol . Blanc-i-blaus , being one of the clubs granted royal patronage , was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans , unlike the multinational nature of Barça 's primary board . The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona , and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners . The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid . Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià .
A year before Alfonso III " the Great " of Asturias death , three of Alfonso 's sons rose in rebellion and forced him to abdicate , partitioning the kingdom among them . The eldest son , García , became king of León . The second son , Ordoño , reigned in Galicia , while the third , Fruela , received Asturias with Oviedo as his capital . Alfonso died in Zamora , probably in 910 . His former realm would be reunited when first García died childless and León passed to Ordoño . He in turn died when his children were too young to ascend ; Fruela became king of a reunited crown . His death the next year initiated a series of internecine struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century . It continued under that name [ clarification needed ] until incorporated into the Kingdom of Castile in 1230 , after Ferdinand III became joint king of the two kingdoms . This was done to avoid dynastic feuds and to maintain the Christian Kingdoms strong enough to prevent complete Muslim take over of the Iberian Peninsula and to further the Reconquista of Iberia by Christian armies .
Another major addition to the city 's museum scene is the Museum of Remembrance and Tolerance ( Museo de la Memoria y Tolerancia ) , inaugurated in early 2011 . The brainchild of two young Mexican women as a Holocaust museum , the idea morphed into a unique museum dedicated to showcasing all major historical events of discrimination and genocide . Permanent exhibits include those on the Holocaust and other large-scale atrocities . It also houses temporary exhibits ; one on Tibet was inaugurated by the Dalai Lama in September 2011 .
During the 19th and 20th century , many national political parties organized themselves into international organizations along similar policy lines . Notable examples are The Universal Party , International Workingmen 's Association ( also called the First International ) , the Socialist International ( also called the Second International ) , the Communist International ( also called the Third International ) , and the Fourth International , as organizations of working class parties , or the Liberal International ( yellow ) , Hizb ut-Tahrir , Christian Democratic International and the International Democrat Union ( blue ) . Organized in Italy in 1945 , the International Communist Party , since 1974 headquartered in Florence has sections in six countries . [ citation needed ] Worldwide green parties have recently established the Global Greens . The Universal Party , The Socialist International , the Liberal International , and the International Democrat Union are all based in London . Some administrations ( e.g . Hong Kong ) outlaw formal linkages between local and foreign political organizations , effectively outlawing international political parties .
Other pre-modern Chinese names for Tibet include Wusiguo ( Chinese : 烏斯國 ; pinyin : Wūsīguó ; cf . Tibetan dbus , Ü , [ wyʔ˨˧˨ ] ) , Wusizang ( Chinese : 烏斯藏 ; pinyin : wūsīzàng , cf . Tibetan dbus-gtsang , Ü-Tsang ) , Tubote ( Chinese : 圖伯特 ; pinyin : Túbótè ) , and Tanggute ( Chinese : 唐古忒 ; pinyin : Tánggǔtè , cf . Tangut ) . American Tibetologist Elliot Sperling has argued in favor of a recent tendency by some authors writing in Chinese to revive the term Tubote ( simplified Chinese : 图伯特 ; traditional Chinese : 圖伯特 ; pinyin : Túbótè ) for modern use in place of Xizang , on the grounds that Tubote more clearly includes the entire Tibetan plateau rather than simply the Tibet Autonomous Region .

In recent decades , the literacy rate of Rajasthan has increased significantly . In 1991 , the state 's literacy rate was only 38.55 % ( 54.99 % male and 20.44 % female ) . In 2001 , the literacy rate increased to 60.41 % ( 75.70 % male and 43.85 % female ) . This was the highest leap in the percentage of literacy recorded in India ( the rise in female literacy being 23 % ) . At the Census 2011 , Rajasthan had a literacy rate of 67.06 % ( 80.51 % male and 52.66 % female ) . Although Rajasthan 's literacy rate is below the national average of 74.04 % and although its female literacy rate is the lowest in the country , the state has been praised for its efforts and achievements in raising male and female literacy rates .
The polyphony of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century , with compositions by Josquin des Prez . The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument , although this instrument would merely double the singers ' parts and was not independent . By the 16th century , a cappella polyphony had further developed , but gradually , the cantata began to take the place of a cappella forms . 16th century a cappella polyphony , nonetheless , continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day . Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina , such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ " doubling " some or all of the voices . Such is seen in the life of Palestrina becoming a major influence on Bach , most notably in the aforementioned Mass in B Minor . Other composers that utilized the a cappella style , if only for the occasional piece , were Claudio Monteverdi and his masterpiece , Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata ( A lover 's tears at his beloved 's grave ) , which was composed in 1610 , and Andrea Gabrieli when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces , one of which was in the unaccompanied style . Learning from the preceding two composeres , Heinrich Schütz utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces , chief among these were the pieces in the oratorio style , which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week , such as Christ 's suffering and the Passion . Five of Schutz 's Historien were Easter pieces , and of these the latter three , which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints , those of Matthew , Luke and John , were all done a cappella style . This was a near requirement for this type of piece , and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted parts from either Christ or the authors were performed in a plainchant .
The forests play a vital role in harbouring more than 45,000 floral and 81,000 faunal species of which 5150 floral and 1837 faunal species are endemic . Plant and animal species confined to a specific geographical area are called endemic species . In reserved forests , rights to activities like hunting and grazing are sometimes given to communities living on the fringes of the forest , who sustain their livelihood partially or wholly from forest resources or products . The unclassed forests covers 6.4 percent of the total forest area and they are marked by the following characteristics :
The strength of beers has climbed during the later years of the 20th century . Vetter 33 , a 10.5 % abv ( 33 degrees Plato , hence Vetter " 33 " ) doppelbock , was listed in the 1994 Guinness Book of World Records as the strongest beer at that time , though Samichlaus , by the Swiss brewer Hürlimann , had also been listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the strongest at 14 % abv . Since then , some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers . Samuel Adams reached 20 % abv with Millennium , and then surpassed that amount to 25.6 % abv with Utopias . The strongest beer brewed in Britain was Baz 's Super Brew by Parish Brewery , a 23 % abv beer . In September 2011 , the Scottish brewery BrewDog produced Ghost Deer , which , at 28 % , they claim to be the world 's strongest beer produced by fermentation alone .
The character of New York 's large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses and townhouses and shabby tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930 . In contrast , New York City also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings . In neighborhoods such as Riverdale ( in the Bronx ) , Ditmas Park ( in Brooklyn ) , and Douglaston ( in Queens ) , large single-family homes are common in various architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian .
The Cherokee Nation instigated a 10-year language preservation plan that involved growing new fluent speakers of the Cherokee language from childhood on up through school immersion programs as well as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home . This plan was part of an ambitious goal that in 50 years , 80 % or more of the Cherokee people will be fluent in the language . The Cherokee Preservation Foundation has invested $ 3 million into opening schools , training teachers , and developing curricula for language education , as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used . There is a Cherokee language immersion school in Tahlequah , Oklahoma that educates students from pre-school through eighth grade . Graduates are fluent speakers of the language . Several universities offer Cherokee as a second language , including the University of Oklahoma and Northeastern State University .
Manhattan was on track to have an estimated 90,000 hotel rooms at the end of 2014 , a 10 % increase from 2013 . In October 2014 , the Anbang Insurance Group , based in China , purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US $ 1.95 billion , making it the world 's most expensive hotel ever sold .
From 1898 , it was commonly accepted that the name was of Celtic origin and meant place belonging to a man called *Londinos ; this explanation has since been rejected . Richard Coates put forward an explanation in 1998 that it is derived from the pre-Celtic Old European * ( p ) lowonida , meaning 'river too wide to ford ' , and suggested that this was a name given to the part of the River Thames which flows through London ; from this , the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name , *Lowonidonjon ; this requires quite a serious amendment however . The ultimate difficulty lies in reconciling the Latin form Londinium with the modern Welsh Llundain , which should demand a form * ( h ) lōndinion ( as opposed to *londīnion ) , from earlier *loundiniom . The possibility can not be ruled out that the Welsh name was borrowed back in from English at a later date , and thus can not be used as a basis from which to reconstruct the original name .
In Texas , English is the state 's de facto official language ( though it lacks de jure status ) and is used in government . However , the continual influx of Spanish-speaking immigrants increased the import of Spanish in Texas . Texas 's counties bordering Mexico are mostly Hispanic , and consequently , Spanish is commonly spoken in the region . The Government of Texas , through Section 2054.116 of the Government Code , mandates that state agencies provide information on their websites in Spanish to assist residents who have limited English proficiency .
The population of the region is 14 million spread across eight countries . On the rim of the mountains , on the plateaus and the plains the economy consists of manufacturing and service jobs whereas in the higher altitudes and in the mountains farming is still essential to the economy . Farming and forestry continue to be mainstays of Alpine culture , industries that provide for export to the cities and maintain the mountain ecology .
Nishimura 's force consisted of two battleships , one cruiser and four destroyers . Because they were observing radio silence , Nishimura was unable to synchronize with Shima and Kurita . Nishimura and Shima had failed to even coordinate their plans before the attacks – they were long-time rivals and neither wished to have anything to do with the other . When he entered the narrow Surigao Strait at about 02:00 , Shima was 22 miles ( 40 km ) behind him , and Kurita was still in the Sibuyan Sea , several hours from the beaches at Leyte . As they passed Panaon Island , Nishimura 's force ran into a trap set for them by the U.S.-Australian 7th Fleet Support Force . R. Adm. Jesse Oldendorf had six battleships , four heavy cruisers , four light cruisers , 29 destroyers and 39 PT boats . To pass the strait and reach the landings , Nishimura had to run the gauntlet . At about 03:00 the Japanese battleship Fusō and three destroyers were hit by torpedoes and Fusō broke in two . At 03:50 the U.S. battleships opened fire . Radar fire control meant they could hit targets from a much greater distance than the Japanese . The battleship Yamashiro , a cruiser and a destroyer were crippled by 16-inch ( 406 mm ) shells ; Yamashiro sank at 04:19 . Only one of Nishimura 's force of seven ships survived the engagement . At 04:25 Shima 's force of two cruisers and eight destroyers reached the battle . Seeing Fusō and believing her to be the wrecks of two battleships , Shima ordered a retreat , ending the last battleship-vs-battleship action in history .
There were guilds of dyers who specialized in red in Venice and other large Europeans cities . The Rubia plant was used to make the most common dye ; it produced an orange-red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans . For the wealthy , the dye used was Kermes , made from a tiny scale insect which fed on the branches and leaves of the oak tree . For those with even more money there was Polish Cochineal ; also known as Kermes vermilio or " Blood of Saint John " , which was made from a related insect , the Margodes polonicus . It made a more vivid red than ordinary Kermes . The finest and most expensive variety of red made from insects was the " Kermes " of Armenia ( Armenian cochineal , also known as Persian kirmiz ) , made by collecting and crushing Porphyophora hamelii , an insect which lived on the roots and stems of certain grasses . The pigment and dye merchants of Venice imported and sold all of these products and also manufactured their own color , called Venetian red , which was considered the most expensive and finest red in Europe . Its secret ingredient was arsenic , which brightened the color .
Emerging British acts included Free , who released their signature song " All Right Now " ( 1970 ) , which has received extensive radio airplay in both the UK and US . After the breakup of the band in 1973 , vocalist Paul Rodgers joined supergroup Bad Company , whose eponymous first album ( 1974 ) was an international hit . The mixture of hard rock and progressive rock , evident in the works of Deep Purple , was pursued more directly by bands like Uriah Heep and Argent . Scottish band Nazareth released their self-titled début album in 1971 , producing a blend of hard rock and pop that would culminate in their best selling , Hair of the Dog ( 1975 ) , which contained the proto-power ballad " Love Hurts " . Having enjoyed some national success in the early 1970s , Queen , after the release of Sheer Heart Attack ( 1974 ) and A Night at the Opera ( 1975 ) , gained international recognition with a sound that used layered vocals and guitars and mixed hard rock with heavy metal , progressive rock , and even opera . The latter featured the single " Bohemian Rhapsody " , which stayed at number one in the UK charts for nine weeks .
Originating as a popular form of entertainment in 19th-century Europe and later as a sideshow exhibition in North American traveling carnivals and vaudeville halls , professional wrestling grew into a standalone genre of entertainment with many diverse variations in cultures around the globe , and is now considered a multimillion-dollar entertainment industry . While it has greatly declined in Europe , in North America it has experienced several different periods of prominent cultural popularity during its century and a half of existence . The advent of television gave professional wrestling a new outlet , and wrestling ( along with boxing ) was instrumental in making pay-per-view a viable method of content delivery .
Most Western languages ( particularly those with writing systems based on the Latin , Cyrillic , Greek , Coptic , and Armenian alphabets ) use letter cases in their written form as an aid to clarity . Scripts using two separate cases are also called bicameral scripts . Many other writing systems make no distinction between majuscules and minuscules – a system called unicameral script or unicase . This includes most syllabic and other non-alphabetic scripts . The Georgian alphabet is special since it used to be bicameral , but today is mostly used in a unicameral way .
Artifacts from the Paleolithic suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as early as 6,000 years ago . Lunar calendars were among the first to appear , either 12 or 13 lunar months ( either 354 or 384 days ) . Without intercalation to add days or months to some years , seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months . Lunisolar calendars have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year ( now known to be about 365.24 days ) and a year of just twelve lunar months . The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures , at least partly due to this relationship of months to years . Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica , particularly in ancient Mayan civilization . These calendars were religiously and astronomically based , with 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month .
Philadelphia is also a major hub for Greyhound Lines , which operates 24-hour service to points east of the Mississippi River . Most of Greyhound 's services in Philadelphia operate to/from the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal , located at 1001 Filbert Street in Center City Philadelphia . In 2006 , the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal was the second busiest Greyhound terminal in the United States , after the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York . Besides Greyhound , six other bus operators provide service to the Center City Greyhound terminal : Bieber Tourways , Capitol Trailways , Martz Trailways , Peter Pan Bus Lines , Susquehanna Trailways , and the bus division for New Jersey Transit . Other services include Megabus and Bolt Bus .
A 2014 profile by the National Health Service showed Plymouth had higher than average levels of poverty and deprivation ( 26.2 % of population among the poorest 20.4 % nationally ) . Life expectancy , at 78.3 years for men and 82.1 for women , was the lowest of any region in the South West of England .
Ferdinand refused and went to Valencia instead of Madrid . Here , on 17 April , General Elio invited the King to reclaim his absolute rights and put his troops at the King 's disposition . The king abolished the Constitution of 1812 . He followed this act by dissolving the two chambers of the Spanish Parliament on 10 May . Thus began six years ( 1814–1820 ) of absolutist rule , but the constitution was reinstated during the Trienio Liberal , a period of three years of liberal government in Spain from 1820–1823 .
In partnership with Gardiner Greene Hubbard , Bell helped establish the publication Science during the early 1880s . In 1898 , Bell was elected as the second president of the National Geographic Society , serving until 1903 , and was primarily responsible for the extensive use of illustrations , including photography , in the magazine . he also became a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution ( 1898–1922 ) . The French government conferred on him the decoration of the Légion d'honneur ( Legion of Honor ) ; the Royal Society of Arts in London awarded him the Albert Medal in 1902 ; the University of Würzburg , Bavaria , granted him a PhD , and he was awarded the Franklin Institute 's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1912 . He was one of the founders of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1884 , and served as its president from 1891–92 . Bell was later awarded the AIEE 's Edison Medal in 1914 " For meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone " .
Another approach to hardware support for database management was ICL 's CAFS accelerator , a hardware disk controller with programmable search capabilities . In the long term , these efforts were generally unsuccessful because specialized database machines could not keep pace with the rapid development and progress of general-purpose computers . Thus most database systems nowadays are software systems running on general-purpose hardware , using general-purpose computer data storage . However this idea is still pursued for certain applications by some companies like Netezza and Oracle ( Exadata ) .
When a USB device is first connected to a USB host , the USB device enumeration process is started . The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device . The data rate of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling . After reset , the USB device 's information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address . If the device is supported by the host , the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state . If the USB host is restarted , the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices .
Bacteria display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes , called morphologies . Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0 micrometres in length . However , a few species are visible to the unaided eye — for example , Thiomargarita namibiensis is up to half a millimetre long and Epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches 0.7 mm . Among the smallest bacteria are members of the genus Mycoplasma , which measure only 0.3 micrometres , as small as the largest viruses . Some bacteria may be even smaller , but these ultramicrobacteria are not well-studied .
The Premier League has the highest revenue of any football league in the world , with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10 . In 2013–14 , due to improved television revenues and cost controls , the Premier League had net profits in excess of £78 million , exceeding all other football leagues . In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen 's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom 's broadcasting industry .
Gautama first went to study with famous religious teachers of the day , and mastered the meditative attainments they taught . But he found that they did not provide a permanent end to suffering , so he continued his quest . He next attempted an extreme asceticism , which was a religious pursuit common among the śramaṇas , a religious culture distinct from the Vedic one . Gautama underwent prolonged fasting , breath-holding , and exposure to pain . He almost starved himself to death in the process . He realized that he had taken this kind of practice to its limit , and had not put an end to suffering . So in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach . He devoted himself to anapanasati meditation , through which he discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way ( Skt . madhyamā-pratipad ) : a path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification .

Miami 's heavy-rail rapid transit system , Metrorail , is an elevated system comprising two lines and 23 stations on a 24.4-mile ( 39.3 km ) -long line . Metrorail connects the urban western suburbs of Hialeah , Medley , and inner-city Miami with suburban The Roads , Coconut Grove , Coral Gables , South Miami and urban Kendall via the central business districts of Miami International Airport , the Civic Center , and Downtown . A free , elevated people mover , Metromover , operates 21 stations on three different lines in greater Downtown Miami , with a station at roughly every two blocks of Downtown and Brickell . Several expansion projects are being funded by a transit development sales tax surcharge throughout Miami-Dade County .
Madaris were largely centred on the study of fiqh ( Islamic jurisprudence ) . The ijāzat al-tadrīs wa-al-iftāʼ ( " licence to teach and issue legal opinions " ) in the medieval Islamic legal education system had its origins in the 9th century after the formation of the madhāhib ( schools of jurisprudence ) . George Makdisi considers the ijāzah to be the origin of the European doctorate . However , in an earlier article , he considered the ijāzah to be of " fundamental difference " to the medieval doctorate , since the former was awarded by an individual teacher-scholar not obliged to follow any formal criteria , whereas the latter was conferred on the student by the collective authority of the faculty . To obtain an ijāzah , a student " had to study in a guild school of law , usually four years for the basic undergraduate course " and ten or more years for a post-graduate course . The " doctorate was obtained after an oral examination to determine the originality of the candidate 's theses " , and to test the student 's " ability to defend them against all objections , in disputations set up for the purpose . " These were scholarly exercises practised throughout the student 's " career as a graduate student of law . " After students completed their post-graduate education , they were awarded ijazas giving them the status of faqīh 'scholar of jurisprudence ' , muftī 'scholar competent in issuing fatwās ' , and mudarris 'teacher ' .
The Bell family home was in Cambridge , Massachusetts , until 1880 when Bell 's father-in-law bought a house in Washington , D.C. , and later in 1882 bought a home in the same city for Bell 's family , so that they could be with him while he attended to the numerous court cases involving patent disputes .
A monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early Ming dynasty is the Yangshan Quarry ( located some 15–20 km ( 9–12 mi ) east of the walled city and Ming Xiaoling mausoleum ) , where a gigantic stele , cut on the orders of the Yongle Emperor , lies abandoned , just as it was left 600 years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it .
When one Republican presidential candidate for the 2016 election ridiculed the liberalism of " New York values " in January 2016 , Donald Trump , leading in the polls , vigorously defended his city . The National Review , a conservative magazine published in the city since its founding by William F. Buckley , Jr. in 1955 , commented , " By hearkening back to New York 's heart after 9/11 , for a moment Trump transcended politics . How easily we forget , but for weeks after the terror attacks , New York was America . "
Śuddhodana was determined to see his son become a king , so he prevented him from leaving the palace grounds . But at age 29 , despite his father 's efforts , Gautama ventured beyond the palace several times . In a series of encounters—known in Buddhist literature as the four sights—he learned of the suffering of ordinary people , encountering an old man , a sick man , a corpse and , finally , an ascetic holy man , apparently content and at peace with the world . These experiences prompted Gautama to abandon royal life and take up a spiritual quest .
In the 1920s and 1930s , air power theorists Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell espoused the idea that air forces could win wars by themselves , without a need for land and sea fighting . It was thought there was no defence against air attack , particularly at night . Enemy industry , their seats of government , factories and communications could be destroyed , effectively taking away their means to resist . It was also thought the bombing of residential centres would cause a collapse of civilian will , which might have led to the collapse of production and civil life . Democracies , where the populace was allowed to show overt disapproval of the ruling government , were thought particularly vulnerable . This thinking was prevalent in both the RAF and what was then known as the United States Army Air Corps ( USAAC ) between the two world wars . RAF Bomber Command 's policy in particular would attempt to achieve victory through the destruction of civilian will , communications and industry .
Bernanke explained that between 1996 and 2004 , the U.S. current account deficit increased by $ 650 billion , from 1.5 % to 5.8 % of GDP . Financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad , much of it from countries running trade surpluses . These were mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations . The balance of payments identity requires that a country ( such as the U.S. ) running a current account deficit also have a capital account ( investment ) surplus of the same amount . Hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds ( capital ) flowed into the U.S. to finance its imports .
Nasser had few personal vices other than chain smoking . He maintained 18-hour workdays and rarely took time off for vacations . The combination of smoking and working long hours contributed to his poor health . He was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 1960s and by the time of his death in 1970 , he also had arteriosclerosis , heart disease , and high blood pressure . He suffered two major heart attacks ( in 1966 and 1969 ) , and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode . State media reported that Nasser 's absence from the public view at that time was a result of influenza .
In August 2008 , West revealed plans to open 10 Fatburger restaurants in the Chicago area ; the first was set to open in September 2008 in Orland Park . The second followed in January 2009 , while a third location is yet to be revealed , although the process is being finalized . His company , KW Foods LLC , bought the rights to the chain in Chicago . Ultimately , in 2009 , only two locations actually opened . In February 2011 , West shut down the Fatburger located in Orland Park . Later that year , the remaining Beverly location also was shuttered .
Berlin starts National Cyber Defense Initiative : On June 16 , 2011 , the German Minister for Home Affairs , officially opened the new German NCAZ ( National Center for Cyber Defense ) Nationales Cyber-Abwehrzentrum located in Bonn . The NCAZ closely cooperates with BSI ( Federal Office for Information Security ) Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik , BKA ( Federal Police Organisation ) Bundeskriminalamt ( Deutschland ) , BND ( Federal Intelligence Service ) Bundesnachrichtendienst , MAD ( Military Intelligence Service ) Amt für den Militärischen Abschirmdienst and other national organisations in Germany taking care of national security aspects . According to the Minister the primary task of the new organisation founded on February 23 , 2011 , is to detect and prevent attacks against the national infrastructure and mentioned incidents like Stuxnet .
During the years immediately following the novel 's publication , Harper Lee enjoyed the attention its popularity garnered her , granting interviews , visiting schools , and attending events honoring the book . In 1961 , when To Kill a Mockingbird was in its 41st week on the bestseller list , it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize , stunning Lee . It also won the Brotherhood Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews in the same year , and the Paperback of the Year award from Bestsellers magazine in 1962 . Starting in 1964 , Lee began to turn down interviews , complaining that the questions were monotonous , and grew concerned that attention she received bordered on the kind of publicity celebrities sought . Since the , she declined talking with reporters about the book . She also steadfastly refused to provide an introduction , writing in 1995 : " Introductions inhibit pleasure , they kill the joy of anticipation , they frustrate curiosity . The only good thing about Introductions is that in some cases they delay the dose to come . Mockingbird still says what it has to say ; it has managed to survive the years without preamble . "
Players may only be transferred during transfer windows that are set by the Football Association . The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January . Player registrations can not be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA , usually on an emergency basis . As of the 2010–11 season , the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21 , with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances . This was to enable the 'home grown ' rule to be enacted , whereby the League would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to be made up of 'home-grown players ' .
More recent Lancashire-born composers include Hugh Wood ( 1932- Parbold ) , Sir Peter Maxwell Davies ( 1934- , Salford ) , Sir Harrison Birtwistle ( 1934- , Accrington ) , Gordon Crosse ( 1937- , Bury ) , John McCabe ( 1939-2015 , Huyton ) , Roger Smalley ( 1943-2015 , Swinton ) , Nigel Osborne ( 1948- , Manchester ) , Steve Martland ( 1954-2013 , Liverpool ) , Simon Holt ( 1958- , Bolton ) and Philip Cashian ( 1963- , Manchester ) . The Royal Manchester College of Music was founded in 1893 to provide a northern counterpart to the London musical colleges . It merged with the Northern College of Music ( formed in 1920 ) to form the Royal Northern College of Music in 1972 .

Blue Ivy 's cries are included at the end of the song , and she was officially credited as " B.I.C . " on it . At two days old , she became the youngest person ever to appear on a Billboard chart when " Glory " debuted on the Hot R & B/Hip-Hop Songs chart .
Whitehead did not begin his career as a philosopher . In fact , he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education . Early in his life he showed great interest in and respect for philosophy and metaphysics , but it is evident that he considered himself a rank amateur . In one letter to his friend and former student Bertrand Russell , after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive , he wrote : " This further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic , onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter . " Ironically , in later life Whitehead would become one of the 20th century 's foremost metaphysicians .
The Legislature is composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives . The House , led by a speaker , has 73 members apportioned among the 15 counties on the basis of the national census , with each county receiving a minimum of two members . Each House member represents an electoral district within a county as drawn by the National Elections Commission and is elected by a plurality of the popular vote of their district into a six-year term . The Senate is made up of two senators from each county for a total of 30 senators . Senators serve nine-year terms and are elected at-large by a plurality of the popular vote . The vice president serves as the President of the Senate , with a President pro tempore serving in their absence .
On the other hand , classical ( analog ) television transmissions are usually horizontally polarized , because in urban areas buildings can reflect the electromagnetic waves and create ghost images due to multipath propagation . Using horizontal polarization , ghosting is reduced because the amount of reflection of electromagnetic waves in the p polarization ( horizontal polarization off the side of a building ) is generally less than s ( vertical , in this case ) polarization . Vertically polarized analog television has nevertheless been used in some rural areas . In digital terrestrial television such reflections are less problematic , due to robustness of binary transmissions and error correction .
Victoria later described her childhood as " rather melancholy " . Her mother was extremely protective , and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called " Kensington System " , an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller , Sir John Conroy , who was rumoured to be the Duchess 's lover . The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable ( including most of her father 's family ) , and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them . The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William 's bastard children , and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety . Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night , studied with private tutors to a regular timetable , and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel , Dash . Her lessons included French , German , Italian , and Latin , but she spoke only English at home .
The structures of most federal governments incorporate mechanisms to protect the rights of component states . One method , known as 'intrastate federalism ' , is to directly represent the governments of component states in federal political institutions . Where a federation has a bicameral legislature the upper house is often used to represent the component states while the lower house represents the people of the nation as a whole . A federal upper house may be based on a special scheme of apportionment , as is the case in the senates of the United States and Australia , where each state is represented by an equal number of senators irrespective of the size of its population .
Since the end of the World Wars , the term " great power " has been joined by a number of other power classifications . Foremost among these is the concept of the superpower , used to describe those nations with overwhelming power and influence in the rest of the world . It was first coined in 1944 by William T.R . Fox and according to him , there were three superpowers : the British Empire , the United States , and the Soviet Union . But by the mid-1950s the British Empire lost its superpower status , leaving the United States and the Soviet Union as the world 's superpowers . [ nb 2 ] The term middle power has emerged for those nations which exercise a degree of global influence , but are insufficient to be decisive on international affairs . Regional powers are those whose influence is generally confined to their region of the world .
Only one 5.1 surround sound option exists on a given LaserDisc ( either Dolby Digital or DTS ) , so if surround sound is desired , the disc must be matched to the capabilities of the playback equipment ( LD Player and Receiver/Decoder ) by the purchaser . A fully capable LaserDisc playback system includes a newer LaserDisc player that is capable of playing digital tracks , has a digital optical output for digital PCM and DTS audio , is aware of AC-3 audio tracks , and has an AC-3 coaxial output ; an external or internal AC-3 RF demodulator and AC-3 decoder ; and a DTS decoder . Many 1990s A/V receivers combine the AC-3 decoder and DTS decoder logic , but an integrated AC-3 demodulator is rare both in LaserDisc players and in later A/V receivers .
Chapultepec Park houses the Chapultepec Castle , now a museum on a hill that overlooks the park and its numerous museums , monuments and the national zoo and the National Museum of Anthropology ( which houses the Aztec Calendar Stone ) . Another piece of architecture is the Fine Arts Palace , a white marble theatre/museum whose weight is such that it has gradually been sinking into the soft ground below . Its construction began during the presidency of Porfirio Díaz and ended in 1934 , after being interrupted by the Mexican Revolution in the 1920s . The Plaza of the Three Cultures in the Tlatelolco neighbourhood , and the shrine and Basilicas of Our Lady of Guadalupe are also important sites . There is a double-decker bus , known as the " Turibus " , that circles most of these sites , and has timed audio describing the sites in multiple languages as they are passed .
Most languages today , even in countries that have no direct link to Greco-Roman culture , use some variant of the name " Neptune " for the planet . However , in Chinese , Japanese , and Korean , the planet 's name was translated as " sea king star " ( 海王星 ) , because Neptune was the god of the sea . In Mongolian , Neptune is called Dalain Van ( Далайн ван ) , reflecting its namesake god 's role as the ruler of the sea . In modern Greek the planet is called Poseidon ( Ποσειδώνας , Poseidonas ) , the Greek counterpart of Neptune . In Hebrew , " Rahab " ( רהב ) , from a Biblical sea monster mentioned in the Book of Psalms , was selected in a vote managed by the Academy of the Hebrew Language in 2009 as the official name for the planet , even though the existing Latin term " Neptun " ( נפטון ) is commonly used . In Māori , the planet is called Tangaroa , named after the Māori god of the sea . In Nahuatl , the planet is called Tlāloccītlalli , named after the rain god Tlāloc .
Remodelling of the structure began in 1762 . After his accession to the throne in 1820 , King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small , comfortable home . While the work was in progress , in 1826 , the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash . Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House , and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution . The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV . The cost of the renovations grew dramatically , and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash 's designs resulted in his removal as architect . On the death of George IV in 1830 , his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work . At one stage , William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament , after the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834 .
There have been instances where a country 's government bans a movie , resulting in the spread of copied videos and DVDs . Romanian-born documentary maker Ilinca Calugareanu wrote a New York Times article telling the story of Irina Margareta Nistor , a narrator for state TV under Nicolae Ceauşescu 's regime . A visitor from the west gave her bootlegged copies of American movies , which she dubbed for secret viewings through Romania . According to the article , she dubbed more than 3,000 movies and became the country 's second-most famous voice after Ceauşescu , even though no one knew her name until many years later .
Public expenditure rose from £10 million in 2001-02 to £12 million in 2005-06 to £28m in 2012-13 . The contribution of UK budgetary aid to total SHG government expenditure rose from £4.6 million in to £6.4 million to £12.1 million over the same period . Wages and salaries represent about 38 % of recurrent expenditure .
On April 18 , 1985 , a few months after taking his Senate seat , Kerry and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa traveled to Nicaragua and met the country 's president , Daniel Ortega . Though Ortega had won internationally certified elections , the trip was criticized because Ortega and his leftist Sandinista government had strong ties to Cuba and the USSR and were accused of human rights abuses . The Sandinista government was opposed by the right-wing CIA-backed rebels known as the Contras . While in Nicaragua , Kerry and Harkin talked to people on both sides of the conflict . Through the senators , Ortega offered a cease-fire agreement in exchange for the U.S. dropping support of the Contras . The offer was denounced by the Reagan administration as a " propaganda initiative " designed to influence a House vote on a $ 14 million Contra aid package , but Kerry said " I am willing ... .. to take the risk in the effort to put to test the good faith of the Sandinistas . " The House voted down the Contra aid , but Ortega flew to Moscow to accept a $ 200 million loan the next day , which in part prompted the House to pass a larger $ 27 million aid package six weeks later .
Portuguese universities have existed since 1290 . The oldest Portuguese university was first established in Lisbon before moving to Coimbra . Historically , within the scope of the Portuguese Empire , the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering school of the Americas ( the Real Academia de Artilharia , Fortificação e Desenho of Rio de Janeiro ) in 1792 , as well as the oldest medical college in Asia ( the Escola Médico-Cirúrgica of Goa ) in 1842 . The largest university in Portugal is the University of Lisbon .

The county has several museums ; those at Bath include the American Museum in Britain , the Museum of Bath Architecture , the Herschel Museum of Astronomy , the Jane Austen Centre , and the Roman Baths . Other visitor attractions which reflect the cultural heritage of the county include : Claverton Pumping Station , Dunster Working Watermill , the Fleet Air Arm Museum at Yeovilton , Nunney Castle , The Helicopter Museum in Weston-super-Mare , King John 's Hunting Lodge in Axbridge , Blake Museum Bridgwater , Radstock Museum , Museum of Somerset in Taunton , the Somerset Rural Life Museum in Glastonbury , and Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum .
In contrast to the entirely digital DVD , LaserDiscs use only analog video . As the LaserDisc format is not digitally encoded and does not make use of compression techniques , it is immune to video macroblocking ( most visible as blockiness during high motion sequences ) or contrast banding ( subtle visible lines in gradient areas , such as out-of-focus backgrounds , skies , or light casts from spotlights ) that can be caused by the MPEG-2 encoding process as video is prepared for DVD . Early DVD releases held the potential to surpass their LaserDisc counterparts , but often managed only to match them for image quality , and in some cases , the LaserDisc version was preferred . However , proprietary human-assisted encoders manually operated by specialists can vastly reduce the incidence of artifacts , depending on playing time and image complexity . By the end of LaserDisc 's run , DVDs were living up to their potential as a superior format .
There are two methods of corruption of the judiciary : the state ( through budget planning and various privileges ) , and the private . Budget of the judiciary in many transitional and developing countries is almost completely controlled by the executive . The latter undermines the separation of powers , as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary . The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject of the constitutional economics . Judicial corruption can be difficult to completely eradicate , even in developed countries .
The largest private university in Uruguay , is also located in Montevideo . ORT Uruguay was first established as a non-profit organization in 1942 , and was officially certified as a private university in September 1996 , becoming the second private educational institution in the country to achieve that status . [ citation needed ] It is a member of World ORT , an international educational network founded in 1880 by the Jewish community in Saint Petersburg , Russia . The university has about 8,000 students , distributed among 5 faculties and institutes , mainly geared towards the sciences and technology/engineering . Its current rector as of 2010 [ update ] is Dr. Jorge A. Grünberg .
German air attacks on the British Isles increased in 1915 and the AA efforts were deemed somewhat ineffective , so a Royal Navy gunnery expert , Admiral Sir Percy Scott , was appointed to make improvements , particularly an integrated AA defence for London . The air defences were expanded with more RNVR AA guns , 75 mm and 3-inch , the pom-poms being ineffective . The naval 3-inch was also adopted by the army , the QF 3 inch 20 cwt ( 76 mm ) , a new field mounting was introduced in 1916 . Since most attacks were at night , searchlights were soon used , and acoustic methods of detection and locating were developed . By December 1916 there were 183 AA Sections defending Britain ( most with the 3-inch ) , 74 with the BEF in France and 10 in the Middle East .
In 2008 , Houston received top ranking on Kiplinger 's Personal Finance Best Cities of 2008 list , which ranks cities on their local economy , employment opportunities , reasonable living costs , and quality of life . The city ranked fourth for highest increase in the local technological innovation over the preceding 15 years , according to Forbes magazine . In the same year , the city ranked second on the annual Fortune 500 list of company headquarters , first for Forbes magazine 's Best Cities for College Graduates , and first on their list of Best Cities to Buy a Home . In 2010 , the city was rated the best city for shopping , according to Forbes .
In 1977 , Gaddafi dissolved the Republic and created a new socialist state , the Jamahiriya ( " state of the masses " ) . Officially adopting a symbolic role in governance , he retained power as military commander-in-chief and head of the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing opponents . Overseeing unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad , Gaddafi 's support for foreign militants and alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing led to Libya 's label of " international pariah " . A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States and United Kingdom , resulting in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and United Nations-imposed economic sanctions . Rejecting his earlier ideological commitments , from 1999 Gaddafi encouraged economic privatization and sought rapprochement with Western nations , also embracing Pan-Africanism and helping to establish the African Union . Amid the Arab Spring , in 2011 an anti-Gaddafist uprising led by the National Transitional Council ( NTC ) broke out , resulting in the Libyan Civil War . NATO intervened militarily on the side of the NTC , bringing about the government 's downfall . Retreating to Sirte , Gaddafi was captured and killed by NTC militants .
The low mechanical complexity of hydraulic elevators in comparison to traction elevators makes them ideal for low rise , low traffic installations . They are less energy efficient as the pump works against gravity to push the car and its passengers upwards ; this energy is lost when the car descends on its own weight . The high current draw of the pump when starting up also places higher demands on a building’s electrical system . There are also environmental concerns should the lifting cylinder leak fluid into the ground .
Since 1066 , when Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror were crowned , the coronations of English and British monarchs have been held there . There have been at least 16 royal weddings at the abbey since 1100 . Two were of reigning monarchs ( Henry I and Richard II ) , although , before 1919 , there had been none for some 500 years .
After the downfall of the prior Gupta Empire in the middle of the 6th century , North India reverted to small republics and small monarchical states ruled by Gupta rulers . Harsha was a convert to Buddhism . He united the small republics from Punjab to central India , and their representatives crowned Harsha king at an assembly in April 606 giving him the title of Maharaja when he was merely 16 years old . Harsha belonged to Kanojia . He brought all of northern India under his control . The peace and prosperity that prevailed made his court a center of cosmopolitanism , attracting scholars , artists and religious visitors from far and wide . The Chinese traveler Xuan Zang visited the court of Harsha and wrote a very favorable account of him , praising his justice and generosity .
The effective area or effective aperture of a receiving antenna expresses the portion of the power of a passing electromagnetic wave which it delivers to its terminals , expressed in terms of an equivalent area . For instance , if a radio wave passing a given location has a flux of 1 pW / m2 ( 10−12 watts per square meter ) and an antenna has an effective area of 12 m2 , then the antenna would deliver 12 pW of RF power to the receiver ( 30 microvolts rms at 75 ohms ) . Since the receiving antenna is not equally sensitive to signals received from all directions , the effective area is a function of the direction to the source .
The Lacey Act of 1900 was the first federal law that regulated commercial animal markets . It prohibited interstate commerce of animals killed in violation of state game laws , and covered all fish and wildlife and their parts or products , as well as plants . Other legislation followed , including the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 , a 1937 treaty prohibiting the hunting of right and gray whales , and the Bald Eagle Protection Act of 1940 . These later laws had a low cost to society–the species were relatively rare–and little opposition was raised .
South Tucson is actually the name of an independent , incorporated town of 1 sq mi ( 2.6 km2 ) , completely surrounded by the city of Tucson , sitting just south of downtown . South Tucson has a colorful , dynamic history . It was first incorporated in 1936 , and later reincorporated in 1940 . The population consists of about 83 % Mexican-American and 10 % Native American residents . South Tucson is widely known for its many Mexican restaurants and the architectural styles which include bright outdoor murals , many of which have been painted over due to city policy .
Some scholars [ note 44 ] use other schemes . Buddhists themselves have a variety of other schemes . Hinayana ( literally " lesser vehicle " ) is used by Mahayana followers to name the family of early philosophical schools and traditions from which contemporary Theravada emerged , but as this term is rooted in the Mahayana viewpoint and can be considered derogatory , a variety of other terms are increasingly used instead , including Śrāvakayāna , Nikaya Buddhism , early Buddhist schools , sectarian Buddhism , conservative Buddhism , mainstream Buddhism and non-Mahayana Buddhism .
Although the advance in the Arakan had been halted to release troops and aircraft for the Battle of Imphal , the Americans and Chinese had continued to advance in northern Burma , aided by the Chindits operating against the Japanese lines of communication . In the middle of 1944 the Chinese Expeditionary Force invaded northern Burma from Yunnan province . They captured a fortified position at Mount Song . By the time campaigning ceased during the monsoon rains , the NCAC had secured a vital airfield at Myitkyina ( August 1944 ) , which eased the problems of air resupply from India to China over " The Hump " .
Paper at this point is uncoated . Coated paper has a thin layer of material such as calcium carbonate or china clay applied to one or both sides in order to create a surface more suitable for high-resolution halftone screens . ( Uncoated papers are rarely suitable for screens above 150 lpi . ) Coated or uncoated papers may have their surfaces polished by calendering . Coated papers are divided into matte , semi-matte or silk , and gloss . Gloss papers give the highest optical density in the printed image .
The company continued to carefully review submitted titles , giving them scores using a 40-point scale and allocating Nintendo 's marketing resources accordingly . Each region performed separate evaluations . Nintendo of America also maintained a policy that , among other things , limited the amount of violence in the games on its systems . One game , Mortal Kombat , would challenge this policy . A surprise hit in arcades in 1992 , Mortal Kombat features splashes of blood and finishing moves that often depict one character dismembering the other . Because the Genesis version retained the gore while the SNES version did not , it outsold the SNES version by a ratio of three or four-to-one .
A belt of massive fortifications was established around the city , most of which still stands today , renamed after French generals and generally classified as Monuments historiques ; most notably Fort Roon ( now Fort Desaix ) and Fort Podbielski ( now Fort Ducrot ) in Mundolsheim , Fort von Moltke ( now Fort Rapp ) in Reichstett , Fort Bismarck ( now Fort Kléber ) in Wolfisheim , Fort Kronprinz ( now Fort Foch ) in Niederhausbergen , Fort Kronprinz von Sachsen ( now Fort Joffre ) in Holtzheim and Fort Großherzog von Baden ( now Fort Frère ) in Oberhausbergen .
John Keate , Head Master from 1809 to 1834 , took over at a time when discipline was poor . Anthony Chenevix-Trench , Head Master from 1964 to 1970 , abolished the birch and replaced it with caning , also applied to the bare posterior , which he administered privately in his office . Chenevix-Trench also abolished corporal punishment administered by senior boys . Previously , House Captains were permitted to cane miscreants over the seat of the trousers . This was a routine occurrence , carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of a table . Less common but more severe were the canings administered by Pop ( see Eton Society below ) in the form of a " Pop-Tanning " , in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the President of Pop in the presence of all Pop members ( or , in earlier times , each member of Pop took it in turns to inflict a stroke ) . The culprit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers , as the caning would cut the cloth to shreds . This was the most severe form of physical punishment at Eton .
In Tunisia , Algeria , and Morocco , the Darijas ( spoken North African languages ) are sometimes considered more different from other Arabic dialects . Officially , North African countries prefer to give preference to the Literary Arabic and conduct much of their political and religious life in it ( adherence to Islam ) , and refrain from declaring each country 's specific variety to be a separate language , because Literary Arabic is the liturgical language of Islam and the language of the Islamic sacred book , the Qur'an . Although , especially since the 1960s , the Darijas are occupying an increasing use and influence in the cultural life of these countries . Examples of cultural elements where Darijas ' use became dominant include : theatre , film , music , television , advertisement , social media , folk-tale books and companies ' names .
Many other inventions marked Bell 's later life , including groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications , hydrofoils and aeronautics . Although Bell was not one of the 33 founders of the National Geographic Society , he had a strong influence on the magazine while serving as the second president from January 7 , 1898 until 1903 .
In general , translators have sought to preserve the context itself by reproducing the original order of sememes , and hence word order — when necessary , reinterpreting the actual grammatical structure , for example , by shifting from active to passive voice , or vice versa . The grammatical differences between " fixed-word-order " languages ( e.g . English , French , German ) and " free-word-order " languages ( e.g. , Greek , Latin , Polish , Russian ) have been no impediment in this regard . The particular syntax ( sentence-structure ) characteristics of a text 's source language are adjusted to the syntactic requirements of the target language .
The state of California was admitted to the United States in 1850 . That same year San Diego was designated the seat of the newly established San Diego County and was incorporated as a city . Joshua H. Bean , the last alcalde of San Diego , was elected the first mayor . Two years later the city was bankrupt ; the California legislature revoked the city 's charter and placed it under control of a board of trustees , where it remained until 1889 . A city charter was re-established in 1889 and today 's city charter was adopted in 1931 .
Tourism has been a key factor in economic development for many Southeast Asian countries , especially Cambodia . According to UNESCO , " tourism , if correctly conceived , can be a tremendous development tool and an effective means of preserving the cultural diversity of our planet . " Since the early 1990s , " even the non-ASEAN nations such as Cambodia , Laos , Vietnam and Burma , where the income derived from tourism is low , are attempting to expand their own tourism industries . " In 1995 , Singapore was the regional leader in tourism receipts relative to GDP at over 8 % . By 1998 , those receipts had dropped to less than 6 % of GDP while Thailand and Lao PDR increased receipts to over 7 % . Since 2000 , Cambodia has surpassed all other ASEAN countries and generated almost 15 % of its GDP from tourism in 2006 .
Emilio Marcos Palma was the first person born south of the 60th parallel south ( the continental limit according to the Antarctic Treaty ) , as well as the first one born on the Antarctic mainland , in 1978 at Base Esperanza , on the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula ; his parents were sent there along with seven other families by the Argentine government to determine if the continent was suitable for family life . In 1984 , Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Frei Montalva Station , becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica . Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station . As of 2009 , eleven children were born in Antarctica ( south of the 60th parallel south ) : eight at the Argentine Esperanza Base and three at the Chilean Frei Montalva Station .
Hard rock entered the 1990s as one of the dominant forms of commercial music . The multi-platinum releases of AC/DC 's The Razors Edge ( 1990 ) , Guns N ' Roses ' Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II ( both in 1991 ) , Ozzy Osbourne 's No More Tears ( 1991 ) , and Van Halen 's For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge ( 1991 ) showcased this popularity . Additionally , The Black Crowes released their debut album , Shake Your Money Maker ( 1990 ) , which contained a bluesy classic rock sound and sold five million copies . In 1992 , Def Leppard followed up 1987 's Hysteria with Adrenalize , which went multi-platinum , spawned four Top 40 singles and held the number one spot on the US album chart for five weeks .
Subsequently , it became one of Britain 's most significant honours to be buried or commemorated in the abbey . The practice of burying national figures in the abbey began under Oliver Cromwell with the burial of Admiral Robert Blake in 1657 . The practice spread to include generals , admirals , politicians , doctors and scientists such as Isaac Newton , buried on 4 April 1727 , and Charles Darwin , buried 26 April 1882 . Another was William Wilberforce who led the movement to abolish slavery in the United Kingdom and the Plantations , buried on 3 August 1833 . Wilberforce was buried in the north transept , close to his friend , the former Prime Minister , William Pitt . [ citation needed ]
Red wine may offer health benefits more so than white because potentially beneficial compounds are present in grape skin , and only red wine is fermented with skins . The amount of fermentation time a wine spends in contact with grape skins is an important determinant of its resveratrol content . Ordinary non-muscadine red wine contains between 0.2 and 5.8 mg/L , depending on the grape variety , because it is fermented with the skins , allowing the wine to absorb the resveratrol . By contrast , a white wine contains lower phenolic contents because it is fermented after removal of skins .
Shōen holders had access to manpower and , as they obtained improved military technology ( such as new training methods , more powerful bows , armor , horses , and superior swords ) and faced worsening local conditions in the ninth century , military service became part of shōen life . Not only the shōen but also civil and religious institutions formed private guard units to protect themselves . Gradually , the provincial upper class was transformed into a new military elite based on the ideals of the bushi ( warrior ) or samurai ( literally , one who serves ) .
While the original Xbox sold poorly in Japan , selling just 2 million units while it was on the market ( between 2002 and 2005 ) , [ citation needed ] the Xbox 360 sold even more poorly , selling only 1.5 million units from 2005 to 2011 . Edge magazine reported in August 2011 that initially lackluster and subsequently falling sales in Japan , where Microsoft had been unable to make serious inroads into the dominance of domestic rivals Sony and Nintendo , had led to retailers scaling down and in some cases discontinuing sales of the Xbox 360 completely .
There are 20 clubs in the Premier League . During the course of a season ( from August to May ) each club plays the others twice ( a double round-robin system ) , once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents , for a total of 38 games . Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw . No points are awarded for a loss . Teams are ranked by total points , then goal difference , and then goals scored . If still equal , teams are deemed to occupy the same position . If there is a tie for the championship , for relegation , or for qualification to other competitions , a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank . The three lowest placed teams are relegated into the Football League Championship , and the top two teams from the Championship , together with the winner of play-offs involving the third to sixth placed Championship clubs , are promoted in their place .
As a result of continued warming , the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert . In Eastern Antarctica , seed ferns or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time . Synapsids , commonly known as " mammal-like reptiles " , were common in Antarctica during the Early Triassic and included forms such as Lystrosaurus . The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the Jurassic period ( 206–146 Ma ) , and islands gradually rose out of the ocean . Ginkgo trees , conifers , bennettites , horsetails , ferns and cycads were plentiful during this period . In West Antarctica , coniferous forests dominated through the entire Cretaceous period ( 146–66 Ma ) , though southern beech became more prominent towards the end of this period . Ammonites were common in the seas around Antarctica , and dinosaurs were also present , though only three Antarctic dinosaur genera ( Cryolophosaurus and Glacialisaurus , from the Hanson Formation , and Antarctopelta ) have been described to date . It was during this era that Gondwana began to break up .
According to Orthodox Judaism , Jewish law today is based on the commandments in the Torah , as viewed through the discussions and debates contained in classical rabbinic literature , especially the Mishnah and the Talmud . Orthodox Judaism thus holds that the halakha represents the " will of God " , either directly , or as closely to directly as possible . The laws are from the word of God in the Torah , using a set of rules also revealed by God to Moses on Mount Sinai , and have been derived with the utmost accuracy and care , and thus the Oral Law is considered to be no less the word of God . If some of the details of Jewish law may have been lost over the millennia , they were reconstructed in accordance with internally consistent rules ; see The 13 rules by which Jewish law was derived .
The Mature Indus civilisation flourished from about 2600 to 1900 BCE , marking the beginning of urban civilisation on the subcontinent . The civilisation included urban centres such as Dholavira , Kalibangan , Ropar , Rakhigarhi , and Lothal in modern-day India , as well as Harappa , Ganeriwala , and Mohenjo-daro in modern-day Pakistan . The civilisation is noted for its cities built of brick , roadside drainage system , and multistoreyed houses and is thought to have had some kind of municipal organization .
The beginning of the Neolithic culture is considered to be in the Levant ( Jericho , modern-day West Bank ) about 10,200 – 8,800 BC . It developed directly from the Epipaleolithic Natufian culture in the region , whose people pioneered the use of wild cereals , which then evolved into true farming . The Natufian period was between 12,000 and 10,200 BC , and the so-called " proto-Neolithic " is now included in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic ( PPNA ) between 10,200 and 8,800 BC . As the Natufians had become dependent on wild cereals in their diet , and a sedentary way of life had begun among them , the climatic changes associated with the Younger Dryas are thought to have forced people to develop farming .
The most commonly given starting point for the Middle Ages is 476 , first used by Bruni . [ A ] For Europe as a whole , 1500 is often considered to be the end of the Middle Ages , but there is no universally agreed upon end date . Depending on the context , events such as Christopher Columbus 's first voyage to the Americas in 1492 , the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453 , or the Protestant Reformation in 1517 are sometimes used . English historians often use the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 to mark the end of the period . For Spain , dates commonly used are the death of King Ferdinand II in 1516 , the death of Queen Isabella I of Castile in 1504 , or the conquest of Granada in 1492 . Historians from Romance-speaking countries tend to divide the Middle Ages into two parts : an earlier " High " and later " Low " period . English-speaking historians , following their German counterparts , generally subdivide the Middle Ages into three intervals : " Early " , " High " , and " Late " . In the 19th century , the entire Middle Ages were often referred to as the " Dark Ages " , [ B ] but with the adoption of these subdivisions , use of this term was restricted to the Early Middle Ages , at least among historians .
In early 2009 , Spielberg shot the first film in a planned trilogy of motion capture films based on The Adventures of Tintin , written by Belgian artist Hergé , with Peter Jackson . The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn , was not released until October 2011 , due to the complexity of the computer animation involved . The world premiere took place on October 22 , 2011 in Brussels , Belgium . The film was released in North American theaters on December 21 , 2011 , in Digital 3D and IMAX . It received generally positive reviews from critics , and grossed over $ 373 million worldwide . The Adventures of Tintin won the award for Best Animated Feature Film at the Golden Globe Awards that year . It is the first non-Pixar film to win the award since the category was first introduced . Jackson has been announced to direct the second film .
In the same war , the Prussian Edward Schnell served the Aizu domain as a military instructor and procurer of weapons . He was granted the Japanese name Hiramatsu Buhei ( 平松武兵衛 ) , which inverted the characters of the daimyo 's name Matsudaira . Hiramatsu ( Schnell ) was given the right to wear swords , as well as a residence in the castle town of Wakamatsu , a Japanese wife , and retainers . In many contemporary references , he is portrayed wearing a Japanese kimono , overcoat , and swords , with Western riding trousers and boots .
A gastropub concentrates on quality food . The name is a portmanteau of pub and gastronomy and was coined in 1991 when David Eyre and Mike Belben took over The Eagle pub in Clerkenwell , London . The concept of a restaurant in a pub reinvigorated both pub culture and British dining , though has occasionally attracted criticism for potentially removing the character of traditional pubs .
Back in Warsaw that year , Chopin heard Niccolò Paganini play the violin , and composed a set of variations , Souvenir de Paganini . It may have been this experience which encouraged him to commence writing his first Études , ( 1829–32 ) , exploring the capacities of his own instrument . On 11 August , three weeks after completing his studies at the Warsaw Conservatory , he made his debut in Vienna . He gave two piano concerts and received many favourable reviews—in addition to some commenting ( in Chopin 's own words ) that he was " too delicate for those accustomed to the piano-bashing of local artists " . In one of these concerts , he premiered his Variations on Là ci darem la mano , Op . 2 ( variations on an aria from Mozart 's opera Don Giovanni ) for piano and orchestra . He returned to Warsaw in September 1829 , where he premiered his Piano Concerto No . 2 in F minor , Op . 21 on 17 March 1830 .
In 1940 , non-Hispanic whites constituted 86.8 % of the city 's population . The population peaked at more than two million residents in 1950 , then began to decline with the restructuring of industry , which led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs . In addition , suburbanization had been drawing off many of the wealthier residents to outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing . Revitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century , with much of the development in the Center City and University City areas of the city . After many of the old manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down , the city started attracting service businesses and began to more aggressively market itself as a tourist destination . Glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City . Historic areas such as Independence National Historical Park located in Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s . They are now among the most desirable living areas of Center City . This has slowed the city 's 40-year population decline after it lost nearly one-quarter of its population .
Spielberg first met actress Amy Irving in 1976 at the suggestion of director Brian De Palma , who knew he was looking for an actress to play in Close Encounters . After meeting her , Spielberg told his co-producer Julia Phillips , " I met a real heartbreaker last night . " :293 Although she was too young for the role , she and Spielberg began dating and she eventually moved in to what she described as his " bachelor funky " house . :294 They lived together for four years , but the stresses of their professional careers took a toll on their relationship . Irving wanted to be certain that whatever success she attained as an actress would be her own : " I do n't want to be known as Steven 's girlfriend , " she said , and chose not to be in any of his films during those years . :295
Chain department stores grew rapidly after 1920 , and provided competition for the downtown upscale department stores , as well as local department stores in small cities . J. C. Penney had four stores in 1908 , 312 in 1920 , and 1452 in 1930 . Sears , Roebuck & Company , a giant mail-order house , opened its first eight retail stores in 1925 , and operated 338 by 1930 , and 595 by 1940 . The chains reached a middle-class audience , that was more interested in value than in upscale fashions . Sears was a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men as well as women , especially with lines of hardware and building materials . It deemphasized the latest fashions in favor of practicality and durability , and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk . Its stores were oriented to motorists – set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience ; had ample , free , off-street parking ; and communicated a clear corporate identity . In the 1930s , the company designed fully air-conditioned , " windowless " stores whose layout was driven wholly by merchandising concerns .
In 2014 , the league announced the granting of a new franchise to former Mötley Crüe frontman Vince Neil , previously part-owner of the Jacksonville Sharks . That franchise , the Las Vegas Outlaws , were originally to play in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in 2015 , but instead played their home games at the Thomas & Mack Center , previous home to the Las Vegas Sting and Las Vegas Gladiators . After 20 years as a familiar name to the league , an AFL mainstay , the Iowa Barnstormers , departed the league to join the Indoor Football League . The San Antonio Talons folded on October 13 , 2014 , after the league ( which owned the team ) failed to find a new owner . On November 16 , 2014 , despite a successful season record-wise , the Pittsburgh Power became the second team to cease operations after the 2014 season . This resulted from poor attendance . It was later announced by the league that the Power would go dormant for 2015 and were looking for new ownership .
While Nasser was increasingly criticized by Egyptian intellectuals following the Six-Day War and his death in 1970 , the general public was persistently sympathetic both during and after Nasser 's life . According to political scientist Mahmoud Hamad , writing in 2008 , " nostalgia for Nasser is easily sensed in Egypt and all Arab countries today " . General malaise in Egyptian society , particularly during the Mubarak era , augmented nostalgia for Nasser 's presidency , which increasingly became associated with the ideals of national purpose , hope , social cohesion , and vibrant culture .
In February 1861 , secessionists in Tennessee 's state government—led by Governor Isham Harris—sought voter approval for a convention to sever ties with the United States , but Tennessee voters rejected the referendum by a 54–46 % margin . The strongest opposition to secession came from East Tennessee ( which later tried to form a separate Union-aligned state ) . Following the Confederate attack upon Fort Sumter in April and Lincoln 's call for troops from Tennessee and other states in response , Governor Isham Harris began military mobilization , submitted an ordinance of secession to the General Assembly , and made direct overtures to the Confederate government . The Tennessee legislature ratified an agreement to enter a military league with the Confederate States on May 7 , 1861 . On June 8 , 1861 , with people in Middle Tennessee having significantly changed their position , voters approved a second referendum calling for secession , becoming the last state to do so .
Old English is one of the West Germanic languages , and its closest relatives are Old Frisian and Old Saxon . Like other old Germanic languages , it is very different from Modern English and difficult for Modern English speakers to understand without study . Old English grammar is quite similar to that of modern German : nouns , adjectives , pronouns , and verbs have many inflectional endings and forms , and word order is much freer . The oldest Old English inscriptions were written using a runic system , but from about the 9th century this was replaced by a version of the Latin alphabet .
The earliest extant arguments that the world of experience is grounded in the mental derive from India and Greece . The Hindu idealists in India and the Greek Neoplatonists gave panentheistic arguments for an all-pervading consciousness as the ground or true nature of reality . In contrast , the Yogācāra school , which arose within Mahayana Buddhism in India in the 4th century CE , based its " mind-only " idealism to a greater extent on phenomenological analyses of personal experience . This turn toward the subjective anticipated empiricists such as George Berkeley , who revived idealism in 18th-century Europe by employing skeptical arguments against materialism .
The second-largest business district in terms of employment is La Défense , just west of the city , where many companies installed their offices in the 1990s . In 2010 it was the workplace of 144,600 employees , of whom 38 percent worked in finance and insurance , 16 percent in business support services . Two other important districts , Neuilly-sur-Seine and Levallois-Perret , are extensions of the Paris business district and of La Defense . Another district , including Boulogne-Billancourt , Issy-les-Moulineaux and the southern part of the 15th arrondissement , is a center of activity for the media and information technology .
A mummified man , determined to be 5,000 years old , was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian–Italian border in 1991 . By the 6th century BC , the Celtic La Tène culture was well established . Hannibal famously crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants , and the Romans had settlements in the region . In 1800 Napoleon crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000 . The 18th and 19th centuries saw an influx of naturalists , writers , and artists , in particular the Romantics , followed by the golden age of alpinism as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks . In World War II , Adolf Hitler kept a base of operation in the Bavarian Alps throughout the war .
With financial support from Sanders and Hubbard , Bell hired Thomas Watson as his assistant , [ N 15 ] and the two of them experimented with acoustic telegraphy . On June 2 , 1875 , Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell , at the receiving end of the wire , heard the overtones of the reed ; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech . That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary , not multiple reeds . This led to the " gallows " sound-powered telephone , which could transmit indistinct , voice-like sounds , but not clear speech .
On December 13 , 2013 , Beyoncé unexpectedly released her eponymous fifth studio album on the iTunes Store without any prior announcement or promotion . The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart , giving Beyoncé her fifth consecutive number-one album in the US . This made her the first woman in the chart 's history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one . Beyoncé received critical acclaim and commercial success , selling one million digital copies worldwide in six days ; The New York Times noted the album 's unconventional , unexpected release as significant . Musically an electro-R & B album , it concerns darker themes previously unexplored in her work , such as " bulimia , postnatal depression [ and ] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood " . The single " Drunk in Love " , featuring Jay Z , peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . In April 2014 , after much speculation in the weeks before , Beyoncé and Jay Z officially announced their On the Run Tour . It served as the couple 's first co-headlining stadium tour together . On August 24 , 2014 , she received the Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards . Knowles also took home three competitive awards : Best Video with a Social Message and Best Cinematography for " Pretty Hurts " , as well as best collaboration for " Drunk in Love " . In November , Forbes reported that Beyoncé was the top-earning woman in music for the second year in a row—earning $ 115 million in the year , more than double her earnings in 2013 . Beyoncé was reissued with new material in three forms : as an extended play , a box set , as well as a full platinum edition .
In 1355 in Buda King Casimir III the Great issued the first country-wide privilege for the nobility , in exchange for their agreement that in the lack of Casimir 's male heirs , the throne would pass to his nephew , Louis I of Hungary . He decreed that the nobility would no longer be subject to 'extraordinary ' taxes , or use their own funds for military expeditions abroad . He also promised that during travels of the royal court , the king and the court would pay for all expenses , instead of using facilities of local nobility .
Lack of political unity within Greece resulted in frequent conflict between Greek states . The most devastating intra-Greek war was the Peloponnesian War ( 431–404 BC ) , won by Sparta and marking the demise of the Athenian Empire as the leading power in ancient Greece . Both Athens and Sparta were later overshadowed by Thebes and eventually Macedon , with the latter uniting the Greek world in the League of Corinth ( also known as the Hellenic League or Greek League ) under the guidance of Phillip II , who was elected leader of the first unified Greek state in history .
Shorter , black-and-white daily strips began to appear early in the 20th century , and became established in newspapers after the success in 1907 of Bud Fisher 's Mutt and Jeff . Humour strips predominated at first , and in the 1920s and 1930s strips with continuing stories in genres such as adventure and drama also became popular . Thin periodicals called comic books appeared in the 1930s , at first reprinting newspaper comic strips ; by the end of the decade , original content began to dominate . The success in 1938 of Action Comics and its lead hero Superman marked the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books , in which the superhero genre was prominent .
A strong and prominent a cappella tradition was begun in the midwest part of the United States in 1911 by F. Melius Christiansen , a music faculty member at St. Olaf College in Northfield , Minnesota . The St. Olaf College Choir was established as an outgrowth of the local St. John 's Lutheran Church , where Christiansen was organist and the choir was composed , at least partially , of students from the nearby St. Olaf campus . The success of the ensemble was emulated by other regional conductors , and a rich tradition of a cappella choral music was born in the region at colleges like Concordia College ( Moorhead , Minnesota ) , Augustana College ( Rock Island , Illinois ) , Wartburg College ( Waverly , Iowa ) , Luther College ( Decorah , Iowa ) , Gustavus Adolphus College ( St. Peter , Minnesota ) , Augustana College ( Sioux Falls , South Dakota ) , and Augsburg College ( Minneapolis , Minnesota ) . The choirs typically range from 40 to 80 singers and are recognized for their efforts to perfect blend , intonation , phrasing and pitch in a large choral setting .
According to the latest International Monetary Fund estimates , its per capita GDP ( adjusted for purchasing power ) at $ 30,769 is just above the average of the European Union . [ citation needed ] Cyprus has been sought as a base for several offshore businesses for its low tax rates . Tourism , financial services and shipping are significant parts of the economy . Economic policy of the Cyprus government has focused on meeting the criteria for admission to the European Union . The Cypriot government adopted the euro as the national currency on 1 January 2008 .
Ibn Sina subsequently settled at Rey , in the vicinity of modern Tehran , the home town of Rhazes ; where Majd Addaula , a son of the last Buwayhid emir , was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother ( Seyyedeh Khatun ) . About thirty of Ibn Sina 's shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey . Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son , Shams al-Daula , however , compelled the scholar to quit the place . After a brief sojourn at Qazvin he passed southwards to Hamadãn where Shams al-Daula , another Buwayhid emir , had established himself . At first , Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady ; but the emir , hearing of his arrival , called him in as medical attendant , and sent him back with presents to his dwelling . Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier . The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country . Ibn Sina , however , remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel 's house , until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post . Even during this perturbed time , Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching . Every evening , extracts from his great works , the Canon and the Sanatio , were dictated and explained to his pupils . On the death of the emir , Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an apothecary , where , with intense assiduity , he continued the composition of his works .
Additionally , there are a number of Assistant Chiefs of Defence Staff , including the Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff ( Reserves and Cadets ) and the Defence Services Secretary in the Royal Household of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom , who is also the Assistant Chief of Defence Staff ( Personnel ) .
IBM also had their own DBMS in 1966 , known as Information Management System ( IMS ) . IMS was a development of software written for the Apollo program on the System/360 . IMS was generally similar in concept to CODASYL , but used a strict hierarchy for its model of data navigation instead of CODASYL 's network model . Both concepts later became known as navigational databases due to the way data was accessed , and Bachman 's 1973 Turing Award presentation was The Programmer as Navigator . IMS is classified [ by whom ? ] as a hierarchical database . IDMS and Cincom Systems ' TOTAL database are classified as network databases . IMS remains in use as of 2014 [ update ] .
The axiom of foundation established that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel , in such a manner that if one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession , hence excluding the possibility of a set belonging to itself . To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions , von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration , called the method of inner models , which later became an essential instrument in set theory .
The ancestors of modern bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the first forms of life to appear on Earth , about 4 billion years ago . For about 3 billion years , most organisms were microscopic , and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life . In 2008 , fossils of macroorganisms were discovered and named as the Francevillian biota . Although bacterial fossils exist , such as stromatolites , their lack of distinctive morphology prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution , or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species . However , gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial phylogeny , and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage . Bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence , that of the archaea and eukaryotes . Here , eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into endosymbiotic associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells , which were themselves possibly related to the Archaea . This involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of alphaproteobacterial symbionts to form either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes , which are still found in all known Eukarya ( sometimes in highly reduced form , e.g . in ancient " amitochondrial " protozoa ) . Later on , some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed cyanobacterial-like organisms . This led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants . There are also some algae that originated from even later endosymbiotic events . Here , eukaryotes engulfed a eukaryotic algae that developed into a " second-generation " plastid . This is known as secondary endosymbiosis .
His opponents have attacked Hayek as a leading promoter of " neoliberalism " . A British scholar , Samuel Brittan , concluded in 2010 , " Hayek 's book [ The Constitution of Liberty ] is still probably the most comprehensive statement of the underlying ideas of the moderate free market philosophy espoused by neoliberals . " Brittan adds that although Raymond Plant ( 2009 ) comes out in the end against Hayek 's doctrines , Plant gives The Constitution of Liberty a " more thorough and fair-minded analysis than it has received even from its professed adherents " .
Zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of " exceptional biologic and public health importance " , especially regarding prenatal and postnatal development . Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases . In children it causes growth retardation , delayed sexual maturation , infection susceptibility , and diarrhea . Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry , such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans . Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia , lethargy and copper deficiency .
In the first centuries AD , political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia . Two larger subdivisions appeared : the province ( Estonian : kihelkond ) and the land ( Estonian : maakond ) . Several elderships or villages made up a province . Nearly all provinces had at least one fortress . The king or other highest administrative official elder directed the defense of the local area . By the thirteenth century Estonia consisted of the following provinces : Revala , Harjumaa , Saaremaa , Hiiumaa , Läänemaa , Alempois , Sakala , Ugandi , Jogentagana , Soopoolitse , Vaiga , Mõhu , Nurmekund , Järvamaa and Virumaa .
The bel ( B ) and the smaller decibel ( dB ) are units of measurement of sound intensity invented by Bell Labs and named after him . [ N 28 ] Since 1976 the IEEE 's Alexander Graham Bell Medal has been awarded to honor outstanding contributions in the field of telecommunications .
To the north of China proper , the nomadic Xiongnu chieftain Modu Chanyu ( r. 209–174 BC ) conquered various tribes inhabiting the eastern portion of the Eurasian Steppe . By the end of his reign , he controlled Manchuria , Mongolia , and the Tarim Basin , subjugating over twenty states east of Samarkand . Emperor Gaozu was troubled about the abundant Han-manufactured iron weapons traded to the Xiongnu along the northern borders , and he established a trade embargo against the group . Although the embargo was in place , the Xiongnu found traders willing to supply their needs . Chinese forces also mounted surprise attacks against Xiongnu who traded at the border markets . In retaliation , the Xiongnu invaded what is now Shanxi province , where they defeated the Han forces at Baideng in 200 BC . After negotiations , the heqin agreement in 198 BC nominally held the leaders of the Xiongnu and the Han as equal partners in a royal marriage alliance , but the Han were forced to send large amounts of tribute items such as silk clothes , food , and wine to the Xiongnu .
Critics argue Napoleon 's true legacy must reflect the loss of status for France and needless deaths brought by his rule : historian Victor Davis Hanson writes , " After all , the military record is unquestioned—17 years of wars , perhaps six million Europeans dead , France bankrupt , her overseas colonies lost . " McLynn notes that , " He can be viewed as the man who set back European economic life for a generation by the dislocating impact of his wars . " However , Vincent Cronin replies that such criticism relies on the flawed premise that Napoleon was responsible for the wars which bear his name , when in fact France was the victim of a series of coalitions which aimed to destroy the ideals of the Revolution .
" The mind-stuff of the world is , of course , something more general than our individual conscious minds ... . The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time ; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it ... . It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed , has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness ... . Consciousness is not sharply defined , but fades into subconsciousness ; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature ... . It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character . But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience , and all else is remote inference . "
The philosophies of Buddhism and Zen , and to a lesser extent Confucianism and Shinto , influenced the samurai culture . Zen meditation became an important teaching due to it offering a process to calm one 's mind . The Buddhist concept of reincarnation and rebirth led samurai to abandon torture and needless killing , while some samurai even gave up violence altogether and became Buddhist monks after realizing how fruitless their killings were . Some were killed as they came to terms with these realizations in the battlefield . The most defining role that Confucianism played in samurai philosophy was to stress the importance of the lord-retainer relationship—the loyalty that a samurai was required to show his lord .
In 1926 Joseph P. Maxwell and Henry C. Harrison from Bell Telephone Laboratories disclosed that the recording pattern of the Western Electric " rubber line " magnetic disc cutter had a constant velocity characteristic . This meant that as frequency increased in the treble , recording amplitude decreased . Conversely , in the bass as frequency decreased , recording amplitude increased . Therefore , it was necessary to attenuate the bass frequencies below about 250 Hz , the bass turnover point , in the amplified microphone signal fed to the recording head . Otherwise , bass modulation became excessive and overcutting took place into the next record groove . When played back electrically with a magnetic pickup having a smooth response in the bass region , a complementary boost in amplitude at the bass turnover point was necessary . G. H. Miller in 1934 reported that when complementary boost at the turnover point was used in radio broadcasts of records , the reproduction was more realistic and many of the musical instruments stood out in their true form .
PlayStation 3 uses the Cell microprocessor , designed by Sony , Toshiba and IBM , as its CPU , which is made up of one 3.2 GHz PowerPC-based " Power Processing Element " ( PPE ) and eight Synergistic Processing Elements ( SPEs ) . The eighth SPE is disabled to improve chip yields . Only six of the seven SPEs are accessible to developers as the seventh SPE is reserved by the console 's operating system . Graphics processing is handled by the NVIDIA RSX 'Reality Synthesizer ' , which can produce resolutions from 480i/576i SD up to 1080p HD . PlayStation 3 has 256 MB of XDR DRAM main memory and 256 MB of GDDR3 video memory for the RSX .
Pubs that cater for a niche clientele , such as sports fans or people of certain nationalities are known as theme pubs . Examples of theme pubs include sports bars , rock pubs , biker pubs , Goth pubs , strip pubs , gay bars , karaoke bars and Irish pubs .
Tort law covers the entire imaginable spectrum of wrongs which humans can inflict upon each other , and of course , partially overlaps with wrongs also punishable by criminal law . Although the American Law Institute has attempted to standardize tort law through the development of several versions of the Restatement of Torts , many states have chosen to adopt only certain sections of the Restatements and to reject others . Thus , because of its immense size and diversity , American tort law can not be easily summarized .
Around 10,200 BC the first fully developed Neolithic cultures belonging to the phase Pre-Pottery Neolithic A ( PPNA ) appeared in the fertile crescent . Around 10,700 to 9,400 BC a settlement was established in Tell Qaramel , 10 miles north of Aleppo . The settlement included 2 temples dating back to 9,650 . Around 9000 BC during the PPNA , one of the world 's first towns , Jericho , appeared in the Levant . It was surrounded by a stone and marble wall and contained a population of 2000–3000 people and a massive stone tower . Around 6,400 BC the Halaf culture appeared in Lebanon , Israel and Palestine , Syria , Anatolia , and Northern Mesopotamia and subsisted on dryland agriculture .
Material transport elevators generally consist of an inclined plane on which a conveyor belt runs . The conveyor often includes partitions to ensure that the material moves forward . These elevators are often used in industrial and agricultural applications . When such mechanisms ( or spiral screws or pneumatic transport ) are used to elevate grain for storage in large vertical silos , the entire structure is called a grain elevator . Belt elevators are often used in docks for loading loose materials such as coal , iron ore and grain into the holds of bulk carriers
The main cast was revealed in December 2014 at the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios . Daniel Craig returned for his fourth appearance as James Bond , while Ralph Fiennes , Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw reprised their roles as M , Eve Moneypenny and Q respectively , having been established in Skyfall . Rory Kinnear also reprised his role as Bill Tanner in his third appearance in the series .
The first helicopter landing at the new airfield was conducted by the Wildcat HMA.2 ZZ377 from 825 Squadron 201 Flight , embarked on visiting HMS Lancaster on 23 October 2015 .
DNA samples from 1228 Russians show that the Y chromosomes analyzed , all except 20 ( 1.6 % ) fall into seven major haplogroups all characteristic to West Eurasian populations . Taken together , they account for 95 % of the total Russian Y chromosomal pool . Only ( 0.7 % ) fell into haplogroups that are specific to East and South Asian populations . Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) examined in Poles and Russians revealed the presence of all major European haplogroups , which were characterized by similar patterns of distribution in Poles and Russians . An analysis of the DNA did not reveal any specific combinations of unique mtDNA haplotypes and their subclusters . The DNA clearly shows that both Poles and Russians are not different from the neighbouring European populations .
Immunological research continues to become more specialized , pursuing non-classical models of immunity and functions of cells , organs and systems not previously associated with the immune system ( Yemeserach 2010 ) .
The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on the French colonies abroad . Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars , with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801 . Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens . During the Revolution , the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794 . Under the terms of Amiens , however , Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented . The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane , even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places . The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies , not slavery itself . Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue . Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture , the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army . In May 1803 , the last 8000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Haïti in 1804 . Seeing the failure of his colonial efforts , Napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States , instantly doubling the size of the U.S . The selling price in the Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre , a total of $ 15 million .
The names for the nation of Greece and the Greek people differ from the names used in other languages , locations and cultures . Although the Greeks call the country Hellas or Ellada ( Greek : Ἑλλάς or Ελλάδα ) and its official name is the Hellenic Republic , in English it is referred to as Greece , which comes from the Latin term Graecia as used by the Romans , which literally means 'the land of the Greeks ' , and derives from the Greek name Γραικός . However , the name Hellas is sometimes used in English as well .
Throughout their history , Slavs came into contact with non-Slavic groups . In the postulated homeland region ( present-day Ukraine ) , they had contacts with the Iranic Sarmatians and the Germanic Goths . After their subsequent spread , they began assimilating non-Slavic peoples . For example , in the Balkans , there were Paleo-Balkan peoples , such as Romanized and Hellenized ( Jireček Line ) Illyrians , Thracians and Dacians , as well as Greeks and Celtic Scordisci . Over time , due to the larger number of Slavs , most descendants of the indigenous populations of the Balkans were Slavicized . The Thracians and Illyrians vanished from the population during this period – although the modern Albanian nation claims descent from the Illyrians . Exceptions are Greece , where the lesser numbered Slavs scattered there came to be Hellenized ( aided in time by more Greeks returning to Greece in the 9th century and the role of the church and administration ) and Romania where Slavic people settled en route for present-day Greece , Republic of Macedonia , Bulgaria and East Thrace whereby the Slavic population had come to assimilate . Bulgars were also assimilated by local Slavs but their ruling status and subsequent land cast the nominal legacy of Bulgarian country and people onto all future generations . The Romance speakers within the fortified Dalmatian cities managed to retain their culture and language for a long time , as Dalmatian Romance was spoken until the high Middle Ages . However , they too were eventually assimilated into the body of Slavs .

Average annual precipitation is 15 inches ( 380 mm ) , but great variations are seen . The mountain ranges block the moist Pacific air , holding moisture in the western valleys , and creating rain shadows to the east . Heron , in the west , receives the most precipitation , 34.70 inches ( 881 mm ) . On the eastern ( leeward ) side of a mountain range , the valleys are much drier ; Lonepine averages 11.45 inches ( 291 mm ) , and Deer Lodge 11.00 inches ( 279 mm ) of precipitation . The mountains themselves can receive over 100 inches ( 2,500 mm ) , for example the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park gets 105 inches ( 2,700 mm ) . An area southwest of Belfry averaged only 6.59 inches ( 167 mm ) over a sixteen-year period . Most of the larger cities get 30 to 50 inches or 0.76 to 1.27 metres of snow each year . Mountain ranges themselves can accumulate 300 inches or 7.62 metres of snow during a winter . Heavy snowstorms may occur any time from September through May , though most snow falls from November to March .
PlayStation Portable can connect with PlayStation 3 in many ways , including in-game connectivity . For example , Formula One Championship Edition , a racing game , was shown at E3 2006 using a PSP as a real-time rear-view mirror . In addition , users are able to download original PlayStation format games from the PlayStation Store , transfer and play them on PSP as well as PS3 itself . It is also possible to use the Remote Play feature to play these and some PlayStation Network games , remotely on PSP over a network or internet connection .
The possibility of withdrawal depends on the terms of the treaty and its travaux preparatoire . It has , for example , been held that it is not possible to withdraw from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . When North Korea declared its intention to do this the Secretary-General of the United Nations , acting as registrar , said that original signatories of the ICCPR had not overlooked the possibility of explicitly providing for withdrawal , but rather had deliberately intended not to provide for it . Consequently , withdrawal was not possible .
To Kill a Mockingbird has been a source of significant controversy since its being the subject of classroom study as early as 1963 . The book 's racial slurs , profanity , and frank discussion of rape have led people to challenge its appropriateness in libraries and classrooms across the United States . The American Library Association reported that To Kill a Mockingbird was number 21 of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 2000–2009 .
In 1979 , the committees began the redistribution of land in the Jefara plain , continuing through 1981 . In May 1980 , measures to redistribute and equalize wealth were implemented ; anyone with over 1000 dinar in his bank account saw that extra money expropriated . The following year , the GPC announced that the government would take control of all import , export and distribution functions , with state supermarkets replacing privately owned businesses ; this led to a decline in the availability of consumer goods and the development of a thriving black market .
In the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC , the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries , as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization , converting it into a heavy industry production centre of East China . Overenthusiastic in building a “world-class” industrial city , the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development , such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal , resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s . From 1960s to 1980s there were Five Pillar Industries , namely , electronics , cars , petrochemical , iron and steel , and power , each with big state-owned firms . After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy , the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms , hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of layoff workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless .
In the north , substantial efforts were made against Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Sunderland , which were large ports on the English east coast . On 9 April 1941 Luftflotte 2 dropped 150 tons of high explosives and 50,000 incendiaries from 120 bombers in a five-hour attack . Sewer , rail , docklands , and electric installations were damaged . In Sunderland on 25 April , Luftflotte 2 sent 60 bombers which dropped 80 tons of high explosive and 9,000 incendiaries . Much damage was done . A further attack on the Clyde , this time at Greenock , took place on 6 and 7 May . However , as with the attacks in the south , the Germans failed to prevent maritime movements or cripple industry in the regions .
In music , popular local bands include The Five Stars , Penina o Tiafau and Punialava'a . The Yandall Sisters ' cover of the song Sweet Inspiration reached number one on the New Zealand charts in 1974 . King Kapisi was the first hip hop artist to receive the prestigious New Zealand APRA Silver Scroll Award in 1999 for his song Reverse Resistance . The music video for Reverse Resistance was filmed in Savai'i at his villages . Other successful Samoan hip hop artists include rapper Scribe , Dei Hamo , Savage and Tha Feelstyle whose music video Suamalie was filmed in Samoa .
In the hindgut ( element 16 in numbered diagram ) , or proctodaeum , undigested food particles are joined by uric acid to form fecal pellets . The rectum absorbs 90 % of the water in these fecal pellets , and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus ( element 17 ) , completing the process of digestion . The uric acid is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the Malpighian tubules ( element 20 ) . It is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal , at the junction between the midgut and hindgut . The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species , ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others . :71–72 , 78–80
The League of American Bicyclists gave Tucson a gold rating for bicycle friendliness in late April 2007 . Tucson hosts the largest perimeter cycling event in the United States . The ride called " El Tour de Tucson " happens in November on the Saturday before Thanksgiving . El Tour de Tucson produced and promoted by Perimeter Bicycling has as many as 10,000 participants from all over the world , annually . Tucson is one of only nine cities in the U.S. to receive a gold rating or higher for cycling friendliness from the League of American Bicyclists . The city is known for its winter cycling opportunities . Both road and mountain biking are popular in and around Tucson with trail areas including Starr Pass and Fantasy Island .
Since the end of the Second World War , France has become an ethnically diverse country . Today , approximately five percent of the French population is non-European and non-white . This does not approach the number of non-white citizens in the United States ( roughly 28–37 % , depending on how Latinos are classified ; see Demographics of the United States ) . Nevertheless , it amounts to at least three million people , and has forced the issues of ethnic diversity onto the French policy agenda . France has developed an approach to dealing with ethnic problems that stands in contrast to that of many advanced , industrialized countries . Unlike the United States , Britain , or even the Netherlands , France maintains a " color-blind " model of public policy . This means that it targets virtually no policies directly at racial or ethnic groups . Instead , it uses geographic or class criteria to address issues of social inequalities . It has , however , developed an extensive anti-racist policy repertoire since the early 1970s . Until recently , French policies focused primarily on issues of hate speech—going much further than their American counterparts—and relatively less on issues of discrimination in jobs , housing , and in provision of goods and services .
The Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) is the British government department responsible for implementing the defence policy set by Her Majesty 's Government , and is the headquarters of the British Armed Forces .
The primary site of infection in the lungs , known as the " Ghon focus " , is generally located in either the upper part of the lower lobe , or the lower part of the upper lobe . Tuberculosis of the lungs may also occur via infection from the blood stream . This is known as a Simon focus and is typically found in the top of the lung . This hematogenous transmission can also spread infection to more distant sites , such as peripheral lymph nodes , the kidneys , the brain , and the bones . All parts of the body can be affected by the disease , though for unknown reasons it rarely affects the heart , skeletal muscles , pancreas , or thyroid .
Melbourne has a highly diversified economy with particular strengths in finance , manufacturing , research , IT , education , logistics , transportation and tourism . Melbourne houses the headquarters for many of Australia 's largest corporations , including five of the ten largest in the country ( based on revenue ) , and four of the largest six in the country ( based on market capitalisation ) ( ANZ , BHP Billiton ( the world 's largest mining company ) , the National Australia Bank and Telstra ) , as well as such representative bodies and think tanks as the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Council of Trade Unions . Melbourne 's suburbs also have the Head Offices of Wesfarmers companies Coles ( including Liquorland ) , Bunnings , Target , K-Mart & Officeworks . The city is home to Australia 's largest and busiest seaport which handles more than $ 75 billion in trade every year and 39 % of the nation 's container trade . Melbourne Airport provides an entry point for national and international visitors , and is Australia 's second busiest airport . [ citation needed ]
Selenizza is a naturally occurring solid hydrocarbon bitumen found in the native asphalt deposit of Selenice , in Albania , the only European asphalt mine still in use . The rock asphalt is found in the form of veins , filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction . The bitumen content varies from 83 % to 92 % ( soluble in carbon disulphide ) , with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point ( ring & ball ) around 120 °C . The insoluble matter , consisting mainly of silica ore , ranges from 8 % to 17 % .
In addition to these institutions , Swaziland also has the Swaziland Institute of Management and Public Administration ( SIMPA ) and Institute of Development Management ( IDM ) . SIMPA is a government owned management and development institute and IDM is a regional organisation in Botswana , Lesotho and Swaziland that provides training , consultancy , and research in management . The Mananga management centre was established as Mananga Agricultural Management Centre in 1972 as an International Management Development Centre catering for middle and senior managers , it is located at Ezulwini .
Plants synthesize a number of unique polymers like the polysaccharide molecules cellulose , pectin and xyloglucan from which the land plant cell wall is constructed . Vascular land plants make lignin , a polymer used to strengthen the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels to keep them from collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress . Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibers that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood . Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record . It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period . The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today is much lower than it was when plants emerged onto land during the Ordovician and Silurian periods . Many monocots like maize and the pineapple and some dicots like the Asteraceae have since independently evolved pathways like Crassulacean acid metabolism and the C4 carbon fixation pathway for photosynthesis which avoid the losses resulting from photorespiration in the more common C3 carbon fixation pathway . These biochemical strategies are unique to land plants .
As of 2015 , the government structure of the New Delhi Municipal Council includes a chairperson , three members of New Delhi 's Legislative Assembly , two members nominated by the Chief Minister of the NCT of Delhi and five members nominated by the central government .
Detroit techno is an offshoot of Chicago house music . It was developed starting in the late 80s , one of the earliest hits being " Big Fun " by Inner City . Detroit techno developed as the legendary disc jockey The Electrifying Mojo conducted his own radio program at this time , influencing the fusion of eclectic sounds into the signature Detroit techno sound . This sound , also influenced by European electronica ( Kraftwerk , Art of Noise ) , Japanese synthpop ( Yellow Magic Orchestra ) , early B-boy Hip-Hop ( Man Parrish , Soul Sonic Force ) and Italo disco ( Doctor 's Cat , Ris , Klein M.B.O . ) , was further pioneered by Juan Atkins , Derrick May , and Kevin Saunderson , the " godfathers " of Detroit Techno .

There are some theories on emotions arguing that cognitive activity in the form of judgments , evaluations , or thoughts are necessary in order for an emotion to occur . A prominent philosophical exponent is Robert C. Solomon ( for example , The Passions , Emotions and the Meaning of Life , 1993 ) . Solomon claims that emotions are judgments . He has put forward a more nuanced view which response to what he has called the ‘standard objection’ to cognitivism , the idea that a judgment that something is fearsome can occur with or without emotion , so judgment can not be identified with emotion . The theory proposed by Nico Frijda where appraisal leads to action tendencies is another example .
In what was to become a tradition , Clarkson performed the coronation song during the finale , and released the song immediately after the season ended . The single , " A Moment Like This " , went on to break a 38-year-old record held by The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 . Guarini did not release any song immediately after the show and remains the only runner-up not to do so . Both Clarkson and Guarini made a musical film , From Justin to Kelly , which was released in 2003 but was widely panned . Clarkson has since become the most successful Idol contestant internationally , with worldwide album sales of more than 23 million .
An earthworm 's digestive system consists of a mouth , pharynx , esophagus , crop , gizzard , and intestine . The mouth is surrounded by strong lips , which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass , leaves , and weeds , with bits of soil to help chew . The lips break the food down into smaller pieces . In the pharynx , the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage . The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay . Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed . The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt . When the churning is complete , the glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste , which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter . By peristalsis , the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown . This releases carbohydrates , protein , fat , and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body .
In 1975 , the first practical solar boat was constructed in England . By 1995 , passenger boats incorporating PV panels began appearing and are now used extensively . In 1996 , Kenichi Horie made the first solar powered crossing of the Pacific Ocean , and the sun21 catamaran made the first solar powered crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in the winter of 2006–2007 . There were plans to circumnavigate the globe in 2010 .
The infinitive form ends in t ( archaically , ti ) . It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs ( for example , můžu tě slyšet— " I can hear you " ) . Czech verbs have three grammatical moods : indicative , imperative and conditional . The imperative mood adds specific endings for each of three person ( or number ) categories : -Ø/-i/-ej for second-person singular , -te/-ete/-ejte for second-person plural and -me/-eme/-ejme for first-person plural . The conditional mood is formed with a particle after the past-tense verb . This mood indicates possible events , expressed in English as " I would " or " I wish " .
The George Washington Bridge is the world 's busiest motor vehicle bridge , connecting Manhattan to Bergen County , New Jersey . The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the Americas and one of the world 's longest . The Brooklyn Bridge is an icon of the city itself . The towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are built of limestone , granite , and Rosendale cement , and their architectural style is neo-Gothic , with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers . This bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903 , and is the first steel-wire suspension bridge .
The first military unit of the Ottoman State was an army that was organized by Osman I from the tribesmen inhabiting the hills of western Anatolia in the late 13th century . The military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the Empire . The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding . The main corps of the Ottoman Army included Janissary , Sipahi , Akıncı and Mehterân . The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world , being one of the first to use muskets and cannons . The Ottoman Turks began using falconets , which were short but wide cannons , during the Siege of Constantinople . The Ottoman cavalry depended on high speed and mobility rather than heavy armour , using bows and short swords on fast Turkoman and Arabian horses ( progenitors of the Thoroughbred racing horse ) , and often applied tactics similar to those of the Mongol Empire , such as pretending to retreat while surrounding the enemy forces inside a crescent-shaped formation and then making the real attack . The decline in the army 's performance became clear from the mid-17th century and after the Great Turkish War . The 18th century saw some limited success against Venice , but in the north the European-style Russian armies forced the Ottomans to concede land .
The city has started moving away from the automobile and towards mass transit . From 2004 to 2009 , the annual number of unlinked public transportation trips increased by approximately 21 % . In 2006 , voters in King County passed proposition 2 ( Transit Now ) which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for five bus rapid transit lines called RapidRide . After rejecting a roads and transit measure in 2007 , Seattle-area voters passed a transit only measure in 2008 to increase ST Express bus service , extend the Link Light Rail system , and expand and improve Sounder commuter rail service . A light rail line from downtown heading south to Sea-Tac Airport began service on December 19 , 2009 , giving the city its first rapid transit line with intermediate stations within the city limits . An extension north to the University of Washington is scheduled to open in 2016 ; and further extensions are planned to reach Lynnwood to the north , Des Moines to the south , and Bellevue and Redmond to the east by 2023 . Former mayor Michael McGinn has supported building light rail from downtown to Ballard and West Seattle .
Tensions over rising Polish nationalism and the economic effects of the Continental System led to renewed confrontation with Russia . To enforce his blockade , Napoleon launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812 . The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic collapse of the Grand Army , forcing the French to retreat , as well as leading to the widespread destruction of Russian lands and cities . In 1813 , Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France . A chaotic military campaign in Central Europe eventually culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October . The next year , the Allies invaded France and captured Paris , forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814 . He was exiled to the island of Elba . The Bourbons were restored to power and the French lost most of the territories that they had conquered since the Revolution . However , Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of the government once again . The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition , which ultimately defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June . The Royal Navy then thwarted his planned escape to the United States in July , so he surrendered to the British after running out of other options . The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic . His death in 1821 at the age of 51 was received with shock and grief throughout Europe . In 1840 , a million people witnessed his remains returning to Paris , where they still reside at Les Invalides .
With the help of Charles Stearn , an expert on vacuum pumps , in 1878 , Swan developed a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening . This received a British Patent in 1880 . [ dubious – discuss ] On 18 December 1878 , a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown at a meeting of the Newcastle Chemical Society , and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879 . It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879 . These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament . Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current , so they were not commercially practical , although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum , a carbon conductor , and platinum lead-in wires . Besides requiring too much current for a central station electric system to be practical , they had a very short lifetime . Swan turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends . He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread ' and obtained British Patent 4933 in 1880 . From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England . His house was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power . In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity . In the early 1880s he had started his company . In 1881 , the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster , London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs , which was the first theatre , and the first public building in the world , to be lit entirely by electricity .

According to the canonical gospels , Jesus , whom Christians believe to be the Son of God as well as the Messiah ( Christ ) , was arrested , tried , and sentenced by Pontius Pilate to be scourged , and finally crucified by the Romans . Jesus was stripped of his clothing and offered wine mixed with gall to drink , before being crucified . He was then hung for six hours ( according to Mark 's Gospel ) between two convicted thieves . During this time , the soldiers affixed a sign to the top of the cross stating " Jesus of Nazareth , King of the Jews " in three languages . They then divided his garments among them , but cast lots for his seamless robe . After Jesus ' death they pierced his side with a spear to be certain that he had died . The Bible records seven statements that Jesus made while he was on the cross , as well as several supernatural events that occurred .
The group changed their name to Destiny 's Child in 1996 , based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah . In 1997 , Destiny 's Child released their major label debut song " Killing Time " on the soundtrack to the 1997 film , Men in Black . The following year , the group released their self-titled debut album , scoring their first major hit " No , No , No " . The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry , with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R & B/Soul Album of the Year , Best R & B/Soul or Rap New Artist , and Best R & B/Soul Single for " No , No , No " . The group released their multi-platinum second album The Writing 's on the Wall in 1999 . The record features some of the group 's most widely known songs such as " Bills , Bills , Bills " , the group 's first number-one single , " Jumpin ' Jumpin ' " and " Say My Name " , which became their most successful song at the time , and would remain one of their signature songs . " Say My Name " won the Best R & B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R & B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards . The Writing 's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide . During this time , Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson , an original member of Boyz II Men , on the song " After All Is Said and Done " for the soundtrack to the 1999 film , The Best Man .
Technicolor ( formerly called Thomson Consumer Electronics ) claims to control MP3 licensing of the Layer 3 patents in many countries , including the United States , Japan , Canada and EU countries . Technicolor has been actively enforcing these patents .
The earthquake had a magnitude of 8.0 Ms and 7.9 Mw . The epicenter was in Wenchuan County , Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture , 80 km west/northwest of the provincial capital of Chengdu , with its main tremor occurring at 14:28:01.42 China Standard Time ( 06:28:01.42 UTC ) , on May 12 , 2008 lasting for around 2 minutes , in the quake almost 80 % of buildings were destroyed .
On October 1 , 1989 , a peaceful demonstration of 10,000 to 15,000 people was violently dispersed by the militia in front of Lviv 's Druzhba Stadium , where a concert celebrating the Soviet " reunification " of Ukrainian lands was being held . On October 10 , Ivano-Frankivsk was the site of a pre-election protest attended by 30,000 people . On October 15 , several thousand people gathered in Chervonohrad , Chernivtsi , Rivne , and Zhytomyr ; 500 in Dnipropetrovsk ; and 30,000 in Lviv to protest the election law . On October 20 , faithful and clergy of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church participated in a synod in Lviv , the first since its forced liquidation in the 1930s .
Other pre-modern Chinese names for Tibet include Wusiguo ( Chinese : 烏斯國 ; pinyin : Wūsīguó ; cf . Tibetan dbus , Ü , [ wyʔ˨˧˨ ] ) , Wusizang ( Chinese : 烏斯藏 ; pinyin : wūsīzàng , cf . Tibetan dbus-gtsang , Ü-Tsang ) , Tubote ( Chinese : 圖伯特 ; pinyin : Túbótè ) , and Tanggute ( Chinese : 唐古忒 ; pinyin : Tánggǔtè , cf . Tangut ) . American Tibetologist Elliot Sperling has argued in favor of a recent tendency by some authors writing in Chinese to revive the term Tubote ( simplified Chinese : 图伯特 ; traditional Chinese : 圖伯特 ; pinyin : Túbótè ) for modern use in place of Xizang , on the grounds that Tubote more clearly includes the entire Tibetan plateau rather than simply the Tibet Autonomous Region .

Following the announcement of Nasser 's death , Egypt and the Arab world were in a state of shock . Nasser 's funeral procession through Cairo on 1 October was attended by at least five million mourners . The 10-kilometer ( 6.2 mi ) procession to his burial site began at the old RCC headquarters with a flyover by MiG-21 jets . His flag-draped coffin was attached to a gun carriage pulled by six horses and led by a column of cavalrymen . All Arab heads of state attended , with the exception of Saudi King Faisal . King Hussein and Arafat cried openly , and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya fainted from emotional distress twice . A few major non-Arab dignitaries were present , including Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin and French Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas .
The epidermis is typically 10 to 30 cells thick ; its main function is to provide a waterproof layer . Its outermost cells are constantly lost ; its bottommost cells are constantly dividing and pushing upward . The middle layer , the dermis , is 15 to 40 times thicker than the epidermis . The dermis is made up of many components , such as bony structures and blood vessels . The hypodermis is made up of adipose tissue . Its job is to store lipids , and to provide cushioning and insulation . The thickness of this layer varies widely from species to species .
Insects can be divided into two groups historically treated as subclasses : wingless insects , known as Apterygota , and winged insects , known as Pterygota . The Apterygota consist of the primitively wingless order of the silverfish ( Thysanura ) . Archaeognatha make up the Monocondylia based on the shape of their mandibles , while Thysanura and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia . The Thysanura themselves possibly are not monophyletic , with the family Lepidotrichidae being a sister group to the Dicondylia ( Pterygota and the remaining Thysanura ) .
Prior to Einstein 's paper , electromagnetic radiation such as visible light was considered to behave as a wave : hence the use of the terms " frequency " and " wavelength " to characterise different types of radiation . The energy transferred by a wave in a given time is called its intensity . The light from a theatre spotlight is more intense than the light from a domestic lightbulb ; that is to say that the spotlight gives out more energy per unit time and per unit space ( and hence consumes more electricity ) than the ordinary bulb , even though the colour of the light might be very similar . Other waves , such as sound or the waves crashing against a seafront , also have their own intensity . However , the energy account of the photoelectric effect did n't seem to agree with the wave description of light .
Chasetown , whilst playing at Level 8 of English football during the 2007–08 competition , are the lowest-ranked team to play in the Third Round Proper ( final 64 , of 731 teams entered that season ) . Chasetown was then a member of the Southern League Division One Midlands ( a lower level within the Southern Football League ) , when they lost to Football League Championship ( Level 2 ) team Cardiff City , the eventual FA Cup runners-up that year . Their success earned the lowly organisation over £60,000 in prize money .
New York City traces its roots to its 1624 founding as a trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 1626 . The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 . New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790 . It has been the country 's largest city since 1790 . The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a globally recognized symbol of the United States and its democracy .
In the 2005–06 season , Barcelona repeated their league and Supercup successes . The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid . It was Frank Rijkaard 's second victory at the Bernabéu , making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice . Ronaldinho 's performance was so impressive that after his second goal , which was Barcelona 's third , some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation . In the Champions League , Barcelona beat the English club Arsenal in the final . Trailing 1–0 to a 10-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining , they came back to win 2–1 , with substitute Henrik Larsson , in his final appearance for the club , setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti , for the club 's first European Cup victory in 14 years .
The person or organization submits a HCP and if approved by the agency ( FWS or NMFS ) , will be issued an Incidental Take Permit ( ITP ) which allows a certain number of " takes " of the listed species . The permit may be revoked at any time and can allow incidental takes for varying amounts of time . For instance , the San Bruno Habitat Conservation Plan/ Incidental Take Permit is good for 30 years and the Wal-Mart store ( in Florida ) permit expires after one year . Because the permit is issued by a federal agency to a private party , it is a federal action-which means other federal laws can apply , such as the National Environmental Policy Act or NEPA . A notice of the permit application action is published in the Federal Register and a public comment period of 30 to 90 days begins .
Racial discrimination continued to be enacted in new laws in the 20th century , for instance the one-drop rule was enacted in Virginia 's 1924 Racial Integrity Law and in other southern states , in part influenced by the popularity of eugenics and ideas of racial purity . People buried fading memories that many whites had multiracial ancestry . Many families were multiracial . Similar laws had been proposed but not passed in the late nineteenth century in South Carolina and Virginia , for instance . After regaining political power in Southern states by disenfranchising blacks , white Democrats passed laws to impose Jim Crow and racial segregation to restore white supremacy . They maintained these until forced to change in the 1960s and after by enforcement of federal legislation authorizing oversight of practices to protect the constitutional rights of African Americans and other minority citizens .
On September 23 , 1908 , the Cubs and New York Giants were involved in a tight pennant race . The two clubs were tied in the bottom of the ninth inning at the Polo Grounds , and N.Y. had runners on first and third and two outs when Al Bridwell singled , scoring Moose McCormick from third with the Giants ' apparent winning run , but the runner on first base , rookie Fred Merkle , left the field without touching second base . As fans swarmed the field , Cub infielder Johnny Evers retrieved the ball and touched second . Since there were two outs , a forceout was called at second base , ending the inning and the game . Because of the tie the Giants and Cubs ended up tied for first place . The Giants lost the ensuing one-game playoff and the Cubs went on to the World Series .
American Idol has traditionally released studio recordings of contestants ' performances as well as the winner 's coronation single for sale . For the first five seasons , the recordings were released as a compilation album at the end of the season . All five of these albums reached the top ten in Billboard 200 which made then American Idol the most successful soundtrack franchise of any motion picture or television program . Starting late in season five , individual performances were released during the season as digital downloads , initially from the American Idol official website only . In season seven the live performances and studio recordings were made available during the season from iTunes when it joined as a sponsor . In Season ten the weekly studio recordings were also released as compilation digital album straight after performance night .
Milena Sterio , American expert of international law , includes the former axis powers ( Germany , Italy and Japan ) and India among the great powers along with the permanent members of the UNSC . She considers Germany , Japan and Italy to be great powers due to their G7 membership and because of their influence in regional and international organizations . Various authors describe Italy as an equal major power , while others view Italy as an " intermittent great power " or as " the least of the great powers " .
Lighthouse Point Park , a public beach run by the city , was a popular tourist destination during the Roaring Twenties , attracting luminaries of the period such as Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb . The park remains popular among New Haveners , and is home to the Five Mile Point Lighthouse , constructed in 1847 , and the Lighthouse Point Carousel , constructed in 1916 . Five Mile Point Light was decommissioned in 1877 following the construction of Southwest Ledge Light at the entrance of the harbor , which remains in service to this day . Both of the lighthouses and the carousel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .
All the electromagnetic motors , and that includes the types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector product of the interacting fields . For calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the air gap . Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using FEA or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector . The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current . This makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed .
Baptist missionary work in Canada began in the British colony of Nova Scotia ( present day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick ) in the 1760s . The first official record of a Baptist church in Canada was that of the Horton Baptist Church ( now Wolfville ) in Wolfville , Nova Scotia on 29 October 1778 . The church was established with the assistance of the New Light evangelist Henry Alline . Many of Alline 's followers , after his death , would convert and strengthen the Baptist presence in the Atlantic region . [ page needed ] Two major groups of Baptists formed the basis of the churches in the Maritimes . These were referred to as Regular Baptist ( Calvinistic in their doctrine ) and Free Will Baptists .
A local pioneer of folk song collection in the first half of the 19th century was Shakespearean scholar James Orchard Halliwell , but it was not until the second folk revival in the 20th century that the full range of song from the county , including industrial folk song , began to gain attention . The county produced one of the major figures of the revival in Ewan MacColl , but also a local champion in Harry Boardman , who from 1965 onwards probably did more than anyone to popularise and record the folk song of the county . Perhaps the most influential folk artists to emerge from the region in the late 20th century were Liverpool folk group The Spinners , and from Manchester folk troubadour Roy Harper and musician , comedian and broadcaster Mike Harding . The region is home to numerous folk clubs , many of them catering to Irish and Scottish folk music . Regular folk festivals include the Fylde Folk Festival at Fleetwood .
Like other settled , agrarian societies in history , those in the Indian subcontinent have been attacked by nomadic tribes throughout its long history . In evaluating the impact of Islam on the sub-continent , one must note that the northwestern sub-continent was a frequent target of tribes raiding from Central Asia . In that sense , the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions were not dissimilar to those of the earlier invasions during the 1st millennium . What does however , make the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions different is that unlike the preceding invaders who assimilated into the prevalent social system , the successful Muslim conquerors retained their Islamic identity and created new legal and administrative systems that challenged and usually in many cases superseded the existing systems of social conduct and ethics , even influencing the non-Muslim rivals and common masses to a large extent , though non-Muslim population was left to their own laws and customs . They also introduced new cultural codes that in some ways were very different from the existing cultural codes . This led to the rise of a new Indian culture which was mixed in nature , though different from both the ancient Indian culture and later westernized modern Indian culture . At the same time it must be noted that overwhelming majority of Muslims in India are Indian natives converted to Islam . This factor also played an important role in the synthesis of cultures .
Guam ( i/ˈɡwɑːm/ or /ˈɡwɒm/ ; Chamorro : Guåhån ; [ needs IPA ] formally the Territory of Guam ) is an unincorporated and organized territory of the United States . Located in the northwestern Pacific Ocean , Guam is one of five American territories with an established civilian government . The capital city is Hagåtña , and the most populous city is Dededo . In 2015 , 161,785 people resided on Guam . Guamanians are American citizens by birth . Guam has an area of 544 km2 ( 210 sq mi ) and a density of 297/km² ( 770/sq mi ) . It is the largest and southernmost of the Mariana Islands , and the largest island in Micronesia . Among its municipalities , Mongmong-Toto-Maite has the highest density at 1,425/km² ( 3,691/sq mi ) , whereas Inarajan and Umatac have the lowest density at 47/km² ( 119/sq mi ) . The highest point is Mount Lamlam at 406 meters ( 1,332 ft ) above sea level .
An example of the first view is the regulation of attorneys and judges , and the establishment of rules for the conduct of the courts , by the Congress and in the states the legislatures . Although in practice these matters are delegated to the Supreme Court , the Congress holds these powers and delegates them to the Supreme Court only for convenience in light of the Supreme Court 's expertise , but can withdraw that delegation at any time .
North Carolina Museum of Art , occupying a large suburban campus on Blue Ridge Road near the North Carolina State Fairgrounds , maintains one of the premier public art collections located between Washington , D.C. , and Atlanta . In addition to its extensive collections of American Art , European Art and ancient art , the museum recently has hosted major exhibitions featuring Auguste Rodin ( in 2000 ) and Claude Monet ( in 2006-07 ) , each attracting more than 200,000 visitors . Unlike most prominent public museums , the North Carolina Museum of Art acquired a large number of the works in its permanent collection through purchases with public funds . The museum 's outdoor park is one of the largest such art parks in the country . The museum facility underwent a major expansion which greatly expanded the exhibit space that was completed in 2010 . The 127,000 sf new expansion is designed by NYC architect Thomas Phifer and Partners .
The Axis states which assisted Japan included the authoritarian government of Thailand in World War II , which quickly formed a temporary alliance with the Japanese in 1941 , as the Japanese forces were already invading the peninsula of southern Thailand . The Phayap Army sent troops to invade and occupy northeastern Burma , which was former Thai territory that had been annexed by Britain much earlier . Also involved were the Japanese puppet states of Manchukuo and Mengjiang ( consisting of most of Manchuria and parts of Inner Mongolia respectively ) , and the collaborationist Wang Jingwei regime ( which controlled the coastal regions of China ) .
The following year , when Philip Graves , the Constantinople ( modern Istanbul ) correspondent of The Times , exposed The Protocols as a forgery , The Times retracted the editorial of the previous year .
This age saw the Greeks move towards larger cities and a reduction in the importance of the city-state . These larger cities were parts of the still larger Kingdoms of the Diadochi . Greeks , however , remained aware of their past , chiefly through the study of the works of Homer and the classical authors . An important factor in maintaining Greek identity was contact with barbarian ( non-Greek ) peoples , which was deepened in the new cosmopolitan environment of the multi-ethnic Hellenistic kingdoms . This led to a strong desire among Greeks to organize the transmission of the Hellenic paideia to the next generation . Greek science , technology and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period .
Microsoft Windows 3.0 was released in May 1990 , and according to a common saying at the time " Windows was not as good as Macintosh , but it was good enough for the average user " . Though still a graphical wrapper that relied upon MS-DOS , 3.0 was the first iteration of Windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the much more expensive Macintosh platform . It also did not help matters that during the previous year Jean-Louis Gassée had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers . Finally , there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding PC industry in 1989 , forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices which dropped Apple 's margins .
Under the early courts , when military conscription had been centrally controlled , military affairs had been taken out of the hands of the provincial aristocracy . But as the system broke down after 792 , local power holders again became the primary source of military strength . The re-establishment of an efficient military system was made gradually through a process of trial-and-error . At that time the imperial court did not possess an army but rather relied on an organization of professional warriors composed mainly of oryoshi , which were appointed to an individual province and tsuibushi , which were appointed over imperial circuits or for specific tasks . This gave rise to the Japanese military class . Nonetheless final authority rested with the imperial court .
Victoria visited mainland Europe regularly for holidays . In 1889 , during a stay in Biarritz , she became the first reigning monarch from Britain to set foot in Spain when she crossed the border for a brief visit . By April 1900 , the Boer War was so unpopular in mainland Europe that her annual trip to France seemed inadvisable . Instead , the Queen went to Ireland for the first time since 1861 , in part to acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war . In July , her second son Alfred ( " Affie " ) died ; " Oh , God ! My poor darling Affie gone too " , she wrote in her journal . " It is a horrible year , nothing but sadness & horrors of one kind & another . "
BYU has been considered by some Latter-day Saints , as well as some university and church leaders , to be " The Lord 's university " . This phrase is used in reference to the school 's mission as an " ambassador " to the world for the LDS Church and thus , for Jesus Christ . In the past , some students and faculty have expressed dissatisfaction with this nickname , stating that it gives students the idea that university authorities are always divinely inspired and never to be contradicted . Leaders of the school , however , acknowledge that the nickname represents more a goal that the university strives for and not its current state of being . Leaders encourage students and faculty to help fulfill the goal by following the teachings of their religion , adhering to the school 's honor code , and serving others with the knowledge they gain while attending .
The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals . Only a few invertebrates such as sponges , jellyfish , adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain ; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead . The brain is located in the head , usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision , hearing , balance , taste , and smell . The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate 's body . In a typical human , the cerebral cortex ( the largest part ) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons , each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons . These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons , which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells .
The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction until late in the 20th century , replacing the phonograph cylinder record–with which it had co-existed from the late 1880s through to the 1920s–by the late 1920s . Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as compact cassette were mass-marketed . By the late 1980s , digital media , in the form of the compact disc , had gained a larger market share , and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991 . From the 1990s to the 2010s , records continued to be manufactured and sold on a much smaller scale , and were especially used by disc jockeys ( DJ ) s , released by artists in some genres , and listened to by a niche market of audiophiles . The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century – 9.2 million records were sold in the U.S. in 2014 , a 260 % increase since 2009 . Likewise , in the UK sales have increased five-fold from 2009 to 2014 .
Canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as Venezuelan extra-heavy and Mexican heavy oil in chemical composition , and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through oil pipelines to the refinery . Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline , diesel fuel , and refined asphalt without any preprocessing . This is particularly common in areas such as the US Gulf coast , where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil , and in areas such as the US Midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined . Given the choice , such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower , and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline . By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over 1.3 million barrels ( 210×10^3 m3 ) per day , of which about 65 % was exported to the United States .
On October 21 , 2008 , Apple reported that only 14.21 % of total revenue for fiscal quarter 4 of year 2008 came from iPods . At the September 9 , 2009 keynote presentation at the Apple Event , Phil Schiller announced total cumulative sales of iPods exceeded 220 million . The continual decline of iPod sales since 2009 has not been a surprising trend for the Apple corporation , as Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer explained in June 2009 : " We expect our traditional MP3 players to decline over time as we cannibalize ourselves with the iPod Touch and the iPhone . " Since 2009 , the company 's iPod sales have continually decreased every financial quarter and in 2013 a new model was not introduced onto the market .
Saint Helena has a 10/3.6 Mbit/s internet link via Intelsat 707 provided by SURE . Serving a population of more than 4,000 , this single satellite link is considered inadequate in terms of bandwidth .
Beginning in the late 1950s and 1960s , architectural phenomenology emerged as an important movement in the early reaction against modernism , with architects like Charles Moore in the USA , Christian Norberg-Schulz in Norway , and Ernesto Nathan Rogers and Vittorio Gregotti in Italy , who collectively popularized an interest in a new contemporary architecture aimed at expanding human experience using historical buildings as models and precedents . Postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials , with the aesthetics of older pre-modern and non-modern styles , from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles . Robert Venturi famously defined postmodern architecture as a " decorated shed " ( an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside ) , and upheld it against modernist and brutalist " ducks " ( buildings with unnecessarily expressive tectonic forms ) .
The thalidomide tragedy resurrected Kefauver 's bill to enhance drug regulation that had stalled in Congress , and the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962 . Manufacturers henceforth had to prove to FDA that their drugs were effective as well as safe before they could go on the US market . The FDA received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices . The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective . An FDA - National Academy of Sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective . A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later .
Despite the dominance of the above formula , there are documented attempts of the financial industry , occurring before the crisis , to address the formula limitations , specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events . The volume " Credit Correlation : Life After Copulas " , published in 2007 by World Scientific , summarizes a 2006 conference held by Merrill Lynch in London where several practitioners attempted to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations . See also the article by Donnelly and Embrechts and the book by Brigo , Pallavicini and Torresetti , that reports relevant warnings and research on CDOs appeared in 2006 .
Tajikistan ( i/tɑːˈdʒiːkᵻstɑːn/ , /təˈdʒiːkᵻstæn/ , or /tæˈdʒiːkiːstæn/ ; Persian : تاجيكستان‎‎ Тоҷикистон [ tɔd͡ʒikɪsˈtɔn ] ) , officially the Republic of Tajikistan ( Persian : جمهورى تاجيكستان‎‎ Tajik : Ҷумҳурии Тоҷикистон , Çumhuriji Toçikiston/Jumhuriyi Tojikiston ; Russian : Респу́блика Таджикистан , Respublika Tadzhikistan ) , is a mountainous , landlocked country in Central Asia with an estimated 8 million people in 2013 , and an area of 143,100 km2 ( 55,300 sq mi ) . It is bordered by Afghanistan to the south , Uzbekistan to the west , Kyrgyzstan to the north , and China to the east . Pakistan lies to the south , separated by the narrow Wakhan Corridor . Traditional homelands of Tajik people included present-day Tajikistan , Afghanistan and Uzbekistan .
Alternatively , or in addition to this practice , the members of an upper house may be indirectly elected by the government or legislature of the component states , as occurred in the United States prior to 1913 , or be actual members or delegates of the state governments , as , for example , is the case in the German Bundesrat and in the Council of the European Union . The lower house of a federal legislature is usually directly elected , with apportionment in proportion to population , although states may sometimes still be guaranteed a certain minimum number of seats .
Internationally , Victoria took a keen interest in the improvement of relations between France and Britain . She made and hosted several visits between the British royal family and the House of Orleans , who were related by marriage through the Coburgs . In 1843 and 1845 , she and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe I at château d'Eu in Normandy ; she was the first British or English monarch to visit a French one since the meeting of Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520 . When Louis Philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844 , he became the first French king to visit a British sovereign . Louis Philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848 , and fled to exile in England . At the height of a revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848 , Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of Osborne House , a private estate on the Isle of Wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped . Demonstrations by Chartists and Irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support , and the scare died down without any major disturbances . Victoria 's first visit to Ireland in 1849 was a public relations success , but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of Irish nationalism .
At least a few insects have nociceptors , cells that detect and transmit sensations of pain . This was discovered in 2003 by studying the variation in reactions of larvae of the common fruitfly Drosophila to the touch of a heated probe and an unheated one . The larvae reacted to the touch of the heated probe with a stereotypical rolling behavior that was not exhibited when the larvae were touched by the unheated probe . Although nociception has been demonstrated in insects , there is no consensus that insects feel pain consciously
A Misratan militia took Gaddafi prisoner , beating him , causing serious injuries ; the events were filmed on a mobile phone . A video appears to picture Gaddafi being poked or stabbed in the rear end " with some kind of stick or knife " or possibly a bayonet . Pulled onto the front of a pick-up truck , he fell off as it drove away . His semi-naked , lifeless body was then placed into an ambulance and taken to Misrata ; upon arrival , he was found to be dead . Official NTC accounts claimed that Gaddafi was caught in a cross-fire and died from his bullet wounds . Other eye-witness accounts claimed that rebels had fatally shot Gaddafi in the stomach ; a rebel identifying himself as Senad el-Sadik el-Ureybi later claimed responsibility . Gaddafi 's son Mutassim , who had also been among the convoy , was also captured , and found dead several hours later , most probably from an extrajudicial execution . Around 140 Gaddafi loyalists were rounded up from the convoy ; tied up and abused , the corpses of 66 were found at the nearby Mahari Hotel , victims of extrajudicial execution . Libya 's chief forensic pathologist , Dr. Othman al-Zintani , carried out the autopsies of Gaddafi , his son and Jabr in the days following their deaths ; although the pathologist initially told the press that Gaddafi had died from a gunshot wound to the head , the autopsy report was not made public .
The Institute also maintains a dozen regional offices around the United Kingdom , it opened its first regional office for the East of England at Cambridge in 1966 .
Sony Music Entertainment Inc.

Traditionally a carnival feast was the last opportunity to eat well before the time of food shortage at the end of the winter during which one was limited to the minimum necessary . On what nowadays is called vastenavond ( the days before fasting ) all the remaining winter stores of lard , butter and meat which were left would be eaten , for it would soon start to rot and decay . The selected livestock had in fact already been slaughtered in November and the meat would be no longer preservable . All the food that had survived the winter had to be eaten to assure that everyone was fed enough to survive until the coming spring would provide new food sources .
" Data on ethnic groups are important for putting into effect a number of federal statutes ( i.e. , enforcing bilingual election rules under the Voting Rights Act ; monitoring and enforcing equal employment opportunities under the Civil Rights Act ) . Data on Ethnic Groups are also needed by local governments to run programs and meet legislative requirements ( i.e. , identifying segments of the population who may not be receiving medical services under the Public Health Act ; evaluating whether financial institutions are meeting the credit needs of minority populations under the Community Reinvestment Act ) . "
In 1968 , Tito offered Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubček to fly to Prague on three hours notice if Dubček needed help in facing down the Soviets . In April 1969 , Tito removed generals Ivan Gošnjak and Rade Hamović in the aftermath of the invasion of Czechoslovakia due to the unpreparedness of the Yugoslav army to respond to a similar invasion of Yugoslavia .
After the defeat of the Confederacy , federal forces remained in Charleston during the city 's reconstruction . The war had shattered the prosperity of the antebellum city . Freed slaves were faced with poverty and discrimination , but a large community of free people of color had been well-established in the city before the war and became the leaders of the postwar Republican Party and its legislators . Men who had been free people of color before the war comprised 26 % of those elected to state and federal office in South Carolina from 1868 to 1876 .
In the period before German colonisation , Samoa produced mostly copra . German merchants and settlers were active in introducing large scale plantation operations and developing new industries , notably cocoa bean and rubber , relying on imported labourers from China and Melanesia . When the value of natural rubber fell drastically , about the end of the Great War ( World War I ) , the New Zealand government encouraged the production of bananas , for which there is a large market in New Zealand .

Each year HHC 's facilities provide about 225,000 admissions , one million emergency room visits and five million clinic visits to New Yorkers . HHC facilities treat nearly one-fifth of all general hospital discharges and more than one third of emergency room and hospital-based clinic visits in New York City .
In 1928 , Nasser went to Alexandria to live with his maternal grandfather and attend the city 's Attarin elementary school . He left in 1929 for a private boarding school in Helwan , and later returned to Alexandria to enter the Ras el-Tin secondary school and to join his father , who was working for the city 's postal service . It was in Alexandria that Nasser became involved in political activism . After witnessing clashes between protesters and police in Manshia Square , he joined the demonstration without being aware of its purpose . The protest , organized by the ultranationalist Young Egypt Society , called for the end of colonialism in Egypt in the wake of the 1923 Egyptian constitution 's annulment by Prime Minister Isma'il Sidqi . Nasser was arrested and detained for a night before his father bailed him out .
In addition to basic uniform clothing , various badges are used by the USAF to indicate a billet assignment or qualification-level for a given assignment . Badges can also be used as merit-based or service-based awards . Over time , various badges have been discontinued and are no longer distributed . Authorized badges include the Shields of USAF Fire Protection , and Security Forces , and the Missile Badge ( or " pocket rocket " ) , which is earned after working in a missile system maintenance or missile operations capacity for at least one year .
In late 1994 , Marvel acquired the comic book distributor Heroes World Distribution to use as its own exclusive distributor . As the industry 's other major publishers made exclusive distribution deals with other companies , the ripple effect resulted in the survival of only one other major distributor in North America , Diamond Comic Distributors Inc . In early 1997 , when Marvel 's Heroes World endeavor failed , Diamond also forged an exclusive deal with Marvel—giving the company its own section of its comics catalog Previews .
By spring 1950 , Stalin believed the strategic situation had changed . The Soviets had detonated their first nuclear bomb in September 1949 ; American soldiers had fully withdrawn from Korea ; the Americans had not intervened to stop the communist victory in China , and Stalin calculated that the Americans would be even less willing to fight in Korea—which had seemingly much less strategic significance . The Soviets had also cracked the codes used by the US to communicate with the US embassy in Moscow , and reading these dispatches convinced Stalin that Korea did not have the importance to the US that would warrant a nuclear confrontation . Stalin began a more aggressive strategy in Asia based on these developments , including promising economic and military aid to China through the Sino–Soviet Friendship , Alliance , and Mutual Assistance Treaty .
Special bundles of the game contain a Wolf Link Amiibo figurine , which unlocks a Wii U-exclusive dungeon called the " Cave of Shadows " and can carry data over to the upcoming 2016 Zelda game .

Even though the Gelug exchanged gifts with and sent missions to the Ming court up until the 1430s , the Gelug was not mentioned in the Mingshi or the Mingshi Lu . On this , historian Li Tieh-tseng says of Tsongkhapa 's refusal of Ming invitations to visit the Yongle Emperor 's court :
Support for the U.S. cooled when America made clear its determination to invade Iraq in late 2002 . Even so , many of the " coalition of the willing " countries that unconditionally supported the U.S.-led military action have sent troops to Afghanistan , particular neighboring Pakistan , which has disowned its earlier support for the Taliban and contributed tens of thousands of soldiers to the conflict . Pakistan was also engaged in the War in North-West Pakistan ( Waziristan War ) . Supported by U.S. intelligence , Pakistan was attempting to remove the Taliban insurgency and al-Qaeda element from the northern tribal areas .
The experience of pain has many cultural dimensions . For instance , the way in which one experiences and responds to pain is related to sociocultural characteristics , such as gender , ethnicity , and age . An aging adult may not respond to pain in the way that a younger person would . Their ability to recognize pain may be blunted by illness or the use of multiple prescription drugs . Depression may also keep the older adult from reporting they are in pain . The older adult may also quit doing activities they love because it hurts too much . Decline in self-care activities ( dressing , grooming , walking , etc . ) may also be indicators that the older adult is experiencing pain . The older adult may refrain from reporting pain because they are afraid they will have to have surgery or will be put on a drug they might become addicted to . They may not want others to see them as weak , or may feel there is something impolite or shameful in complaining about pain , or they may feel the pain is deserved punishment for past transgressions .
Gaddafi briefly studied History at the University of Libya in Benghazi , before dropping out to join the military . Despite his police record , in 1963 he began training at the Royal Military Academy , Benghazi , alongside several like-minded friends from Misrata . The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged Libyans , and Gaddafi recognised it as a potential instrument of political change . Under Idris , Libya 's armed forces were trained by the British military ; this angered Gaddafi , who viewed the British as imperialists , and accordingly he refused to learn English and was rude to the British officers , ultimately failing his exams . British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour , stating their suspicion that he was involved in the assassination of the military academy 's commander in 1963 . Such reports were ignored and Gaddafi quickly progressed through the course .
Among the notable structures in the town are the three forts built by the Swedes for defense purposes . One of these forts , known as Fort Oscar ( formerly Gustav Adolph ) , which overlooks the sea is located on the far side of La Pointe . However , the ruins have been replaced by a modern military building which now houses the local gendarmerie . The other fort known as Fort Karl now presents a very few ruins . The third fort built by the Swedes is the Fort Gustav , which is also seen in ruins strewn around the weather station and the Light House . The fort built in 1787 over a hill slope has ruins of ramparts , guardhouse , munitions depot , wood-burning oven and so forth .

The American Civil War caught both sides unprepared . The Confederacy hoped to win by getting Britain and France to intervene , or else by wearing down the North 's willingness to fight . The U.S. sought a quick victory focused on capturing the Confederate capital at Richmond , Virginia . The Confederates under Robert E. Lee tenaciously defended their capital until the very end . The war spilled across the continent , and even to the high seas . Most of the material and personnel of the South were used up , while the North prospered .
Copper-alloy touch surfaces have natural intrinsic properties to destroy a wide range of microorganisms ( e.g. , E. coli O157 : H7 , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , Staphylococcus , Clostridium difficile , influenza A virus , adenovirus , and fungi ) . Some 355 copper alloys were proven to kill more than 99.9 % of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly . The United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has approved the registrations of these copper alloys as " antimicrobial materials with public health benefits , " which allows manufacturers to legally make claims as to the positive public health benefits of products made with registered antimicrobial copper alloys . In addition , the EPA has approved a long list of antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys , such as bedrails , handrails , over-bed tables , sinks , faucets , door knobs , toilet hardware , computer keyboards , health club equipment , shopping cart handles , etc . ( for a comprehensive list of products , see : Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces # Approved products ) . Copper doorknobs are used by hospitals to reduce the transfer of disease , and Legionnaires ' disease is suppressed by copper tubing in plumbing systems . Antimicrobial copper alloy products are now being installed in healthcare facilities in the U.K. , Ireland , Japan , Korea , France , Denmark , and Brazil [ citation needed ] and in the subway transit system in Santiago , Chile , where copper-zinc alloy handrails will be installed in some 30 stations between 2011–2014 .
Prior to 1871 , the government of the United States regularly entered into treaties with Native Americans but the Indian Appropriations Act of March 3 , 1871 ( ch . 120 , 16 Stat . 563 ) had a rider ( 25 U.S.C . § 71 ) attached that effectively ended the President’s treaty making by providing that no Indian nation or tribe shall be acknowledged as an independent nation , tribe , or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty . The federal government continued to provide similar contractual relations with the Indian tribes after 1871 by agreements , statutes , and executive orders .

The dynasty lost control of peripheral territories bit by bit . In return for promises of support against the British and the French , the Russian Empire took large chunks of territory in the Northeast in 1860 . The period of cooperation between the reformers and the European powers ended with the Tientsin Massacre of 1870 , which was incited by the murder of French nuns set off by the belligerence of local French diplomats . Starting with the Cochinchina Campaign in 1858 , France expanded control of Indochina . By 1883 , France was in full control of the region and had reached the Chinese border . The Sino-French War began with a surprise attack by the French on the Chinese southern fleet at Fuzhou . After that the Chinese declared war on the French . A French invasion of Taiwan was halted and the French were defeated on land in Tonkin at the Battle of Bang Bo . However Japan threatened to enter the war against China due to the Gapsin Coup and China chose to end the war with negotiations . The war ended in 1885 with the Treaty of Tientsin ( 1885 ) and the Chinese recognition of the French protectorate in Vietnam .
As of January 1 , 2008 estimates by the San Diego Association of Governments revealed that the household median income for San Diego rose to $ 66,715 , up from $ 45,733 , and that the city population rose to 1,336,865 , up 9.3 % from 2000 . The population was 45.3 % non-Hispanic whites , down from 78.9 % in 1970 , 27.7 % Hispanics , 15.6 % Asians/Pacific Islanders , 7.1 % blacks , 0.4 % American Indians , and 3.9 % from other races . Median age of Hispanics was 27.5 years , compared to 35.1 years overall and 41.6 years among non-Hispanic whites ; Hispanics were the largest group in all ages under 18 , and non-Hispanic whites constituted 63.1 % of population 55 and older .
There are facilities across the country with research rooms , archival holdings , and microfilms of documents of federal agencies and courts pertinent to each region .
In turn , according to Kozinski 's analysis , the contemporary rule of binding precedent became possible in the U.S. in the nineteenth century only after the creation of a clear court hierarchy ( under the Judiciary Acts ) , and the beginning of regular verbatim publication of U.S. appellate decisions by West Publishing . The rule gradually developed , case-by-case , as an extension of the judiciary 's public policy of effective judicial administration ( that is , in order to efficiently exercise the judicial power ) . The rule of precedent is generally justified today as a matter of public policy , first , as a matter of fundamental fairness , and second , because in the absence of case law , it would be completely unworkable for every minor issue in every legal case to be briefed , argued , and decided from first principles ( such as relevant statutes , constitutional provisions , and underlying public policies ) , which in turn would create hopeless inefficiency , instability , and unpredictability , and thereby undermine the rule of law .
All the major British cities had flourishing department stores by the mid-or late nineteenth century . Increasingly , women became the major shoppers and middle-class households . Kendals ( formerly Kendal Milne & Faulkner ) in Manchester lays claim to being one of the first department stores and is still known to many of its customers as Kendal 's , despite its 2005 name change to House of Fraser . The Manchester institution dates back to 1836 but had been trading as Watts Bazaar since 1796 . At its zenith the store had buildings on both sides of Deansgate linked by a subterranean passage " Kendals Arcade " and an art nouveau tiled food hall . The store was especially known for its emphasis on quality and style over low prices giving it the nickname " the Harrods of the North " , although this was due in part to Harrods acquiring the store in 1919 . Other large Manchester stores included Paulden 's ( currently Debenhams ) and Lewis 's ( now a Primark ) .
Many were surprised by these changes to the CBC schedule , which were apparently intended to attract a younger audience to the network ; some suggested they might alienate the core CBC viewership . Another note of criticism was made when the network decided to move The National in some time zones to simulcast the American version of The One over the summer . This later became a moot point , as The One was taken off the air after two weeks after extremely low American and Canadian ratings , and the newscast resumed its regular schedule .
In the vaulting events , gymnasts sprint down a 25 metres ( 82 ft ) runway , jump onto a spring filled board or perform a roundoff , or handspring entry onto a springboard ( run/ take-off segment ) , land momentarily , inverted on the hands on the vaulting horse , or vaulting table ( pre flight segment ) , then propel themselves forward or backward , off of this platform to a two footed landing ( post flight segment ) . Every gymnast starts at a different point on the vault runway depending on their height and strength . The post flight segment may include one or more multiple saltos or somersaults , and/or twisting movements . A round-off entry vault , called a Yurchenko , is the most common vault in elite level gymnastics . When performing a yurchenko , gymnasts " round-off " so hands are on the runway while the feet land on the springboard ( beatboard ) . From the roundoff position the gymnast travels backwards and executes a backhandspring so that the hands land on the vaulting table . The gymnast then blocks off the vaulting platform into various twisting and/or somersaulting combinations . The post flight segment brings the gymnast to her feet .
To prevent piracy of films , the standard drill of film distribution is to have a movie first released through movie theaters ( theatrical window ) , on average approximately 16 and a half weeks , before having it released to Blu-Ray and DVD ( entering its video window ) . During the theatrical window , digital versions of films are often transported in data storage devices by couriers rather than by data transmission . The data can be encrypted , with the key being made to work only at specific times in order to prevent leakage between screens . Coded Anti-Piracy marks can be added to films to identify the source of illegal copies and shut them down . As a result of these measures , the only versions of films available for piracy during the theatrical window are usually " cams " made by video recordings of the movie screens , which are of inferior quality compared to the original film version .
Elizabeth I of England , primarily interested in trade with the east , collaborated with English merchants to form the first trading companies to the far-flung regions , using their own jargon . Their goals were to obtain trading concessions by treaty . The queen chartered the Company of Merchants of the Levant , shortened to Levant Company , and soon known also as The Turkey Company , in 1581 . In 1582 , the ship The Great Susan transported the first ambassador , William Harebone , to the Ottoman Porte ( government of the Ottoman Empire ) at Constantinople . Compared to Anatolia , Levant also means " land of the rising sun , " but where Anatolia always only meant the projection of land currently occupied by the Republic of Turkey , Levant meant anywhere in the domain ruled by the Ottoman Porte . The East India Company ( short for a much longer formal name ) was chartered in 1600 for trade to the East Indies .
The Supermarine Spitfire was designed and developed in Southampton , evolving from the Schneider trophy-winning seaplanes of the 1920s and 1930s . Its designer , R J Mitchell , lived in the Portswood area of Southampton , and his house is today marked with a blue plaque . Heavy bombing of the factory in September 1940 destroyed it as well as homes in the vicinity , killing civilians and workers . World War II hit Southampton particularly hard because of its strategic importance as a major commercial port and industrial area . Prior to the Invasion of Europe , components for a Mulberry harbour were built here . After D-Day , Southampton docks handled military cargo to help keep the Allied forces supplied , making it a key target of Luftwaffe bombing raids until late 1944 . Southampton docks was featured in the television show 24 : Live Another Day in Day 9 : 9:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m .
Animals typically use the color green as camouflage , blending in with the chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment . Green animals include , especially , amphibians , reptiles , and some fish , birds and insects . Most fish , reptiles , amphibians , and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment . Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment . For example , broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light . Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds , especially . Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments , sometimes caused by diet . This can causes their feces to look green as well . Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins ( lychochromes ) and hemanovadin . Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields . Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one 's skin include biliverdin , the green pigment in bile , and ceruloplasmin , a protein that carries copper ions in chelation .
Galicia is further divided into 53 comarcas , 315 municipalities ( 93 in A Coruña , 67 in Lugo , 92 in Ourense , 62 in Pontevedra ) and 3,778 parishes . Municipalities are divided into parishes , which may be further divided into aldeas ( " hamlets " ) or lugares ( " places " ) . This traditional breakdown into such small areas is unusual when compared to the rest of Spain . Roughly half of the named population entities of Spain are in Galicia , which occupies only 5.8 percent of the country 's area . It is estimated that Galicia has over a million named places , over 40,000 of them being communities .
In descending order of population , Oklahoma 's largest cities in 2010 were : Oklahoma City ( 579,999 , +14.6 % ) , Tulsa ( 391,906 , −0.3 % ) , Norman ( 110,925 , +15.9 % ) , Broken Arrow ( 98,850 , +32.0 % ) , Lawton ( 96,867 , +4.4 % ) , Edmond ( 81,405 , +19.2 % ) , Moore ( 55,081 , +33.9 % ) , Midwest City ( 54,371 , +0.5 % ) , Enid ( 49,379 , +5.0 % ) , and Stillwater ( 45,688 , +17.0 % ) . Of the state 's ten largest cities , three are outside the metropolitan areas of Oklahoma City and Tulsa , and only Lawton has a metropolitan statistical area of its own as designated by the United States Census Bureau , though the metropolitan statistical area of Fort Smith , Arkansas extends into the state .
Finance proved a major problem for the Labour Party during this period ; a " cash for peerages " scandal under Blair resulted in the drying up of many major sources of donations . Declining party membership , partially due to the reduction of activists ' influence upon policy-making under the reforms of Neil Kinnock and Blair , also contributed to financial problems . Between January and March 2008 , the Labour Party received just over £3 million in donations and were £17 million in debt ; compared to the Conservatives ' £6 million in donations and £12 million in debt .
Critics noted in 2013 that Tom Wheeler , the head of the FCC , which has to approve the deal , is the former head of both the largest cable lobbying organization , the National Cable & Telecommunications Association , and as largest wireless lobby , CTIA – The Wireless Association . According to Politico , Comcast " donated to almost every member of Congress who has a hand in regulating it . " The US Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the deal on April 9 , 2014 . The House Judiciary Committee planned its own hearing . On March 6 , 2014 the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division confirmed it was investigating the deal . In March 2014 , the division 's chairman , William Baer , recused himself because he was involved in a prior Comcast NBCUniversal acquisition . Several states ' attorneys general have announced support for the federal investigation . On April 24 , 2015 , Jonathan Sallet , general counsel of the F.C.C. , said that he was going to recommend a hearing before an administrative law judge , equivalent to a collapse of the deal .
These decisions , apparently taken at the Luftflotte or Fliegerkorps level ( see Organisation of the Luftwaffe ( 1933–1945 ) ) , meant attacks on individual targets were gradually replaced by what was , for all intents and purposes , an unrestricted area attack or Terrorangriff ( Terror Attack ) . Part of the reason for this was inaccuracy of navigation . The effectiveness of British countermeasures against Knickebein , which was designed to avoid area attacks , forced the Luftwaffe to resort to these methods . The shift from precision bombing to area attack is indicated in the tactical methods and weapons dropped . KGr 100 increased its use of incendiaries from 13–28 percent . By December , this had increased to 92 percent . Use of incendiaries , which were inherently inaccurate , indicated much less care was taken to avoid civilian property close to industrial sites . Other units ceased using parachute flares and opted for explosive target markers . Captured German air crews also indicated the homes of industrial workers were deliberately targeted .
Wood to be used for construction work is commonly known as lumber in North America . Elsewhere , lumber usually refers to felled trees , and the word for sawn planks ready for use is timber . In Medieval Europe oak was the wood of choice for all wood construction , including beams , walls , doors , and floors . Today a wider variety of woods is used : solid wood doors are often made from poplar , small-knotted pine , and Douglas fir .
Howison 's personal idealism was also called " California Personalism " by others to distinguish it from the " Boston Personalism " which was of Bowne . Howison maintained that both impersonal , monistic idealism and materialism run contrary to the experience of moral freedom . To deny freedom to pursue truth , beauty , and " benignant love " is to undermine every profound human venture , including science , morality , and philosophy . Personalistic idealists Borden Parker Bowne and Edgar S. Brightman and realistic personal theist Saint Thomas Aquinas address a core issue , namely that of dependence upon an infinite personal God .
On January 21 , 2014 IBM announced that company executives would forgo bonuses for fiscal year 2013 . The move came as the firm reported a 5 % drop in sales and 1 % decline in net profit over 2012 . It also committed to a $ 1.2bn plus expansion of its data center and cloud-storage business , including the development of 15 new data centers . After ten successive quarters of flat or sliding sales under Chief Executive Virginia Rometty IBM is being forced to look at new approaches . Said Rometty , “We’ve got to reinvent ourselves like we’ve done in prior generations.”
Historically , the paper was not overtly pro-Tory or Whig , but has been a long time bastion of the English Establishment and empire . The Times adopted a stance described as " peculiarly detached " at the 1945 general election ; although it was increasingly critical of the Conservative Party 's campaign , it did not advocate a vote for any one party . However , the newspaper reverted to the Tories for the next election five years later . It supported the Conservatives for the subsequent three elections , followed by support for both the Conservatives and the Liberal Party for the next five elections , expressly supporting a Con-Lib coalition in 1974 . The paper then backed the Conservatives solidly until 1997 , when it declined to make any party endorsement but supported individual ( primarily Eurosceptic ) candidates .
While the Baptists in total ( counting both blacks and whites ) have maintained the majority in this part of the country ( known as the Bible Belt ) , the population in North Carolina practices a wide variety of faiths , including Judaism , Islam , Baha'i , Buddhism , and Hinduism . As of 2010 the Southern Baptist Church was the biggest denomination , with 4,241 churches and 1,513,000 members ; the second largest was the United Methodist Church , with 660,000 members and 1,923 churches . The third was the Roman Catholic Church , with 428,000 members in 190 congregations . The fourth greatest was the Presbyterian Church ( USA ) , with 186,000 members and 710 congregations ; this denomination was brought by Scots-Irish immigrants who settled the backcountry in the colonial era .
The island has two local newspapers , both of which are available on the Internet . The St Helena Independent has been published since November 2005 . The Sentinel newspaper was introduced in 2012 .
On December 7 , 1989 , the Communist Party of Lithuania under the leadership of Algirdas Brazauskas , split from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and abandoned its claim to have a constitutional " leading role " in politics . A smaller loyalist faction of the Communist Party , headed by hardliner Mykolas Burokevičius , was established and remained affiliated with the CPSU . However , Lithuania’s governing Communist Party was formally independent from Moscow 's control – a first for Soviet Republics and a political earthquake that prompted Gorbachev to arrange a visit to Lithuania the following month in a futile attempt to bring the local party back under control .
The noise-based speed is defined as the exposure that will lead to a given signal-to-noise ratio on individual pixels . Two ratios are used , the 40:1 ( " excellent image quality " ) and the 10:1 ( " acceptable image quality " ) ratio . These ratios have been subjectively determined based on a resolution of 70 pixels per cm ( 178 DPI ) when viewed at 25 cm ( 9.8 inch ) distance . The signal-to-noise ratio is defined as the standard deviation of a weighted average of the luminance and color of individual pixels . The noise-based speed is mostly determined by the properties of the sensor and somewhat affected by the noise in the electronic gain and AD converter .
In May 2008 Microsoft announced that 10 million Xbox 360s had been sold and that it was the " first current generation gaming console " to surpass the 10 million figure in the US . In the US , the Xbox 360 was the leader in current-generation home console sales until June 2008 , when it was surpassed by the Wii . The Xbox 360 has sold a total of 870,000 units in Canada as of August 1 , 2008 . Between January 2011 and October 2013 , the Xbox 360 was the best-selling console in the United States for these 32 consecutive months .
There are many Hokkien speakers among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia as well as in the United States . Many ethnic Han Chinese emigrants to the region were Hoklo from southern Fujian , and brought the language to what is now Burma ( Myanmar ) , Indonesia ( the former Dutch East Indies ) and present day Malaysia and Singapore ( formerly Malaya and the British Straits Settlements ) . Many of the Hokkien dialects of this region are highly similar to Taiwanese and Amoy . Hokkien is reportedly the native language of up to 98.5 % of the Chinese Filipino in the Philippines , among which is known locally as Lan-nang or Lán-lâng-oē ( " Our people’s language " ) . Hokkien speakers form the largest group of Chinese in Singapore , Malaysia and Indonesia . [ citation needed ]
Ectosymbiosis , also referred to as exosymbiosis , is any symbiotic relationship in which the symbiont lives on the body surface of the host , including the inner surface of the digestive tract or the ducts of exocrine glands . Examples of this include ectoparasites such as lice , commensal ectosymbionts such as the barnacles that attach themselves to the jaw of baleen whales , and mutualist ectosymbionts such as cleaner fish .
The English concentrated on the spirit of the events of Christ 's life , not the literality of events . They neither expected nor sought the appearance of the stigmata or any other physical manifestation . They wanted to create in themselves that environment that allowed Jesus to fulfill His divine mission , insofar as they were able . At the center of this environment was love : the love that Christ showed for humanity in becoming human . Christ 's love reveals the mercy of God and His care for His creation . English Dominican mystics sought through this love to become images of God . Love led to spiritual growth that , in turn , reflected an increase in love for God and humanity . This increase in universal love allowed men 's wills to conform to God 's will , just as Christ 's will submitted to the Father 's will .
The Czech people gained widespread national pride during the mid-eighteenth century , inspired by the Age of Enlightenment a half-century earlier . Czech historians began to emphasize their people 's accomplishments from the fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries , rebelling against the Counter-Reformation ( which had denigrated Czech and other non-Latin languages ) . Czech philologists studied sixteenth-century texts , advocating the return of the language to high culture . This period is known as the Czech National Revival ( or Renascence ) .
Nearly all the gasoline sold in the United States today is mixed with 10 percent ethanol , a mix known as E10 , and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends . Ford , DaimlerChrysler , and GM are among the automobile companies that sell flexible-fuel cars , trucks , and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85 % ethanol ( E85 ) . The challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date . The Energy Policy Act of 2005 , which calls for 7.5 billion US gallons ( 28,000,000 m3 ) of biofuels to be used annually by 2012 , will also help to expand the market .
Innate bisexuality is an idea introduced by Sigmund Freud . According to this theory , all humans are born bisexual in a very broad sense of the term , that of incorporating general aspects of both sexes . In Freud 's view , this was true anatomically and therefore also psychologically , with sexual attraction to both sexes being one part of this psychological bisexuality . Freud believed that in the course of sexual development the masculine side would normally become dominant in men and the feminine side in women , but that as adults everyone still has desires derived from both the masculine and the feminine sides of their natures . Freud did not claim that everyone is bisexual in the sense of feeling the same level of sexual attraction to both genders .
The mantle is equivalent to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water , ammonia and methane . As is customary in planetary science , this mixture is referred to as icy even though it is a hot , dense fluid . This fluid , which has a high electrical conductivity , is sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean . The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions , and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice . At a depth of 7000 km , the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones . Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may comprise an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid 'diamonds ' .
Conflict between the Germanic tribes and the forces of Rome under Julius Caesar forced major Germanic tribes to retreat to the east bank of the Rhine . Roman emperor Augustus in 12 BC ordered the conquest of the Germans , but the catastrophic Roman defeat at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest resulted in the Roman Empire abandoning its plans to completely conquer Germany . Germanic peoples in Roman territory were culturally Romanized , and although much of Germany remained free of direct Roman rule , Rome deeply influenced the development of German society , especially the adoption of Christianity by the Germans who obtained it from the Romans . In Roman-held territories with Germanic populations , the Germanic and Roman peoples intermarried , and Roman , Germanic , and Christian traditions intermingled . The adoption of Christianity would later become a major influence in the development of a common German identity .
Subsequent plans to market a Famicom console in North America featuring a keyboard , cassette data recorder , wireless joystick controller and a special BASIC cartridge under the name " Nintendo Advanced Video System " likewise never materialized . By the beginning of 1985 , the Famicom had sold more than 2.5 million units in Japan and Nintendo soon announced plans to release it in North America as the Advanced Video Entertainment System ( AVS ) that same year . The American video game press was skeptical that the console could have any success in the region , with the March 1985 issue of Electronic Games magazine stating that " the videogame market in America has virtually disappeared " and that " this could be a miscalculation on Nintendo 's part . "
Since the late 18th century , Paris has been famous for its restaurants and haute cuisine , food meticulously prepared and artfully presented . A luxury restaurant , La Taverne Anglaise , opened in 1786 in the arcades of the Palais-Royal by Antoine Beauvilliers ; it featured an elegant dining room , an extensive menu , linen tablecloths , a large wine list and well-trained waiters ; it became a model for future Paris restaurants . The restaurant Le Grand Véfour in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period . The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century , including the Café de Paris , the Rocher de Cancale , the Café Anglais , Maison Dorée and the Café Riche , were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens ; they were immortalised in the novels of Balzac and Émile Zola . Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the Belle Epoque , including Maxim 's on Rue Royale , Ledoyen in the gardens of the Champs-Élysées , and the Tour d'Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle .
Based on studies of these bronze inscriptions , it is clear that , from the Shang dynasty writing to that of the Western Zhou and early Eastern Zhou , the mainstream script evolved in a slow , unbroken fashion , until assuming the form that is now known as seal script in the late Eastern Zhou in the state of Qin , without any clear line of division . Meanwhile , other scripts had evolved , especially in the eastern and southern areas during the late Zhou dynasty , including regional forms , such as the gǔwén ( " ancient forms " ) of the eastern Warring States preserved as variant forms in the Han dynasty character dictionary Shuowen Jiezi , as well as decorative forms such as bird and insect scripts .
At the homestead , Bell set up his own workshop in the converted carriage house near to what he called his " dreaming place " , a large hollow nestled in trees at the back of the property above the river . Despite his frail condition upon arriving in Canada , Bell found the climate and environs to his liking , and rapidly improved . [ N 10 ] He continued his interest in the study of the human voice and when he discovered the Six Nations Reserve across the river at Onondaga , he learned the Mohawk language and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols . For his work , Bell was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a Mohawk headdress and danced traditional dances . [ N 11 ]
In 2007 the German professor Bassam Tibi suggested that the Rohingya conflict may be driven by an Islamist political agenda to impose religious laws , while non-religious causes have also been raised , such as a lingering resentment over the violence that occurred during the Japanese occupation of Burma in World War II—during this time period the British allied themselves with the Rohingya and fought against the puppet government of Burma ( composed mostly of Bamar Japanese ) that helped to establish the Tatmadaw military organisation that remains in power as of March 2013 .
High-voltage AC overhead systems are not only for standard gauge national networks . The meter gauge Rhaetian Railway ( RhB ) and the neighbouring Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn ( MGB ) operate on 11 kV at 16.7 Hz frequency . Practice has proven that both Swiss and German 15 kV trains can operate under these lower voltages . The RhB started trials of the 11 kV system in 1913 on the Engadin line ( St. Moritz-Scuol/Tarasp ) . The MGB constituents Furka-Oberalp-Bahn ( FO ) and Brig-Visp-Zermatt Bahn ( BVZ ) introduced their electric services in 1941 and 1929 respectively , adopting the already proven RhB system .
United States President Barack Obama and key advisers introduced a series of regulatory proposals in June 2009 . The proposals address consumer protection , executive pay , bank financial cushions or capital requirements , expanded regulation of the shadow banking system and derivatives , and enhanced authority for the Federal Reserve to safely wind-down systemically important institutions , among others . In January 2010 , Obama proposed additional regulations limiting the ability of banks to engage in proprietary trading . The proposals were dubbed " The Volcker Rule " , in recognition of Paul Volcker , who has publicly argued for the proposed changes .
Some critics of intellectual property , such as those in the free culture movement , point at intellectual monopolies as harming health ( in the case of pharmaceutical patents ) , preventing progress , and benefiting concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses , and argue that the public interest is harmed by ever-expansive monopolies in the form of copyright extensions , software patents , and business method patents . More recently scientists and engineers are expressing concern that patent thickets are undermining technological development even in high-tech fields like nanotechnology .
Although the Estonian and Germanic languages are of very different origins , one can identify many similar words in Estonian and German , for example . This is primarily because the Estonian language has borrowed nearly one third of its vocabulary from Germanic languages , mainly from Low Saxon ( Middle Low German ) during the period of German rule , and High German ( including standard German ) . The percentage of Low Saxon and High German loanwords can be estimated at 22–25 percent , with Low Saxon making up about 15 percent .
Some rock formations in the path of a glacier are sculpted into small hills called roche moutonnée , or " sheepback " rock . Roche moutonnée are elongated , rounded , and asymmetrical bedrock knobs that can be produced by glacier erosion . They range in length from less than a meter to several hundred meters long . Roche moutonnée have a gentle slope on their up-glacier sides and a steep to vertical face on their down-glacier sides . The glacier abrades the smooth slope on the upstream side as it flows along , but tears loose and carries away rock from the downstream side via plucking .
Prior to the Reformation , the Polish nobility were mostly either Roman Catholic or Orthodox with a small group of Muslims . Many families , however , soon adopted the Reformed faiths . After the Counter-Reformation , when the Roman Catholic Church regained power in Poland , the nobility became almost exclusively Catholic , despite the fact that Roman Catholicism was not the majority religion in Commonwealth ( the Catholic and Orthodox churches each accounted for some 40 % of all citizens population , with the remaining 20 % being Jews or members of Protestant denominations ) . In the 18th century , many followers of Jacob Frank joined the ranks of Jewish-descended Polish gentry . Although Jewish religion was n't usually a pretext to block or deprive of noble status , some laws favoured religious conversion from Judaism to Christianity ( see : Neophyte ) by rewarding it with ennoblement .
The Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues , established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil , largely in anticipation of the recently constructed Trans-Alaska Pipeline System . The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale , out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale ( which amounted to $ 900 million ) at once . It was later championed by Governor Jay Hammond and Kenai state representative Hugh Malone . It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since , diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund .
As of 2000 [ update ] , there were 67,115 private households in the municipality , and an average of 1.8 persons per household . There were 34,981 households that consist of only one person and 1,592 households with five or more people . In 2000 [ update ] , a total of 65,538 apartments ( 90.6 % of the total ) were permanently occupied , while 5,352 apartments ( 7.4 % ) were seasonally occupied and 1,444 apartments ( 2.0 % ) were empty . As of 2009 [ update ] , the construction rate of new housing units was 1.2 new units per 1000 residents .
New developments in Judaism often transcend differences in religious practice between Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews . In North American cities , social trends such as the chavurah movement , and the emergence of " post-denominational Judaism " often bring together younger Jews of diverse ethnic backgrounds . In recent years , there has been increased interest in Kabbalah , which many Ashkenazi Jews study outside of the Yeshiva framework . Another trend is the new popularity of ecstatic worship in the Jewish Renewal movement and the Carlebach style minyan , both of which are nominally of Ashkenazi origin .
Despite this , the Austrians , under the command of General Laudon , captured Glatz ( now Kłodzko , Poland ) in Silesia . In the Battle of Liegnitz Frederick scored a strong victory despite being outnumbered three to one . The Russians under General Saltykov and Austrians under General Lacy briefly occupied his capital , Berlin , in October , but could not hold it for long . The end of that year saw Frederick once more victorious , defeating the able Daun in the Battle of Torgau ; but he suffered very heavy casualties , and the Austrians retreated in good order .
An intellectual revitalization of Europe started with the birth of medieval universities in the 12th century . The contact with the Islamic world in Spain and Sicily , and during the Reconquista and the Crusades , allowed Europeans access to scientific Greek and Arabic texts , including the works of Aristotle , Ptolemy , Jābir ibn Hayyān , al-Khwarizmi , Alhazen , Avicenna , and Averroes . European scholars had access to the translation programs of Raymond of Toledo , who sponsored the 12th century Toledo School of Translators from Arabic to Latin . Later translators like Michael Scotus would learn Arabic in order to study these texts directly . The European universities aided materially in the translation and propagation of these texts and started a new infrastructure which was needed for scientific communities . In fact , European university put many works about the natural world and the study of nature at the center of its curriculum , with the result that the " medieval university laid far greater emphasis on science than does its modern counterpart and descendent . "
New York City is home to the headquarters of the National Football League , Major League Baseball , the National Basketball Association , the National Hockey League , and Major League Soccer . The New York metropolitan area hosts the most sports teams in these five professional leagues . Participation in professional sports in the city predates all professional leagues , and the city has been continuously hosting professional sports since the birth of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1882 . The city has played host to over forty major professional teams in the five sports and their respective competing leagues , both current and historic . Four of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built worldwide ( MetLife Stadium , the new Yankee Stadium , Madison Square Garden , and Citi Field ) are located in the New York metropolitan area . Madison Square Garden , its predecessor , as well as the original Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field , are some of the most famous sporting venues in the world , the latter two having been commemorated on U.S. postage stamps .
The bipolar junction transistor ( BJT ) was the most commonly used transistor in the 1960s and 70s . Even after MOSFETs became widely available , the BJT remained the transistor of choice for many analog circuits such as amplifiers because of their greater linearity and ease of manufacture . In integrated circuits , the desirable properties of MOSFETs allowed them to capture nearly all market share for digital circuits . Discrete MOSFETs can be applied in transistor applications , including analog circuits , voltage regulators , amplifiers , power transmitters and motor drivers .
Puerto Rico 's constitution expressly forbids capital punishment , stating " The death penalty shall not exist " , setting it apart from all U.S. states and territories other than Michigan , which also has a constitutional prohibition ( eleven other states and the District of Columbia have abolished capital punishment through statutory law ) . However , capital punishment is still applicable to offenses committed in Puerto Rico , if they fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government , though federal death penalty prosecutions there have generated significant controversy .
Gram quantities of various copper salts have been taken in suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans , possibly due to redox cycling and the generation of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA . Corresponding amounts of copper salts ( 30 mg/kg ) are toxic in animals . A minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits has been reported to be at least 3 ppm in the diet . However , higher concentrations of copper ( 100 ppm , 200 ppm , or 500 ppm ) in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed conversion efficiency , growth rates , and carcass dressing percentages .
Victoria 's father was Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn , the fourth son of the reigning King of the United Kingdom , George III . Until 1817 , Edward 's niece , Princess Charlotte of Wales , was the only legitimate grandchild of George III . Her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children . In 1818 he married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld , a widowed German princess with two children—Carl ( 1804–1856 ) and Feodora ( 1807–1872 ) —by her first marriage to the Prince of Leiningen . Her brother Leopold was Princess Charlotte 's widower . The Duke and Duchess of Kent 's only child , Victoria , was born at 4.15 a.m. on 24 May 1819 at Kensington Palace in London .
Norfolk Island Hospital is the only medical centre on the island . Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme do not cover Norfolk Island . All visitors to Norfolk Island , including Australians , are recommended to purchase travel insurance . Although the hospital can perform minor surgery , serious medical conditions are not permitted to be treated on the island and patients are flown back to mainland Australia . Air charter transport can cost in the order of A $ 30,000 . For serious emergencies , medical evacuations are provided by the Royal Australian Air Force . The island has one ambulance staffed by St John Ambulance Australia volunteers .
There are many missionary groups operating in the country , including Lutherans , Baptists , Catholics , Grace Brethren , and Jehovah 's Witnesses . While these missionaries are predominantly from the United States , France , Italy , and Spain , many are also from Nigeria , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and other African countries . Large numbers of missionaries left the country when fighting broke out between rebel and government forces in 2002–3 , but many of them have now returned to continue their work .
According to Johnson and Grim ( 2013 ) , Buddhism has grown from a total of 138 million adherents in 1910 , of which 137 million were in Asia , to 495 million in 2010 , of which 487 million are in Asia . According to them , there was a fast annual growth of Buddhism in Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Lebanon and several Western European countries ( 1910–2010 ) . More recently ( 2000–2010 ) , the countries with highest growth rates are Qatar , the United Arab Emirates , Iran and some African countries .
The term Cubism did not come into general usage until 1911 , mainly with reference to Metzinger , Gleizes , Delaunay , and Léger . In 1911 , the poet and critic Guillaume Apollinaire accepted the term on behalf of a group of artists invited to exhibit at the Brussels Indépendants . The following year , in preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or , Metzinger and Gleizes wrote and published Du " Cubisme " in an effort to dispel the confusion raging around the word , and as a major defence of Cubism ( which had caused a public scandal following the 1911 Salon des Indépendants and the 1912 Salon d'Automne in Paris ) . Clarifying their aims as artists , this work was the first theoretical treatise on Cubism and it still remains the clearest and most intelligible . The result , not solely a collaboration between its two authors , reflected discussions by the circle of artists who met in Puteaux and Courbevoie . It mirrored the attitudes of the " artists of Passy " , which included Picabia and the Duchamp brothers , to whom sections of it were read prior to publication . The concept developed in Du " Cubisme " of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously , i.e. , the act of moving around an object to seize it from several successive angles fused into a single image ( multiple viewpoints , mobile perspective , simultaneity or multiplicity ) , is a generally recognized device used by the Cubists .
Endemic species can be threatened with extinction through the process of genetic pollution , i.e . uncontrolled hybridization , introgression and genetic swamping . Genetic pollution leads to homogenization or replacement of local genomes as a result of either a numerical and/or fitness advantage of an introduced species . Hybridization and introgression are side-effects of introduction and invasion . These phenomena can be especially detrimental to rare species that come into contact with more abundant ones . The abundant species can interbreed with the rare species , swamping its gene pool . This problem is not always apparent from morphological ( outward appearance ) observations alone . Some degree of gene flow is normal adaptation , and not all gene and genotype constellations can be preserved . However , hybridization with or without introgression may , nevertheless , threaten a rare species ' existence .
The function of Apollo as a " healer " is connected with Paean ( Παιών-Παιήων ) , the physician of the Gods in the Iliad , who seems to come from a more primitive religion . Paeοn is probably connected with the Mycenean pa-ja-wo-ne ( Linear B : 𐀞𐀊𐀍𐀚 ) , but this is not certain . He did not have a separate cult , but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease . Later the Greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song " paean " ( παιάν ) . The magicians were also called " seer-doctors " ( ἰατρομάντεις ) , and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god Apollo at the oracles .
Radio St Helena , which started operations on Christmas Day 1967 , provided a local radio service that had a range of about 100 km ( 62 mi ) from the island , and also broadcast internationally on shortwave radio ( 11092.5 kHz ) on one day a year . The station presented news , features and music in collaboration with its sister newspaper , the St Helena Herald . It closed on 25 December 2012 to make way for a new three-channel FM service , also funded by St. Helena Government and run by the South Atlantic Media Services ( formerly St. Helena Broadcasting ( Guarantee ) Corporation ) .
One of the oldest cities in the United States , Boston was founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from England . It was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution , such as the Boston Massacre , the Boston Tea Party , the Battle of Bunker Hill , and the Siege of Boston . Upon American independence from Great Britain , the city continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub , as well as a center for education and culture . Through land reclamation and municipal annexation , Boston has expanded beyond the original peninsula . Its rich history attracts many tourists , with Faneuil Hall alone drawing over 20 million visitors per year . Boston 's many firsts include the United States ' first public school , Boston Latin School ( 1635 ) , and first subway system ( 1897 ) .
In 1846 , the United States went to war against Mexico and sent a naval and land expedition to conquer Alta California . At first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports including San Diego , but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back . Following the successful revolt in Los Angeles , the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846 . Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24 , 1846 , when the Americans recaptured it . For the next several months the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo . Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night . The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out . On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General Stephen W. Kearney were at Warner 's Ranch . Commodore Robert F. Stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain Archibald Gillespie to march north to meet him . Their joint command of 150 men , returning to San Diego , encountered about 93 Californios under Andrés Pico . In the ensuing Battle of San Pasqual , fought in the San Pasqual Valley which is now part of the city of San Diego , the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign . Subsequently a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego , rescuing Kearny 's battered and blockaded command .
Many different disciplines have produced work on the emotions . Human sciences study the role of emotions in mental processes , disorders , and neural mechanisms . In psychiatry , emotions are examined as part of the discipline 's study and treatment of mental disorders in humans . Nursing studies emotions as part of its approach to the provision of holistic health care to humans . Psychology examines emotions from a scientific perspective by treating them as mental processes and behavior and they explore the underlying physiological and neurological processes . In neuroscience sub-fields such as social neuroscience and affective neuroscience , scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotion by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality , emotion , and mood . In linguistics , the expression of emotion may change to the meaning of sounds . In education , the role of emotions in relation to learning is examined .
BYU 's stated mission " is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life . " BYU is thus considered by its leaders to be at heart a religious institution , wherein , ideally , religious and secular education are interwoven in a way that encourages the highest standards in both areas . This weaving of the secular and the religious aspects of a religious university goes back as far as Brigham Young himself , who told Karl G. Maeser when the Church purchased the school : " I want you to remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God . "
Despite these criticisms , Comcast has appeared on multiple " top places to work " lists . In 2009 , it was included on CableFAX magazine 's " Top 10 Places to Work in Cable " , which cited its " scale , savvy and vision " . Similarly , the Philadelphia Business Journal awarded Comcast the silver medal among extra-large companies in Philadelphia , with the gold medal going to partner organization , Comcast-Spectacor . The Boston Globe found Comcast to be that city 's top place to work in 2009 . Employee diversity is also an attribute upon which Comcast receives strong marks . In 2008 , Black Enterprise magazine rated Comcast among the top 15 companies for workforce diversity . Comcast was also named a " Top 2014 Workplace " by the Washington Post in their annual feature .
Broadly speaking , Daylight Saving Time was abandoned in the years after the war ( with some notable exceptions including Canada , the UK , France , and Ireland for example ) . However , it was brought back for periods of time in many different places during the following decades , and commonly during the Second World War . It became widely adopted , particularly in North America and Europe starting in the 1970s as a result of the 1970s energy crisis .
The government broadened land ownership by returning land that had been sold to large landowners in the late Ming period by families unable to pay the land tax . To give people more incentives to participate in the market , they reduced the tax burden in comparison with the late Ming , and replaced the corvée system with a head tax used to hire laborers . The administration of the Grand Canal was made more efficient , and transport opened to private merchants . A system of monitoring grain prices eliminated severe shortages , and enabled the price of rice to rise slowly and smoothly through the 18th century . Wary of the power of wealthy merchants , Qing rulers limited their trading licenses and usually refused them permission to open new mines , except in poor areas . These restrictions on domestic resource exploration , as well as on foreign trade , are held by some scholars as a cause of the Great Divergence , by which the Western world overtook China economically .
It is thought that annelids were originally animals with two separate sexes , which released ova and sperm into the water via their nephridia . The fertilized eggs develop into trochophore larvae , which live as plankton . Later they sink to the sea-floor and metamorphose into miniature adults : the part of the trochophore between the apical tuft and the prototroch becomes the prostomium ( head ) ; a small area round the trochophore 's anus becomes the pygidium ( tail-piece ) ; a narrow band immediately in front of that becomes the growth zone that produces new segments ; and the rest of the trochophore becomes the peristomium ( the segment that contains the mouth ) .
With the rise of disco in the US and punk rock in the UK , hard rock 's mainstream dominance was rivalled toward the later part of the decade . Disco appealed to a more diverse group of people and punk seemed to take over the rebellious role that hard rock once held . Early punk bands like The Ramones explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock , with almost all of their songs clocking in around two minutes with no guitar solos . However , new rock acts continued to emerge and record sales remained high into the 1980s . 1977 saw the début and rise to stardom of Foreigner , who went on to release several platinum albums through to the mid-1980s . Midwestern groups like Kansas , REO Speedwagon and Styx helped further cement heavy rock in the Midwest as a form of stadium rock . In 1978 , Van Halen emerged from the Los Angeles music scene with a sound based around the skills of lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen . He popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping , showcased on the song " Eruption " from the album Van Halen , which was highly influential in re-establishing hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion , while also redefining and elevating the role of electric guitar .
During the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony and only six weeks before the wedding of Charles , Prince of Wales , and Lady Diana Spencer , six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down The Mall on her horse , Burmese . Police later discovered that the shots were blanks . The 17-year-old assailant , Marcus Sarjeant , was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three . The Queen 's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised . From April to September 1982 , the Queen remained anxious but proud of her son , Prince Andrew , who was serving with British forces during the Falklands War . On 9 July , the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder , Michael Fagan , in the room with her . Remaining calm and through two calls to the Palace police switchboard , she spoke to Fagan while he sat at the foot of her bed until assistance arrived seven minutes later . Though she hosted US President Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visited his Californian ranch in 1983 , she was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada , one of her Caribbean realms , without informing her .
By 1790 , the Jewish population of Alsace was approximately 22,500 , about 3 % of the provincial population . They were highly segregated and subject to long-standing anti-Jewish regulations . They maintained their own customs , Yiddish language , and historic traditions within the tightly-knit ghettos ; they adhered to Talmudic law enforced by their rabbis . Jews were barred from most cities and instead lived in villages . They concentrated in trade , services , and especially in money lending . They financed about a third of the mortgages in Alsace . Official tolerance grew during the French Revolution , with full emancipation in 1791 . However , local antisemitism also increased and Napoleon turned hostile in 1806 , imposing a one-year moratorium on all debts owed to Jews . [ citation needed ] In the 1830-1870 era most Jews moved to the cities , where they integrated and acculturated , as antisemitism sharply declined . By 1831 , the state began paying salaries to official rabbis , and in 1846 a special legal oath for Jews was discontinued . Antisemitic local riots occasionally occurred , especially during the Revolution of 1848 . Merger of Alsace into Germany in 1871-1918 lessened antisemitic violence .
As for Mac OS , System 7 was a 32-bit rewrite from Pascal to C++ that introduced virtual memory and improved the handling of color graphics , as well as memory addressing , networking , and co-operative multitasking . Also during this time , the Macintosh began to shed the " Snow White " design language , along with the expensive consulting fees they were paying to Frogdesign . Apple instead brought the design work in-house by establishing the Apple Industrial Design Group , becoming responsible for crafting a new look for all Apple products .
About the creation-evolution controversy , Popper wrote that he considered it " a somewhat sensational clash between a brilliant scientific hypothesis concerning the history of the various species of animals and plants on earth , and an older metaphysical theory which , incidentally , happened to be part of an established religious belief " with a footnote to the effect that " [ he ] agree [ s ] with Professor C.E . Raven when , in his Science , Religion , and the Future , 1943 , he calls this conflict " a storm in a Victorian tea-cup " ; though the force of this remark is perhaps a little impaired by the attention he pays to the vapours still emerging from the cup—to the Great Systems of Evolutionist Philosophy , produced by Bergson , Whitehead , Smuts , and others . "
All iPods except for the iPod Touch can function in " disk mode " as mass storage devices to store data files but this may not be the default behavior , and in the case of the iPod Touch , requires special software . [ citation needed ] If an iPod is formatted on a Mac OS computer , it uses the HFS+ file system format , which allows it to serve as a boot disk for a Mac computer . If it is formatted on Windows , the FAT32 format is used . With the release of the Windows-compatible iPod , the default file system used on the iPod line switched from HFS+ to FAT32 , although it can be reformatted to either file system ( excluding the iPod Shuffle which is strictly FAT32 ) . Generally , if a new iPod ( excluding the iPod Shuffle ) is initially plugged into a computer running Windows , it will be formatted with FAT32 , and if initially plugged into a Mac running Mac OS it will be formatted with HFS+ .
During the Middle Ages , shipbuilding became an important industry for the town . Henry V 's famous warship HMS Grace Dieu was built in Southampton . Walter Taylor 's 18th century mechanisation of the block-making process was a significant step in the Industrial Revolution . From 1904 to 2004 , the Thornycroft shipbuilding yard was a major employer in Southampton , building and repairing ships used in the two World Wars .
In addition to membership , as of 2010 [ update ] there are 1,335 officially registered fan clubs , called penyes , around the world . The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona . Among the best supported teams globally , Barcelona has the highest social media following in the world among sports teams , with over 90 million Facebook fans as of February 2016 . The club has had many prominent people among its supporters , including Pope John Paul II , who was an honorary member , and former prime minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero . FC Barcelona has the second highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund .
All signatories to the CPPCG are required to prevent and punish acts of genocide , both in peace and wartime , though some barriers make this enforcement difficult . In particular , some of the signatories—namely , Bahrain , Bangladesh , India , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , the United States , Vietnam , Yemen , and former Yugoslavia—signed with the proviso that no claim of genocide could be brought against them at the International Court of Justice without their consent . Despite official protests from other signatories ( notably Cyprus and Norway ) on the ethics and legal standing of these reservations , the immunity from prosecution they grant has been invoked from time to time , as when the United States refused to allow a charge of genocide brought against it by former Yugoslavia following the 1999 Kosovo War .
Athanasius also wrote a two-part Against the Heathen and The Incarnation of the Word of God . Completed probably early in his life , before the Arian controversy , they constitute the first classic work of developed Orthodox theology . In the first part , Athanasius attacks several pagan practices and beliefs . The second part presents teachings on the redemption . Also in these books , Athanasius put forward the belief that the Son of God , the eternal Word through whom God created the world , entered that world in human form to lead men back into the harmony from which they had earlier fallen away .
Ruben Studdard emerged as the winner , beating Clay Aiken by a small margin . Out of a total of 24 million votes , Studdard finished just 134,000 votes ahead of Aiken . This slim margin of victory was controversial due to the large number of calls that failed to get through . In an interview prior to season five , executive producer Nigel Lythgoe indicated that Aiken had led the fan voting from the wildcard week onward until the finale .
Polytechnic schools are distinct from academic universities in Finland . Ammattikorkeakoulu is the common term in Finland , as is the Swedish alternative " yrkeshögskola " – their focus is on studies leading to a degree ( for instance insinööri , engineer ; in international use , Bachelor of Engineering ) in kind different from but in level comparable to an academic bachelor 's degree awarded by a university . Since 2006 the polytechnics have offered studies leading to master 's degrees ( Master of Engineering ) . After January 1 , 2006 , some Finnish ammattikorkeakoulus switched the English term " polytechnic " to the term " university of applied sciences " in the English translations of their legal names . The ammattikorkeakoulu has many similarities to the hogeschool in Belgium and in the Netherlands and to the Fachhochschule in the German language areas .
Although dissertations on clothing and its function appear from the 19th century as colonising countries dealt with new environments , concerted scientific research into psycho-social , physiological and other functions of clothing ( e.g . protective , cartage ) occurred in the first half of the 20th century , with publications such as J. C. Flügel 's Psychology of Clothes in 1930 , and Newburgh 's seminal Physiology of Heat Regulation and The Science of Clothing in 1949 . By 1968 , the field of environmental physiology had advanced and expanded significantly , but the science of clothing in relation to environmental physiology had changed little . While considerable research has since occurred and the knowledge-base has grown significantly , the main concepts remain unchanged , and indeed Newburgh 's book is still cited by contemporary authors , including those attempting to develop thermoregulatory models of clothing development .
Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools : the original undergraduate college , the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences , and twelve professional schools . While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation , each school 's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs . In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven , the University owns athletic facilities in western New Haven , including the Yale Bowl , a campus in West Haven , Connecticut , and forest and nature preserves throughout New England . The university 's assets include an endowment valued at $ 25.6 billion as of September 2015 , the second largest of any educational institution.The Yale University Library , serving all constituent schools , holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States .
Gaddafi sought to develop closer links in the Maghreb ; in January 1974 Libya and Tunisia announced a political union , the Arab Islamic Republic . Although advocated by Gaddafi and Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba , the move was deeply unpopular in Tunisia and soon abandoned . Retaliating , Gaddafi sponsored anti-government militants in Tunisia into the 1980s . Turning his attention to Algeria , in 1975 Libya signed the Hassi Messaoud defence agreement allegedly to counter " Moroccan expansionism " , also funding the Polisario Front of Western Sahara in their independence struggle against Morocco . Seeking to diversify Libya 's economy , Gaddafi 's government began purchasing shares in major European corporations like Fiat as well as buying real estate in Malta and Italy , which would become a valuable source of income during the 1980s oil slump .
According to a report published in 2014 , about 43 % of all Jews reside in Israel ( 6.1 million ) , and 40 % in the United States ( 5.7 million ) , with most of the remainder living in Europe ( 1.4 million ) and Canada ( 0.4 million ) . These numbers include all those who self-identified as Jews in a socio-demographic study or were identified as such by a respondent in the same household . The exact world Jewish population , however , is difficult to measure . In addition to issues with census methodology , disputes among proponents of halakhic , secular , political , and ancestral identification factors regarding who is a Jew may affect the figure considerably depending on the source .
Tsai writes that shortly after the visit by Deshin Shekpa , the Yongle Emperor ordered the construction of a road and of trading posts in the upper reaches of the Yangzi and Mekong Rivers in order to facilitate trade with Tibet in tea , horses , and salt . The trade route passed through Sichuan and crossed Shangri-La County in Yunnan . Wang and Nyima assert that this " tribute-related trade " of the Ming exchanging Chinese tea for Tibetan horses—while granting Tibetan envoys and Tibetan merchants explicit permission to trade with Han Chinese merchants— " furthered the rule of the Ming dynasty court over Tibet " . Rossabi and Sperling note that this trade in Tibetan horses for Chinese tea existed long before the Ming . Peter C. Perdue says that Wang Anshi ( 1021–1086 ) , realizing that China could not produce enough militarily capable steeds , had also aimed to obtain horses from Inner Asia in exchange for Chinese tea . The Chinese needed horses not only for cavalry but also as draft animals for the army 's supply wagons . The Tibetans required Chinese tea not only as a common beverage but also as a religious ceremonial supplement . The Ming government imposed a monopoly on tea production and attempted to regulate this trade with state-supervised markets , but these collapsed in 1449 due to military failures and internal ecological and commercial pressures on the tea-producing regions .
Near New Haven there is the static inverter plant of the HVDC Cross Sound Cable . There are three PureCell Model 400 fuel cells placed in the city of New Haven—one at the New Haven Public Schools and newly constructed Roberto Clemente School , one at the mixed-use 360 State Street building , and one at City Hall . According to Giovanni Zinn of the city 's Office of Sustainability , each fuel cell may save the city up to $ 1 million in energy costs over a decade . The fuel cells were provided by ClearEdge Power , formerly UTC Power .
The translator 's role as a bridge for " carrying across " values between cultures has been discussed at least since Terence , the 2nd-century-BCE Roman adapter of Greek comedies . The translator 's role is , however , by no means a passive , mechanical one , and so has also been compared to that of an artist . The main ground seems to be the concept of parallel creation found in critics such as Cicero . Dryden observed that " Translation is a type of drawing after life ... " Comparison of the translator with a musician or actor goes back at least to Samuel Johnson’s remark about Alexander Pope playing Homer on a flageolet , while Homer himself used a bassoon .
Colonial Lowcountry landowners experimented with cash crops ranging from tea to silkworms . African slaves brought knowledge of rice cultivation , which plantation owners cultivated and developed as a successful commodity crop by 1700 . With the coerced help of African slaves from the Caribbean , Eliza Lucas , daughter of plantation owner George Lucas , learned how to raise and use indigo in the Lowcountry in 1747 . Supported with subsidies from Britain , indigo was a leading export by 1750 . Those and naval stores were exported in an extremely profitable shipping industry .
Qutb Shahi architecture of the 16th and early 17th centuries followed classical Persian architecture featuring domes and colossal arches . The oldest surviving Qutb Shahi structure in Hyderabad is the ruins of Golconda fort built in the 16th century . The Charminar , Mecca Masjid , Charkaman and Qutb Shahi tombs are other existing structures of this period . Among these the Charminar has become an icon of the city ; located in the centre of old Hyderabad , it is a square structure with sides 20 m ( 66 ft ) long and four grand arches each facing a road . At each corner stands a 56 m ( 184 ft ) -high minaret . Most of the historical bazaars that still exist were constructed on the street north of Charminar towards Golconda fort . The Charminar , Qutb Shahi tombs and Golconda fort are considered to be monuments of national importance in India ; in 2010 the Indian government proposed that the sites be listed for UNESCO World Heritage status . :11–18
In 2004 , NIST researchers presented evidence that an isotropic non-crystalline metallic phase ( dubbed " q-glass " ) could be grown from the melt . This phase is the first phase , or " primary phase , " to form in the Al-Fe-Si system during rapid cooling . Interestingly , experimental evidence indicates that this phase forms by a first-order transition . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) images show that the q-glass nucleates from the melt as discrete particles , which grow spherically with a uniform growth rate in all directions . The diffraction pattern shows it to be an isotropic glassy phase . Yet there is a nucleation barrier , which implies an interfacial discontinuity ( or internal surface ) between the glass and the melt .
Incubation , which optimises temperature for chick development , usually begins after the last egg has been laid . In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared , whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation . Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches , areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds . Incubation can be an energetically demanding process ; adult albatrosses , for instance , lose as much as 83 grams ( 2.9 oz ) of body weight per day of incubation . The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun , decaying vegetation or volcanic sources . Incubation periods range from 10 days ( in woodpeckers , cuckoos and passerine birds ) to over 80 days ( in albatrosses and kiwis ) .
However , there is significant disagreement within Orthodox Judaism , particularly between Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism , about the extent and circumstances under which the proper application of Halakha should be re-examined as a result of changing realities . As a general rule , Haredi Jews believe that when at all possible the law should be maintained as it was understood by their authorities at the haskalah , believing that it had never changed . Modern Orthodox authorities are more willing to assume that under scrupulous examination , identical principles may lead to different applications in the context of modern life . To the Orthodox Jew , halakha is a guide , God 's Law , governing the structure of daily life from the moment he or she wakes up to the moment he goes to sleep . It includes codes of behaviour applicable to a broad range of circumstances ( and many hypothetical ones ) . There are though a number of halakhic meta-principles that guide the halakhic process and in an instance of opposition between a specific halakha and a meta-principle , the meta-principle often wins out . Examples of Halakhic Meta-Principles are : " Deracheha Darchei Noam " - the ways of Torah are pleasant , " Kavod Habriyot " - basic respect for human beings , " Pikuach Nefesh " - the sanctity of human life .
A brash boosterism that had typified Melbourne during this time ended in the early 1890s with a severe depression of the city 's economy , sending the local finance and property industries into a period of chaos during which 16 small " land banks " and building societies collapsed , and 133 limited companies went into liquidation . The Melbourne financial crisis was a contributing factor in the Australian economic depression of the 1890s and the Australian banking crisis of 1893 . The effects of the depression on the city were profound , with virtually no new construction until the late 1890s .
Comcast delivers third-party television programming content to its own customers , and also produces its own first-party content both for subscribers and customers of other competing television services . Fully or partially owned Comcast programming includes Comcast Newsmakers , Comcast Network , Comcast SportsNet , SportsNet New York , MLB Network , Comcast Sports Southeast/Charter Sports Southeast , NBC Sports Network , The Golf Channel , AZN Television , and FEARnet . On May 19 , 2009 , Disney and ESPN announced an agreement to allow Comcast Corporation to carry the channels ESPNU and ESPN3 . The U.S. Olympic Committee and Comcast intended to team up to create The U.S. Olympic Network , which was slated to launch after the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games . These plans were then put on hold by the U.S. Olympic Committee . The U.S. Olympic Committee and Comcast have ended the plans to create The U.S. Olympic Network .
Somalia established its first ISP in 1999 , one of the last countries in Africa to get connected to the Internet . According to the telecommunications resource Balancing Act , growth in internet connectivity has since then grown considerably , with around 53 % of the entire nation covered as of 2009 . Both internet commerce and telephony have consequently become among the quickest growing local businesses .
When it comes to civil and criminal cases , the Bundesgerichtshof is at the top of the hierarchy of courts . The other branches of the German judicial system each have their own appellate systems , each topped by a high court ; these are the Bundessozialgericht for matters of social security , the Bundesarbeitsgericht for employment and labour , the Bundesfinanzhof for taxation and financial issues , and the Bundesverwaltungsgericht for administrative law . The so-called Gemeinsamer Senat der Obersten Gerichtshöfe ( Joint Senate of the Supreme Courts ) is not a supreme court in itself , but an ad-hoc body that is convened in only when one supreme court intends to diverge from another supreme court 's legal opinion or when a certain case exceeds the authority of one court . As the courts have well-defined areas of responsibility , situations like these are rather rare and so , the Joint Senate gathers very infrequently , and only to consider matters which are mostly definitory .
Genetic studies of mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) of Amerindians and some Siberian and Central Asian peoples also revealed that the gene pool of the Turkic-speaking peoples of Siberia such as Altaians , Khakas , Shors and Soyots , living between the Altai and Lake Baikal along the Sayan mountains , are genetically closest to Amerindians . [ citation needed ] This view is shared by other researchers who argue that " the ancestors of the American Indians were the first to separate from the great Asian population in the Middle Paleolithic . 2012 research found evidence for a recent common ancestry between Native Americans and indigenous Altaians based on mitochondrial DNA and Y-Chromosome analysis . The paternal lineages of Altaians mostly belong to the subclades of haplogroup P-M45 ( xR1a 38-93 % ; xQ1a 4-32 % ) .
In the 1960s , American and British blues and rock bands began to modify rock and roll by adding harder sounds , heavier guitar riffs , bombastic drumming , and louder vocals , from electric blues . Early forms of hard rock can be heard in the work of Chicago blues musicians Elmore James , Muddy Waters , and Howlin ' Wolf , The Kingsmen 's version of " Louie Louie " ( 1963 ) which made it a garage rock standard , and the songs of rhythm and blues influenced British Invasion acts , including " You Really Got Me " by The Kinks ( 1964 ) , " My Generation " by The Who ( 1965 ) , " Shapes of Things " ( 1966 ) by The Yardbirds and " ( I Ca n't Get No ) Satisfaction " ( 1965 ) by The Rolling Stones . From the late 1960s , it became common to divide mainstream rock music that emerged from psychedelia into soft and hard rock . Soft rock was often derived from folk rock , using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies . In contrast , hard rock was most often derived from blues rock and was played louder and with more intensity .
On August 31 , 1886 , Charleston was nearly destroyed by an earthquake . The shock was estimated to have a moment magnitude of 7.0 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X ( Extreme ) . It was felt as far away as Boston to the north , Chicago and Milwaukee to the northwest , as far west as New Orleans , as far south as Cuba , and as far east as Bermuda . It damaged 2,000 buildings in Charleston and caused $ 6 million worth of damage ( $ 133 million in 2006 dollars ) , at a time when all the city 's buildings were valued around $ 24 million ( $ 531 million in 2006 dollars ) .
Elimination of Polish elites and intelligentia was part of Generalplan Ost . The Intelligenzaktion , a plan to eliminate the Polish intelligentsia , Poland 's 'leadership class ' , took place soon after the German invasion of Poland , lasting from fall of 1939 till spring of 1940 . As the result of this operation in 10 regional actions about 60,000 Polish nobles , teachers , social workers , priests , judges and political activists were killed . It was continued in May 1940 when Germany launched AB-Aktion , More than 16,000 members of the intelligentsia were murdered in Operation Tannenberg alone .
Although spoken Tibetan varies according to the region , the written language , based on Classical Tibetan , is consistent throughout . This is probably due to the long-standing influence of the Tibetan empire , whose rule embraced ( and extended at times far beyond ) the present Tibetan linguistic area , which runs from northern Pakistan in the west to Yunnan and Sichuan in the east , and from north of Qinghai Lake south as far as Bhutan . The Tibetan language has its own script which it shares with Ladakhi and Dzongkha , and which is derived from the ancient Indian Brāhmī script .
At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2015 , Beyoncé was nominated for six awards , ultimately winning three : Best R & B Performance and Best R & B Song for " Drunk in Love " , and Best Surround Sound Album for Beyoncé . She was nominated for Album of the Year but the award was won by Beck for his Morning Phase album . In August , the cover of the September issue of Vogue magazine was unveiled online , Beyoncé as the cover star , becoming the first African-American artist and third African-American woman in general to cover the September issue . She headlined the 2015 Made in America festival in early September and also the Global Citizen Festival later that month . Beyoncé made an uncredited featured appearance on the track " Hymn for the Weekend " by British rock band Coldplay , on their seventh studio album A Head Full of Dreams ( 2015 ) , which saw release in December . On January 7 , 2016 , Pepsi announced Beyoncé would perform alongside Coldplay at Super Bowl 50 in February . Knowles has previously performed at four Super Bowl shows throughout her career , serving as the main headliner of the 47th Super Bowl halftime show in 2013 .
Popular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of Mary 's conception . In 1439 , the Council of Basel , which is not reckoned an ecumenical council , stated that belief in the immaculate conception of Mary is in accord with the Catholic faith . By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties , but such was the influence of the Dominicans , and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas ( who had been canonised in 1323 and declared " Doctor Angelicus " of the Church in 1567 ) that the Council of Trent ( 1545–63 ) —which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine—instead declined to take a position .
To improve the efficiency of the lamp , the filament usually consists of multiple coils of coiled fine wire , also known as a 'coiled coil ' . For a 60-watt 120-volt lamp , the uncoiled length of the tungsten filament is usually 22.8 inches ( 580 mm ) , and the filament diameter is 0.0018 inches ( 0.046 mm ) . The advantage of the coiled coil is that evaporation of the tungsten filament is at the rate of a tungsten cylinder having a diameter equal to that of the coiled coil . The coiled-coil filament evaporates more slowly than a straight filament of the same surface area and light-emitting power . As a result , the filament can then run hotter , which results in a more efficient light source , while reducing the evaporation so that the filament will last longer than a straight filament at the same temperature .
Palmerston died in 1865 , and after a brief ministry led by Russell , Derby returned to power . In 1866 , Victoria attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time since Albert 's death . The following year she supported the passing of the Reform Act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men , though she was not in favour of votes for women . Derby resigned in 1868 , to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli , who charmed Victoria . " Everyone likes flattery , " he said , " and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel . " With the phrase " we authors , Ma'am " , he complimented her . Disraeli 's ministry only lasted a matter of months , and at the end of the year his Liberal rival , William Ewart Gladstone , was appointed prime minister . Victoria found Gladstone 's demeanour far less appealing ; he spoke to her , she is thought to have complained , as though she were " a public meeting rather than a woman " .
Of the approximately 850 municipalities of Thuringia , 126 are classed as towns ( within a district ) or cities ( forming their own urban district ) . Most of the towns are small with a population of less than 10,000 ; only the ten biggest ones have a population greater than 30,000 . The first towns emerged during the 12th century , whereas the latest ones received town status only in the 20th century . Today , all municipalities within districts are equal in law , whether they are towns or villages . Independent cities ( i.e . urban districts ) have greater powers ( the same as any district ) than towns within a district .
There are several theories to the Islamisation process in Southeast Asia . Another theory is trade . The expansion of trade among West Asia , India and Southeast Asia helped the spread of the religion as Muslim traders from Southern Yemen ( Hadramout ) brought Islam to the region with their large volume of trade . Many settled in Indonesia , Singapore , and Malaysia . This is evident in the Arab-Indonesian , Arab-Singaporean , and Arab-Malay populations who were at one time very prominent in each of their countries . The second theory is the role of missionaries or Sufis . [ citation needed ] The Sufi missionaries played a significant role in spreading the faith by introducing Islamic ideas to the region . Finally , the ruling classes embraced Islam and that further aided the permeation of the religion throughout the region . The ruler of the region 's most important port , Malacca Sultanate , embraced Islam in the 15th century , heralding a period of accelerated conversion of Islam throughout the region as Islam provided a positive force among the ruling and trading classes .
Trade secret misappropriation is different from violations of other intellectual property laws , since by definition trade secrets are secret , while patents and registered copyrights and trademarks are publicly available . In the United States , trade secrets are protected under state law , and states have nearly universally adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act . The United States also has federal law in the form of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 ( 18 U.S.C . §§ 1831–1839 ) , which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime . This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity . The first , 18 U.S.C . § 1831 ( a ) , criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers . The second , 18 U.S.C . § 1832 , criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes . ( The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses . ) In Commonwealth common law jurisdictions , confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an equitable right rather than a property right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as the United States .

Yale traces its beginnings to " An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School , " passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut on October 9 , 1701 , while meeting in New Haven . The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut . Soon thereafter , a group of ten Congregationalist ministers : Samuel Andrew , Thomas Buckingham , Israel Chauncy , Samuel Mather , Rev . James Noyes II ( son of James Noyes ) , James Pierpont , Abraham Pierson , Noadiah Russell , Joseph Webb and Timothy Woodbridge , all alumni of Harvard , met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell in Branford , Connecticut , to pool their books to form the school 's library . The group , led by James Pierpont , is now known as " The Founders " . [ citation needed ]
Yale expanded gradually , establishing the Yale School of Medicine ( 1810 ) , Yale Divinity School ( 1822 ) , Yale Law School ( 1843 ) , Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences ( 1847 ) , the Sheffield Scientific School ( 1847 ) , and the Yale School of Fine Arts ( 1869 ) . In 1887 , as the college continued to grow under the presidency of Timothy Dwight V , Yale College was renamed Yale University . The university would later add the Yale School of Music ( 1894 ) , the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies ( founded by Gifford Pinchot in 1900 ) , the Yale School of Public Health ( 1915 ) , the Yale School of Nursing ( 1923 ) , the Yale School of Drama ( 1955 ) , the Yale Physician Associate Program ( 1973 ) , and the Yale School of Management ( 1976 ) . It would also reorganize its relationship with the Sheffield Scientific School .
Genre fiction also showed it could question reality in its 20th century forms , in spite of its fixed formulas , through the enquiries of the skeptical detective and the alternative realities of science fiction . The separation of " mainstream " and " genre " forms ( including journalism ) continued to blur during the period up to our own times . William Burroughs , in his early works , and Hunter S. Thompson expanded documentary reporting into strong subjective statements after the second World War , and post-modern critics have disparaged the idea of objective realism in general .
Sacerdotalis caelibatus ( Latin for " Of the celibate priesthood " ) , promulgated on 24 June 1967 , defends the Catholic Church 's tradition of priestly celibacy in the West . This encyclical was written in the wake of Vatican II , when the Catholic Church was questioning and revising many long-held practices . Priestly celibacy is considered a discipline rather than dogma , and some had expected that it might be relaxed . In response to these questions , the Pope reaffirms the discipline as a long-held practice with special importance in the Catholic Church . The encyclical Sacerdotalis caelibatus from 24 June 1967 , confirms the traditional Church teaching , that celibacy is an ideal state and continues to be mandatory for Roman Catholic priests . Celibacy symbolizes the reality of the kingdom of God amid modern society . The priestly celibacy is closely linked to the sacramental priesthood . However , during his pontificate Paul VI was considered generous in permitting bishops to grant laicization of priests who wanted to leave the sacerdotal state , a position which was drastically reversed by John Paul II in 1980 and cemented in the 1983 Canon Law that only the pope can in exceptional circumstances grant laicization .
The bel ( B ) and the smaller decibel ( dB ) are units of measurement of sound intensity invented by Bell Labs and named after him . [ N 28 ] Since 1976 the IEEE 's Alexander Graham Bell Medal has been awarded to honor outstanding contributions in the field of telecommunications .
Spielberg 's next film , Schindler 's List , was based on the true story of Oskar Schindler , a man who risked his life to save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust . Schindler 's List earned Spielberg his first Academy Award for Best Director ( it also won Best Picture ) . With the film a huge success at the box office , Spielberg used the profits to set up the Shoah Foundation , a non-profit organization that archives filmed testimony of Holocaust survivors . In 1997 , the American Film Institute listed it among the 10 Greatest American Films ever Made ( # 9 ) which moved up to ( # 8 ) when the list was remade in 2007 .
The state has one city with a population exceeding one million : Ciudad Juárez . Ciudad Juárez is ranked eighth most populous city in the country and Chihuahua City was ranked 16th most populous in Mexico . Chihuahua ( along with Baja California ) is the only state in Mexico to have two cities ranked in the top 20 most populated . El Paso and Ciudad Juárez comprise one of the largest binational metropolitan areas in the world with a combined population of 2.4 million . In fact , Ciudad Juárez is one of the fastest growing cities in the world in spite of the fact that it is " the most violent zone in the world outside of declared war zones " . For instance , a few years ago the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas published that in Ciudad Juárez " the average annual growth over the 10-year period 1990–2000 was 5.3 percent . Juárez experienced much higher population growth than the state of Chihuahua and than Mexico as a whole " . Chihuahua City has one of the highest literacy rates in the country at 98 % ; 35 % of the population is aged 14 or below , 60 % 15-65 , and 5 % over 65 . The growth rate is 2.4 % . The 76.5 % of the population of the state of Chihuahua live in cities which makes the state one of the most urbanized in Mexico .
In 2013 , the league expanded with the addition of two new franchises to play in 2014 , the Los Angeles Kiss ( owned by Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley of the legendary rock band Kiss ) and the Portland Thunder .
The GameCube and Wii versions feature several minor differences in their controls . The Wii version of the game makes use of the motion sensors and built-in speaker of the Wii Remote . The speaker emits the sounds of a bowstring when shooting an arrow , Midna 's laugh when she gives advice to Link , and the series ' trademark " chime " when discovering secrets . The player controls Link 's sword by swinging the Wii Remote . Other attacks are triggered using similar gestures with the Nunchuk . Unique to the GameCube version is the ability for the player to control the camera freely , without entering a special " lookaround " mode required by the Wii ; however , in the GameCube version , only two of Link 's secondary weapons can be equipped at a time , as opposed to four in the Wii version .

In the 1770s Pierre Jaquet-Droz , a Swiss watchmaker , built a mechanical doll ( automata ) that could write holding a quill pen . By switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters , and hence different messages , could be produced . In effect , it could be mechanically " programmed " to read instructions . Along with two other complex machines , the doll is at the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuchâtel , Switzerland , and still operates .
Cognitive neuroscientists consider memory as the retention , reactivation , and reconstruction of the experience-independent internal representation . The term of internal representation implies that such definition of memory contains two components : the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level , and the underpinning physical neural changes ( Dudai 2007 ) . The latter component is also called engram or memory traces ( Semon 1904 ) . Some neuroscientists and psychologists mistakenly equate the concept of engram and memory , broadly conceiving all persisting after-effects of experiences as memory ; others argue against this notion that memory does not exist until it is revealed in behavior or thought ( Moscovitch 2007 ) .
Asthma is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms , forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV1 ) , and peak expiratory flow rate . Asthma may also be classified as atopic ( extrinsic ) or non-atopic ( intrinsic ) , based on whether symptoms are precipitated by allergens ( atopic ) or not ( non-atopic ) . While asthma is classified based on severity , at the moment there is no clear method for classifying different subgroups of asthma beyond this system . Finding ways to identify subgroups that respond well to different types of treatments is a current critical goal of asthma research .
In Paris ' Roman era , its main cemetery was located to the outskirts of the Left Bank settlement , but this changed with the rise of Catholicism , where most every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes . With Paris ' growth many of these , particularly the city 's largest cemetery , les Innocents , were filled to overflowing , creating quite unsanitary conditions for the capital . When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786 , the contents of all Paris ' parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of Paris ' stone mines outside the " Porte d'Enfer " city gate , today place Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th arrondissement . The process of moving bones from Cimetière des Innocents to the catacombs took place between 1786 and 1814 ; part of the network of tunnels and remains can be visited today on the official tour of the catacombs .
Two recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the Thames in the London area . In 1999 , the remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the foreshore north of Vauxhall Bridge . This bridge either crossed the Thames , or went to a now lost island in the river . Dendrology dated the timbers to 1500 BC . In 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure , dated to 4500 BC , were found on the Thames foreshore , south of Vauxhall Bridge . The function of the mesolithic structure is not known . Both structures are on South Bank , at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the River Thames .
After the Lisa 's announcement , John Dvorak discussed rumors of a mysterious " MacIntosh " project at Apple in February 1983 . The company announced the Macintosh 128K—manufactured at an Apple factory in Fremont , California—in October 1983 , followed by an 18-page brochure included with various magazines in December . The Macintosh was introduced by a US $ 1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial , " 1984 " . It most notably aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22 , 1984 , and is now considered a " watershed event " and a " masterpiece . " Regis McKenna called the ad " more successful than the Mac itself . " " 1984 " used an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh ( indicated by a Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top ) as a means of saving humanity from the " conformity " of IBM 's attempts to dominate the computer industry . The ad alludes to George Orwell 's novel , Nineteen Eighty-Four , which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised " Big Brother . "
Oklahoma City is protected by the Oklahoma City Fire Department ( OKCFD ) , which employs 1015 paid , professional firefighters . The current Chief of Department is G. Keith Bryant , the department is also commanded by three Deputy Chiefs , who – along with the department chief – oversee the Operational Services , Prevention Services , and Support Services bureaus . The OKCFD currently operates out of 37 fire stations , located throughout the city in six battalions . The OKCFD also operates a fire apparatus fleet of 36 engines ( including 30 paramedic engines ) , 13 ladders , 16 brush patrol units , six water tankers , two hazardous materials units , one Technical Rescue Unit , one Air Supply Unit , six Arson Investigation Units , and one Rehabilitation Unit . Each engine is staffed with a driver , an officer , and one to two firefighters , while each ladder company is staffed with a driver , an officer , and one firefighter . Minimum staffing per shift is 213 personnel . The Oklahoma City Fire Department responds to over 70,000 emergency calls annually .
Tajikistan means the " Land of the Tajiks " . The suffix " -stan " ( Persian : ـستان‎‎ -stān ) is Persian for " place of " or " country " and Tajik is , most likely , the name of a pre-Islamic ( before the seventh century A.D. ) tribe . According to the Library of Congress 's 1997 Country Study of Tajikistan , it is difficult to definitively state the origins of the word " Tajik " because the term is " embroiled in twentieth-century political disputes about whether Turkic or Iranian peoples were the original inhabitants of Central Asia . "
Capital punishment was suspended in the United States from 1972 through 1976 primarily as a result of the Supreme Court 's decision in Furman v. Georgia . The last pre-Furman execution was that of Luis Monge on June 2 , 1967 . In this case , the court found that the death penalty was being imposed in an unconstitutional manner , on the grounds of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution . The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be per se unconstitutional .
Poultry is available fresh or frozen , as whole birds or as joints ( cuts ) , bone-in or deboned , seasoned in various ways , raw or ready cooked . The meatiest parts of a bird are the flight muscles on its chest , called " breast " meat , and the walking muscles on the legs , called the " thigh " and " drumstick " . The wings are also eaten ( Buffalo wings are a popular example in the United States ) and may be split into three segments , the meatier " drumette " , the " wingette " ( also called the " flat " ) , and the wing tip ( also called the " flapper " ) . In Japan , the wing is frequently separated , and these parts are referred to as 手羽元 ( teba-moto " wing base " ) and 手羽先 ( teba-saki " wing tip " ) .
It is speculated by some archaeologists that Sumerian speakers were farmers who moved down from the north , after perfecting irrigation agriculture there . The Ubaid pottery of southern Mesopotamia has been connected via Choga Mami transitional ware to the pottery of the Samarra period culture ( c. 5700 – 4900 BC C-14 ) in the north , who were the first to practice a primitive form of irrigation agriculture along the middle Tigris River and its tributaries . The connection is most clearly seen at Tell Awayli ( Oueilli , Oueili ) near Larsa , excavated by the French in the 1980s , where eight levels yielded pre-Ubaid pottery resembling Samarran ware . According to this theory , farming peoples spread down into southern Mesopotamia because they had developed a temple-centered social organization for mobilizing labor and technology for water control , enabling them to survive and prosper in a difficult environment .

Evidence exists that native peoples traveled through Oklahoma as early as the last ice age . Ancestors of the Wichita and Caddo lived in what is now Oklahoma . The Panhandle culture peoples were precontact residents of the panhandle region . The westernmost center of the Mississippian culture was Spiro Mounds , in what is now Spiro , Oklahoma , which flourished between AD 850 and 1450 . Spaniard Francisco Vásquez de Coronado traveled through the state in 1541 , but French explorers claimed the area in the 1700s and it remained under French rule until 1803 , when all the French territory west of the Mississippi River was purchased by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase .
This dissociation aims to make the early steps ( offering , promising , requesting an advantage ) of a corrupt deal already an offence and , thus , to give a clear signal ( from a criminal-policy point-of-view ) that bribery is not acceptable . [ citation needed ] Furthermore , such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties ( the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker ) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal . In addition , there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding , for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a " fee " to the decision maker to obtain a favorable decision . A working definition of corruption is also provided as follows in article 3 of the Civil Law Convention on Corruption ( ETS 174 ) : For the purpose of this Convention , " corruption " means requesting , offering , giving or accepting , directly or indirectly , a bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof , which distorts the proper performance of any duty or behavior required of the recipient of the bribe , the undue advantage or the prospect thereof .
A perceived turning point was when Blair controversially allied himself with US President George W. Bush in supporting the Iraq War , which caused him to lose much of his political support . The UN Secretary-General , among many , considered the war illegal . The Iraq War was deeply unpopular in most western countries , with Western governments divided in their support and under pressure from worldwide popular protests . The decisions that led up to the Iraq war and its subsequent conduct are currently the subject of Sir John Chilcot 's Iraq Inquiry .
The design and function of department stores in Germany followed the lead of London , Paris and New York . Germany used to have a number of department stores ; nowadays only a few of them remain . Next to some smaller , independent department stores these are Karstadt ( in 2010 taken over by Nicolas Berggruen , also operating the KaDeWe in Berlin , the Alsterhaus in Hamburg and the Oberpollinger in Munich ) , GALERIA Kaufhof ( part of the Metro AG ) . Others like Hertie , Wertheim and Horten AG were taken over by others and either fully integrated or later closed .
The ceremonial county of Somerset consists of a two-tier non-metropolitan county , which is administered by Somerset County Council and five district councils , and two unitary authority areas ( whose councils combine the functions of a county and a district ) . The five districts of Somerset are West Somerset , South Somerset , Taunton Deane , Mendip , and Sedgemoor . The two unitary authorities — which were established on 1 April 1996 following the break-up of the short-lived county of Avon — are North Somerset , and Bath & North East Somerset .
Frederick Lynch , the author of Invisible Victims : White Males and the Crisis of Affirmative Action , did a study on white males that said they were victims of reverse discrimination . Lynch explains that these white men felt frustrated and unfairly victimized by affirmative action . Shelby Steele , another author against affirmative action , wanted to see affirmative action go back to its original meaning of enforcing equal opportunity . He argued that blacks had to take full responsibility in their education and in maintaining a job . Steele believes that there is still a long way to go in America to reach our goals of eradicating discrimination .
In 1821 , Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of Neptune 's neighbour Uranus . Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables , leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational interaction . In 1843 , John Couch Adams began work on the orbit of Uranus using the data he had . Via Cambridge Observatory director James Challis , he requested extra data from Sir George Airy , the Astronomer Royal , who supplied it in February 1844 . Adams continued to work in 1845–46 and produced several different estimates of a new planet .
There are many different patterns of gas exchange demonstrated by different groups of insects . Gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous and diffusive ventilation , to discontinuous gas exchange . :65–68 During continuous gas exchange , oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released in a continuous cycle . In discontinuous gas exchange , however , the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at rest . Diffusive ventilation is simply a form of continuous gas exchange that occurs by diffusion rather than physically taking in the oxygen . Some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration . As larvae , many insects have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water , while others need to rise to the water surface to replenish air supplies which may be held or trapped in special structures .
The first President of the Bank was Wim Duisenberg , the former president of the Dutch central bank and the European Monetary Institute . While Duisenberg had been the head of the EMI ( taking over from Alexandre Lamfalussy of Belgium ) just before the ECB came into existence , the French government wanted Jean-Claude Trichet , former head of the French central bank , to be the ECB 's first president . The French argued that since the ECB was to be located in Germany , its president should be French . This was opposed by the German , Dutch and Belgian governments who saw Duisenberg as a guarantor of a strong euro . Tensions were abated by a gentleman 's agreement in which Duisenberg would stand down before the end of his mandate , to be replaced by Trichet .
In the Low Middle Ages , Catalan went through a golden age , reaching a peak of maturity and cultural richness . Examples include the work of Majorcan polymath Ramon Llull ( 1232–1315 ) , the Four Great Chronicles ( 13th–14th centuries ) , and the Valencian school of poetry culminating in Ausiàs March ( 1397–1459 ) . By the 15th century , the city of Valencia had become the sociocultural center of the Crown of Aragon , and Catalan was present all over the Mediterranean world . During this period , the Royal Chancery propagated a highly standardized language . Catalan was widely used as an official language in Sicily until the 15th century , and in Sardinia until the 17th . During this period , the language was what Costa Carreras terms " one of the 'great languages ' of medieval Europe " .
In 1838 the situation was slightly the same as in 1831 . Muhammad Ali of Egypt was not happy about lack of his control and power in Syria , he resumed military actions . The Ottoman army lost to Egyptians at the Battle of Nezib on June 24 , 1839 . The Ottoman Empire was saved by Great Britain , Austria , Prussia and Russia by signing a convention in London in July 15 , 1840 to grant Muhammad Ali and his descendants the right to inherit power in Egypt in exchange for removal of Egyptian military forces from Syria and Lebanon . Moreover , Muhammad Ali had to admit a formal dependence from the Ottoman sultan . After Muhammad Ali refused to obey the requirements of the London convention , the allied Anglo-Austrian fleet blocked the Delta , bombarded Beirut and captured Acre . Muhammad Ali accepted the conditions of the London convention in 1840 .
High hopes for the AFL waned when interim commissioner Ed Policy announced his resignation , citing the obsolescence of his position in the reformatted league . Two weeks later , the Los Angeles Avengers announced that they were formally folding the franchise . One month later , the league missed the deadline to formally ratify the new collective bargaining agreement and announced that it was eliminating health insurance for the players . Progress on the return stalled , and no announcements were made regarding the future of the league .
During the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony and only six weeks before the wedding of Charles , Prince of Wales , and Lady Diana Spencer , six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down The Mall on her horse , Burmese . Police later discovered that the shots were blanks . The 17-year-old assailant , Marcus Sarjeant , was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three . The Queen 's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised . From April to September 1982 , the Queen remained anxious but proud of her son , Prince Andrew , who was serving with British forces during the Falklands War . On 9 July , the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder , Michael Fagan , in the room with her . Remaining calm and through two calls to the Palace police switchboard , she spoke to Fagan while he sat at the foot of her bed until assistance arrived seven minutes later . Though she hosted US President Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visited his Californian ranch in 1983 , she was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada , one of her Caribbean realms , without informing her .
Because the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials , a given bipolar n–p–n transistor tends to be swifter than an equivalent p–n–p transistor . GaAs has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors . It is for this reason that GaAs is used in high-frequency applications . A relatively recent FET development , the high-electron-mobility transistor ( HEMT ) , has a heterostructure ( junction between different semiconductor materials ) of aluminium gallium arsenide ( AlGaAs ) -gallium arsenide ( GaAs ) which has twice the electron mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction . Because of their high speed and low noise , HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12 GHz . HEMTs based on gallium nitride and aluminium gallium nitride ( AlGaN/GaN HEMTs ) provide a still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications .
Utrecht city has an active cultural life , and in the Netherlands is second only to Amsterdam . There are several theatres and theatre companies . The 1941 main city theatre was built by Dudok . Besides theatres there is a large number of cinemas including three arthouse cinemas . Utrecht is host to the international Early Music Festival ( Festival Oude Muziek , for music before 1800 ) and the Netherlands Film Festival . The city has an important classical music hall Vredenburg ( 1979 by Herman Hertzberger ) . Its acoustics are considered among the best of the 20th-century original music halls . [ citation needed ] The original Vredenburg music hall has been redeveloped as part of the larger station area redevelopment plan and in 2014 has gained additional halls that allowed its merger with the rock club Tivoli and the SJU jazzpodium . There are several other venues for music throughout the city . Young musicians are educated in the conservatory , a department of the Utrecht School of the Arts . There is a specialised museum of automatically playing musical instruments .
As the century wore on , the factions slowly began to adopt more coherent political tendencies as the interests of their power bases began to diverge . The Whig party 's initial base of support from the great aristocratic families , widened to include the emerging industrial interests and wealthy merchants . As well as championing constitutional monarchy with strict limits on the monarch 's power , the Whigs adamantly opposed a Catholic king as a threat to liberty , and believed in extending toleration to nonconformist Protestants , or dissenters . A major influence on the Whigs were the liberal political ideas of John Locke , and the concepts of universal rights employed by Locke and Algernon Sidney .
The term Carnival is traditionally used in areas with a large Catholic presence . However , the Philippines , a predominantly Roman Catholic country , does not celebrate Carnival anymore since the dissolution of the Manila Carnival after 1939 , the last carnival in the country . In historically Lutheran countries , the celebration is known as Fastelavn , and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans and Methodists , pre-Lenten celebrations , along with penitential observances , occur on Shrove Tuesday . In Eastern Orthodox nations , Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent . In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands , the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 ( often at 11:11 a.m. ) . This dates back to celebrations before the Advent season or with harvest celebrations of St. Martin 's Day .
Assembly of desktop computers for the North American market formerly took place at Dell plants in Austin , Texas ( original location ) and Lebanon , Tennessee ( opened in 1999 ) , which have been closed in 2008 and early 2009 , respectively . The plant in Winston-Salem , North Carolina received $ 280 million USD in incentives from the state and opened in 2005 , but ceased operations in November 2010 , and Dell 's contract with the state requires them to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions . Most of the work that used to take place in Dell 's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico , or some of Dell 's own factories overseas . The Miami , Florida facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation , while Dell continues to produce its servers ( its most profitable products ) in Austin , Texas .
Bioscience is the overall major in which undergraduate students who are interested in general well-being take in college . Immunology is a branch of bioscience for undergraduate programs but the major gets specified as students move on for graduate program in immunology . The aim of immunology is to study the health of humans and animals through effective yet consistent research , ( AAAAI , 2013 ) . The most important thing about being immunologists is the research because it is the biggest portion of their jobs .
Each season premieres with the audition round , taking place in different cities . The audition episodes typically feature a mix of potential finalists , interesting characters and woefully inadequate contestants . Each successful contestant receives a golden ticket to proceed on to the next round in Hollywood . Based on their performances during the Hollywood round ( Las Vegas round for seasons 10 onwards ) , 24 to 36 contestants are selected by the judges to participate in the semifinals . From the semifinal onwards the contestants perform their songs live , with the judges making their critiques after each performance . The contestants are voted for by the viewing public , and the outcome of the public votes is then revealed in the results show typically on the following night . The results shows feature group performances by the contestants as well as guest performers . The Top-three results show also features the homecoming events for the Top 3 finalists . The season reaches its climax in a two-hour results finale show , where the winner of the season is revealed .
Data compression can be viewed as a special case of data differencing : Data differencing consists of producing a difference given a source and a target , with patching producing a target given a source and a difference , while data compression consists of producing a compressed file given a target , and decompression consists of producing a target given only a compressed file . Thus , one can consider data compression as data differencing with empty source data , the compressed file corresponding to a " difference from nothing . " This is the same as considering absolute entropy ( corresponding to data compression ) as a special case of relative entropy ( corresponding to data differencing ) with no initial data .
White LEDs can also be made by coating near-ultraviolet ( NUV ) LEDs with a mixture of high-efficiency europium-based phosphors that emit red and blue , plus copper and aluminium-doped zinc sulfide ( ZnS : Cu , Al ) that emits green . This is a method analogous to the way fluorescent lamps work . This method is less efficient than blue LEDs with YAG : Ce phosphor , as the Stokes shift is larger , so more energy is converted to heat , but yields light with better spectral characteristics , which render color better . Due to the higher radiative output of the ultraviolet LEDs than of the blue ones , both methods offer comparable brightness . A concern is that UV light may leak from a malfunctioning light source and cause harm to human eyes or skin .
Sheahon Zenger was introduced as KU 's new athletic director in January 2011 . Under former athletic director Lew Perkins , the department 's budget increased from $ 27.2 million in 2003 ( 10th in the conference ) to currently over $ 50 million thanks in large part to money raised from a new priority seating policy at Allen Fieldhouse , a new $ 26.67 million eight-year contract with Adidas replacing an existing contract with Nike , and a new $ 40.2 million seven-year contract with ESPN Regional Television . The additional funds brought improvements to the university , including :
The competition formed as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League , which was originally founded in 1888 , and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal . The deal was worth £1 billion a year domestically as of 2013–14 , with BSkyB and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively . The league generates €2.2 billion per year in domestic and international television rights . In 2014/15 , teams were apportioned revenues of £1.6 billion .
At the same time the order found itself face to face with the Renaissance . It struggled against pagan tendencies in Renaissance humanism , in Italy through Dominici and Savonarola , in Germany through the theologians of Cologne but it also furnished humanism with such advanced writers as Francesco Colonna ( probably the writer of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili ) and Matteo Bandello . Many Dominicans took part in the artistic activity of the age , the most prominent being Fra Angelico and Fra Bartolomeo .
At age eight , Beyoncé and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group . They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl 's Tyme , and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston . After seeing the group , R & B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search , the largest talent show on national TV at the time . Girl 's Tyme failed to win , and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good . In 1995 Beyoncé 's father resigned from his job to manage the group . The move reduced Beyoncé 's family 's income by half , and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments . Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R & B girl groups . The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records , moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording , only to be cut by the company . This put further strain on the family , and Beyoncé 's parents separated . On October 5 , 1995 , Dwayne Wiggins 's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group . In 1996 , the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music , the Knowles family reunited , and shortly after , the group got a contract with Columbia Records .
The economy relies heavily on investment and support from Armenians abroad . Before independence , Armenia 's economy was largely industry-based – chemicals , electronics , machinery , processed food , synthetic rubber , and textile – and highly dependent on outside resources . The republic had developed a modern industrial sector , supplying machine tools , textiles , and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy . Recently , the Intel Corporation agreed to open a research center in Armenia , in addition to other technology companies , signalling the growth of the technology industry in Armenia .
Apple spent $ 2.5 million purchasing all 39 advertising pages in a special , post-election issue of Newsweek , and ran a " Test Drive a Macintosh " promotion , in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards . While 200,000 people participated , dealers disliked the promotion , the supply of computers was insufficient for demand , and many were returned in such a bad condition that they could no longer be sold . This marketing campaign caused CEO John Sculley to raise the price from US $ 1,995 to US $ 2,495 ( about $ 5,200 when adjusted for inflation in 2010 ) . The computer sold well , nonetheless , reportedly outselling the IBM PCjr which also began shipping early that year . By April 1984 the company sold 50,000 Macintoshes , and hoped for 70,000 by early May and almost 250,000 by the end of the year .
Most birds can fly , which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes . Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding , feeding , and predator avoidance and escape . Birds have various adaptations for flight , including a lightweight skeleton , two large flight muscles , the pectoralis ( which accounts for 15 % of the total mass of the bird ) and the supracoracoideus , as well as a modified forelimb ( wing ) that serves as an aerofoil . Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species ' type of flight ; many birds combine powered , flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight . About 60 extant bird species are flightless , as were many extinct birds . Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands , probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators . Though flightless , penguins use similar musculature and movements to " fly " through the water , as do auks , shearwaters and dippers .
In modern times , a process of devolution in the United Kingdom has decentralised power once again . Since the 1997 referendums in Scotland and Wales and the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland , three of the four constituent countries of the UK now have some level of autonomy . Government has been devolved to the Scottish Parliament , the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly . England does not have its own parliament and English affairs continue to be decided by the Westminster Parliament . In 1998 a set of eight unelected Regional assemblies , or chambers , was created to support the English Regional Development Agencies , but these were abolished between 2008 and 2010 . The Regions of England continue to be used in certain governmental administrative functions .
Heritage buildings constructed during the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras showcase Indo-Islamic architecture influenced by Medieval , Mughal and European styles . After the 1908 flooding of the Musi River , the city was expanded and civic monuments constructed , particularly during the rule of Mir Osman Ali Khan ( the VIIth Nizam ) , whose patronage of architecture led to him being referred to as the maker of modern Hyderabad . In 2012 , the government of India declared Hyderabad the first " Best heritage city of India " .
In 1822 , the citizens of Boston voted to change the official name from " the Town of Boston " to " the City of Boston " , and on March 4 , 1822 , the people of Boston accepted the charter incorporating the City . At the time Boston was chartered as a city , the population was about 46,226 , while the area of the city was only 4.7 square miles ( 12 km2 ) .
Located in the Laurelhurst neighborhood , Seattle Children 's , formerly Children 's Hospital and Regional Medical Center , is the pediatric referral center for Washington , Alaska , Montana , and Idaho . The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has a campus in the Eastlake neighborhood . The University District is home to the University of Washington Medical Center which , along with Harborview , is operated by the University of Washington . Seattle is also served by a Veterans Affairs hospital on Beacon Hill , a third campus of Swedish in Ballard , and Northwest Hospital and Medical Center near Northgate Mall .
Allied submarines did not adopt a defensive posture and wait for the enemy to attack . Within hours after the Pearl Harbor attack , in retribution against Japan , Roosevelt promulgated a new doctrine : unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan . This meant sinking any warship , commercial vessel , or passenger ship in Axis-controlled waters , without warning and without help to survivors . [ nb 13 ] At the outbreak of the war in the Pacific the Dutch Admiral in charge of the naval defense of the East Indies , Conrad Helfrich , gave instructions to wage war aggressively . His small force of submarines sank more Japanese ships in the first weeks of the war than the entire British and US navies together , an exploit which earned him the nickname " Ship-a-day Helfrich " . The Dutch force were in fact the first to sink an enemy warship ; On 24 December 1941 , HNLMS K XVI torpedoed and sank the Japanese destroyer Sagiri .
A standard dialect ( also known as a standardized dialect or " standard language " ) is a dialect that is supported by institutions . Such institutional support may include government recognition or designation ; presentation as being the " correct " form of a language in schools ; published grammars , dictionaries , and textbooks that set forth a correct spoken and written form ; and an extensive formal literature that employs that dialect ( prose , poetry , non-fiction , etc. ) . There may be multiple standard dialects associated with a single language . For example , Standard American English , Standard British English , Standard Canadian English , Standard Indian English , Standard Australian English , and Standard Philippine English may all be said to be standard dialects of the English language .
The above are further subdivided into 31 planes of existence . [ web 4 ] Rebirths in some of the higher heavens , known as the Śuddhāvāsa Worlds or Pure Abodes , can be attained only by skilled Buddhist practitioners known as anāgāmis ( non-returners ) . Rebirths in the Ārūpyadhātu ( formless realms ) can be attained by only those who can meditate on the arūpajhānas , the highest object of meditation .
After the Civil War , population expansion , railroad construction , and the disappearance of the buffalo herds heightened military tensions on the Great Plains . Several tribes , especially the Sioux and Comanche , fiercely resisted confinement to reservations . The main role of the Army was to keep indigenous peoples on reservations and to end their wars against settlers and each other , William Tecumseh Sherman and Philip Sheridan were in charge . A famous victory for the Plains Nations was the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 , when Col. George Armstrong Custer and two hundred plus members of the 7th Cavalry were killed by a force consisting of Native Americans from the Lakota , Northern Cheyenne , and Arapaho nations . The last significant conflict came in 1891 .
Regular script has been attributed to Zhong Yao , of the Eastern Han to Cao Wei period ( c. 151–230 AD ) , who has been called the " father of regular script " . However , some scholars postulate that one person alone could not have developed a new script which was universally adopted , but could only have been a contributor to its gradual formation . The earliest surviving pieces written in regular script are copies of Yao 's works , including at least one copied by Wang Xizhi . This new script , which is the dominant modern Chinese script , developed out of a neatly written form of early semi-cursive , with addition of the pause ( 頓/顿 dùn ) technique to end horizontal strokes , plus heavy tails on strokes which are written to the downward-right diagonal . Thus , early regular script emerged from a neat , formal form of semi-cursive , which had itself emerged from neo-clerical ( a simplified , convenient form of clerical script ) . It then matured further in the Eastern Jin dynasty in the hands of the " Sage of Calligraphy " , Wang Xizhi , and his son Wang Xianzhi . It was not , however , in widespread use at that time , and most writers continued using neo-clerical , or a somewhat semi-cursive form of it , for daily writing , while the conservative bafen clerical script remained in use on some stelae , alongside some semi-cursive , but primarily neo-clerical .
The Namibian Constitution adopted in February 1990 incorporated protection for human rights , compensation for state expropriations of private property , an independent judiciary and an executive presidency ( the constituent assembly became the national assembly ) . The country officially became independent on 21 March 1990 . Sam Nujoma was sworn in as the first President of Namibia watched by Nelson Mandela ( who had been released from prison the previous month ) and representatives from 147 countries , including 20 heads of state . Walvis Bay was ceded to Namibia in 1994 upon the end of Apartheid in South Africa . [ citation needed ]
The Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt considered the most important centre of the maritime transport in the Middle East , connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea . Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work , it allows ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa . The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfiq at the city of Suez . Ismailia lies on its west bank , 3 km ( 1.9 mi ) from the half-way point .
The Kinsey scale has been praised for dismissing the dichotomous classification of sexual orientation and allowing for a new perspective on human sexuality . However , the scale has been criticized because it is still not a true continuum . Despite seven categories being able to provide a more accurate description of sexual orientation than a dichotomous scale it is still difficult to determine which category individuals should be assigned to . In a major study comparing sexual response in homosexual males and females , Masters and Johnson discuss the difficulty of assigning the Kinsey ratings to participants . Particularly , they found it difficult to determine the relative amount heterosexual and homosexual experience and response in a person 's history when using the scale . They report finding it difficult to assign ratings 2-4 for individuals with a large number of heterosexual and homosexual experiences . When , there is a lot of heterosexual and homosexual experiences in one 's history it becomes difficult for that individual to be fully objective in assessing the relative amount of each .
For over a century , New Haven citizens had fought in the colonial militia alongside regular British forces , as in the French and Indian War . As the American Revolution approached , General David Wooster and other influential residents hoped that the conflict with the government in Britain could be resolved short of rebellion . On 23 April 1775 , which is still celebrated in New Haven as Powder House Day , the Second Company , Governor 's Foot Guard , of New Haven entered the struggle against the governing British parliament . Under Captain Benedict Arnold , they broke into the powder house to arm themselves and began a three-day march to Cambridge , Massachusetts . Other New Haven militia members were on hand to escort George Washington from his overnight stay in New Haven on his way to Cambridge . Contemporary reports , from both sides , remark on the New Haven volunteers ' professional military bearing , including uniforms .
Dumbwaiters are small freight elevators that are intended to carry food , books or other small freight loads rather than passengers . They often connect kitchens to rooms on other floors . they usually do not have the same safety features found in passenger elevators , like various ropes for redundancy . they have a lower capacity , and they can be up to 1 meter ( 3 ft. ) tall . there 's a control panel at every stop , that mimics the ones found in passenger elevators , like calling , door control , floor selection .
The Early Jurassic spans from 200 million years to 175 million years ago . The climate was much more humid than the Triassic , and as a result , the world was very tropical . In the oceans , Plesiosaurs , Ichthyosaurs and Ammonites fill waters as the dominant races of the seas . On land , dinosaurs and other reptiles stake their claim as the dominant race of the land , with species such as Dilophosaurus at the top . The first true crocodiles evolved , pushing out the large amphibians to near extinction . All-in-all , reptiles rise to rule the world . Meanwhile , the first true mammals evolve , but remained relatively small sized .
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 ( ESA ; 16 U.S.C . § 1531 et seq . ) is one of the few dozens of United States environmental laws passed in the 1970s , and serves as the enacting legislation to carry out the provisions outlined in The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) . The ESA was signed into law by President Richard Nixon on December 28 , 1973 , it was designed to protect critically imperiled species from extinction as a " consequence of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation . " The U.S. Supreme Court found that " the plain intent of Congress in enacting " the ESA " was to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction , whatever the cost . " The Act is administered by two federal agencies , the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ( FWS ) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
Immanuel Kant ( 1724–1804 ) tried to reconcile rationalism and religious belief , individual freedom and political authority , as well as map out a view of the public sphere through private and public reason . Kant 's work continued to shape German thought , and indeed all of European philosophy , well into the 20th century . Mary Wollstonecraft was one of England 's earliest feminist philosophers . She argued for a society based on reason , and that women , as well as men , should be treated as rational beings . She is best known for her work A Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1791 ) .
In Theravāda Buddhism , the cause of human existence and suffering is identified as craving , which carries with it the various defilements . These various defilements are traditionally summed up as greed , hatred and delusion . These are believed deeply rooted afflictions of the mind that create suffering and stress . To be free from suffering and stress , these defilements must be permanently uprooted through internal investigation , analyzing , experiencing , and understanding of the true nature of those defilements by using jhāna , a technique of the Noble Eightfold Path . It then leads the meditator to realize the Four Noble Truths , Enlightenment and Nibbāna . Nibbāna is the ultimate goal of Theravadins .
During up-peak mode ( also called moderate incoming traffic ) , elevator cars in a group are recalled to the lobby to provide expeditious service to passengers arriving at the building , most typically in the morning as people arrive for work or at the conclusion of a lunch-time period . Elevators are dispatched one-by-one when they reach a pre-determined passenger load , or when they have had their doors opened for a certain period of time . The next elevator to be dispatched usually has its hall lantern or a " this car leaving next " sign illuminated to encourage passengers to make maximum use of the available elevator system capacity . Some elevator banks are programmed so that at least one car will always return to the lobby floor and park whenever it becomes free .
In February 1925 , the Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri summoned him to the Vatican and informed him of Pope Pius XI 's decision to appoint him as the Apostolic Visitor to Bulgaria ( 1925–35 ) . On 3 March , Pius XI also named him for consecration as titular archbishop of Areopolis , Jordan . Roncalli was initially reluctant about a mission to Bulgaria , but he would soon relent . His nomination as apostolic visitor was made official on 19 March . Roncalli was consecrated by Giovanni Tacci Porcelli in the church of San Carlo alla Corso in Rome . After he was consecrated , he introduced his family to Pope Pius XI . He chose as his episcopal motto Obedientia et Pax ( " Obedience and Peace " ) , which became his guiding motto . While he was in Bulgaria , an earthquake struck in a town not too far from where he was . Unaffected , he wrote to his sisters Ancilla and Maria and told them both that he was fine .
Continuing his experiments in Brantford , Bell brought home a working model of his telephone . On August 3 , 1876 , from the telegraph office in Mount Pleasant five miles ( eight km ) away from Brantford , Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready . With curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses , faint voices were heard replying . The following night , he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford , four miles ( six km ) distant , along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences , and laid through a tunnel . This time , guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing . These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances .
As of the early 21st century , Christianity has approximately 2.4 billion adherents . The faith represents about a third of the world 's population and is the largest religion in the world . Christians have composed about 33 percent of the world 's population for around 100 years . The largest Christian denomination is the Roman Catholic Church , with 1.17 billion adherents , representing half of all Christians .
China Mobile had more than 2,300 base stations suspended due to power disruption or severe telecommunication traffic congestion . Half of the wireless communications were lost in the Sichuan province . China Unicom 's service in Wenchuan and four nearby counties was cut off , with more than 700 towers suspended .
Flower ontogeny uses a combination of genes normally responsible for forming new shoots . The most primitive flowers probably had a variable number of flower parts , often separate from ( but in contact with ) each other . The flowers tended to grow in a spiral pattern , to be bisexual ( in plants , this means both male and female parts on the same flower ) , and to be dominated by the ovary ( female part ) . As flowers evolved , some variations developed parts fused together , with a much more specific number and design , and with either specific sexes per flower or plant or at least " ovary-inferior " .
The U.S. Census Bureau reports a 2010 population of 129,779 , with 47,094 households and 25,854 families within the city of New Haven . The population density is 6,859.8 people per square mile ( 2,648.6/km² ) . There are 52,941 housing units at an average density of 2,808.5 per square mile ( 1,084.4/km² ) . The racial makeup of the city is 42.6 % White , 35.4 % African American , 0.5 % Native American , 4.6 % Asian , 0.1 % Pacific Islander , 12.9 % from other races , and 3.9 % from two or more races . Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 27.4 % of the population . Non-Hispanic Whites were 31.8 % of the population in 2010 , down from 69.6 % in 1970 . The city 's demography is shifting rapidly : New Haven has always been a city of immigrants and currently the Latino population is growing rapidly . Previous influxes among ethnic groups have been African-Americans in the postwar era , and Irish , Italian and ( to a lesser degree ) Slavic peoples in the prewar period .
In the beginning of 1996 , several human rights groups brought cases to hold Shell accountable for alleged human rights violations in Nigeria , including summary execution , crimes against humanity , torture , inhumane treatment and arbitrary arrest and detention . In particular , Shell stood accused of collaborating in the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other leaders of the Ogoni tribe of southern Nigeria , who were hanged in 1995 by Nigeria 's then military rulers . The lawsuits were brought against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson , the head of its Nigerian operation . In 2009 , Shell agreed to pay $ 15.5m in a legal settlement . Shell has not accepted any liability over the allegations against it .
Three of the women claimed he had grabbed their breasts , a fourth said he placed his hand under her skirt on her buttock . A fifth woman claimed Schwarzenegger tried to take off her bathing suit in a hotel elevator , and the last said he pulled her onto his lap and asked her about a sex act .
Some experiments on very resinous Longleaf Pine specimens indicate an increase in strength , due to the resin which increases the strength when dry . Such resin-saturated heartwood is called " fat lighter " . Structures built of fat lighter are almost impervious to rot and termites ; however they are very flammable . Stumps of old longleaf pines are often dug , split into small pieces and sold as kindling for fires . Stumps thus dug may actually remain a century or more since being cut . Spruce impregnated with crude resin and dried is also greatly increased in strength thereby .
Feynman was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society ( ForMemRS ) in 1965 . At this time in the early 1960s , Feynman exhausted himself by working on multiple major projects at the same time , including a request , while at Caltech , to " spruce up " the teaching of undergraduates . After three years devoted to the task , he produced a series of lectures that eventually became The Feynman Lectures on Physics . He wanted a picture of a drumhead sprinkled with powder to show the modes of vibration at the beginning of the book . Concerned over the connections to drugs and rock and roll that could be made from the image , the publishers changed the cover to plain red , though they included a picture of him playing drums in the foreword . The Feynman Lectures on Physics occupied two physicists , Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands , as part-time co-authors for several years . Even though the books were not adopted by most universities as textbooks , they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics . Many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books , including The Character of Physical Law , QED : The Strange Theory of Light and Matter , Statistical Mechanics , Lectures on Gravitation , and the Feynman Lectures on Computation .
Southampton Water has the benefit of a double high tide , with two high tide peaks , making the movement of large ships easier . This is not caused as popularly supposed by the presence of the Isle of Wight , but is a function of the shape and depth of the English Channel . In this area the general water flow is distorted by more local conditions reaching across to France .
At the time of her accession , the government was led by the Whig prime minister Lord Melbourne , who at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced Queen , who relied on him for advice . Charles Greville supposed that the widowed and childless Melbourne was " passionately fond of her as he might be of his daughter if he had one " , and Victoria probably saw him as a father figure . Her coronation took place on 28 June 1838 at Westminster Abbey . Over 400,000 visitors came to London for the celebrations . She became the first sovereign to take up residence at Buckingham Palace and inherited the revenues of the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall as well as being granted a civil list allowance of £385,000 per year . Financially prudent , she paid off her father 's debts .
There is a variety of annual events , beginning with the relatively new New Year 's Day Parade , fireworks display at the London Eye , the world 's second largest street party , the Notting Hill Carnival is held during the late August Bank Holiday each year . Traditional parades include November 's Lord Mayor 's Show , a centuries-old event celebrating the annual appointment of a new Lord Mayor of the City of London with a procession along the streets of the City , and June 's Trooping the Colour , a formal military pageant performed by regiments of the Commonwealth and British armies to celebrate the Queen 's Official Birthday .
Domestically , Menzies presided over a fairly regulated economy in which utilities were publicly owned , and commercial activity was highly regulated through centralised wage-fixing and high tariff protection . Liberal leaders from Menzies to Malcolm Fraser generally maintained Australia 's high tariff levels . At that time the Liberals ' coalition partner , the Country Party , the older of the two in the coalition ( now known as the " National Party " ) , had considerable influence over the government 's economic policies . It was not until the late 1970s and through their period out of power federally in the 1980s that the party came to be influenced by what was known as the " New Right " – a conservative liberal group who advocated market deregulation , privatisation of public utilities , reductions in the size of government programs and tax cuts .
The Spanish governor was expelled in 1814 . In 1816 , Portugal invaded the recently liberated territory and in 1821 , it was annexed to the Banda Oriental of Brazil . Juan Antonio Lavalleja and his band called the Treinta y Tres Orientales ( " Thirty-Three Orientals " ) re-established the independence of the region in 1825 . Uruguay was consolidated as an independent state in 1828 , with Montevideo as the nation 's capital . In 1829 , the demolition of the city 's fortifications began and plans were made for an extension beyond the Ciudad Vieja , referred to as the " Ciudad Nueva " ( " new city " ) . Urban expansion , however , moved very slowly because of the events that followed .
The use of the term for the Iranian language family was introduced in 1836 by Christian Lassen . Robert Needham Cust used the term Irano-Aryan in 1878 , and Orientalists such as George Abraham Grierson and Max Müller contrasted Irano-Aryan ( Iranian ) and Indo-Aryan ( Indic ) . Some recent scholarship , primarily in German , has revived this convention .
A group is called finite if it has a finite number of elements . The number of elements is called the order of the group . An important class is the symmetric groups SN , the groups of permutations of N letters . For example , the symmetric group on 3 letters S3 is the group consisting of all possible orderings of the three letters ABC , i.e . contains the elements ABC , ACB , ... , up to CBA , in total 6 ( or 3 factorial ) elements . This class is fundamental insofar as any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group SN for a suitable integer N ( Cayley 's theorem ) . Parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above , S3 can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle .
On November 17 , 1987 , SCA acquired CBS Records , which hosted such acts as Michael Jackson , for US $ 2 billion . CBS Inc. , now CBS Corporation , retained the rights to the CBS name for music recordings but granted Sony a temporary license to use the CBS name . CBS Corporation founded a new CBS Records in 2006 , which is distributed by Sony through its RED subsidiary .
With the neoplatonist Plotinus , wrote Nathaniel Alfred Boll ; " there even appears , probably for the first time in Western philosophy , idealism that had long been current in the East even at that time , for it taught ... that the soul has made the world by stepping from eternity into time ... " . Similarly , in regard to passages from the Enneads , " The only space or place of the world is the soul " and " Time must not be assumed to exist outside the soul " , Ludwig Noiré wrote : " For the first time in Western philosophy we find idealism proper in Plotinus , However , Plotinus does not address whether we know external objects , unlike Schopenhauer and other modern philosophers .
Infrared cleaning is a technique used by some Motion picture film scanner , film scanners and flatbed scanners to reduce or remove the effect of dust and scratches upon the finished scan . It works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels ( red , green , and blue ) . The infrared channel , in combination with the other channels , is used to detect the location of scratches and dust . Once located , those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by inpainting .
Mandolin has also been used in blues music , most notably by Ry Cooder , who performed outstanding covers on his very first recordings , Yank Rachell , Johnny " Man " Young , Carl Martin , and Gerry Hundt . Howard Armstrong , who is famous for blues violin , got his start with his father 's mandolin and played in string bands similar to the other Tennessee string bands he came into contact with , with band makeup including " mandolins and fiddles and guitars and banjos . And once in a while they would ease a little ukulele in there and a bass fiddle . " Other blues players from the era 's string bands include Willie Black ( Whistler And His Jug Band ) , Dink Brister , Jim Hill , Charles Johnson , Coley Jones ( Dallas String Band ) , Bobby Leecan ( Need More Band ) , Alfred Martin , Charlie McCoy ( 1909-1950 ) , Al Miller , Matthew Prater , and Herb Quinn .
The playing time of a phonograph record depended on the turntable speed and the groove spacing . At the beginning of the 20th century , the early discs played for two minutes , the same as early cylinder records . The 12-inch disc , introduced by Victor in 1903 , increased the playing time to three and a half minutes . Because a 10-inch 78 rpm record could hold about three minutes of sound per side and the 10-inch size was the standard size for popular music , almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length . For example , when King Oliver 's Creole Jazz Band , including Louis Armstrong on his first recordings , recorded 13 sides at Gennett Records in Richmond , Indiana , in 1923 , one side was 2:09 and four sides were 2:52–2:59 .
Public expenditure health was at 8.9 % of the GDP in 2004 , whereas private expenditure was at 1.3 % . As of 2012 , the HIV/AIDS prevalence was at 2.8 % among 15- to 49-year-olds . Health expenditure was at US $ 30 per capita in 2004 . A large proportion of the population is undernourished , with malnutrition being a problem in Congo-Brazzaville . There were 20 physicians per 100,000 persons in the early 2000s ( decade ) .
Cultural depictions of dogs in art extend back thousands of years to when dogs were portrayed on the walls of caves . Representations of dogs became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed . Hunting scenes were popular in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance . Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance , protection , loyalty , fidelity , faithfulness , watchfulness , and love .
The engagement was not without controversy : Philip had no financial standing , was foreign-born ( though a British subject who had served in the Royal Navy throughout the Second World War ) , and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links . Marion Crawford wrote , " Some of the King 's advisors did not think him good enough for her . He was a prince without a home or kingdom . Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip 's foreign origin . " Elizabeth 's mother was reported , in later biographies , to have opposed the union initially , even dubbing Philip " The Hun " . In later life , however , she told biographer Tim Heald that Philip was " an English gentleman " .
Many medieval philosophers developed arguments for the existence of God , while attempting to comprehend the precise implications of God 's attributes . Reconciling some of those attributes generated important philosophical problems and debates . For example , God 's omniscience may seem to imply that God knows how free agents will choose to act . If God does know this , their ostensible free will might be illusory , or foreknowledge does not imply predestination , and if God does not know it , God may not be omniscient .
Calvary as an English name for the place is derived from the Latin word for skull ( calvaria ) , which is used in the Vulgate translation of " place of a skull " , the explanation given in all four Gospels of the Aramaic word Gûlgaltâ which was the name of the place where Jesus was crucified . The text does not indicate why it was so designated , but several theories have been put forward . One is that as a place of public execution , Calvary may have been strewn with the skulls of abandoned victims ( which would be contrary to Jewish burial traditions , but not Roman ) . Another is that Calvary is named after a nearby cemetery ( which is consistent with both of the proposed modern sites ) . A third is that the name was derived from the physical contour , which would be more consistent with the singular use of the word , i.e. , the place of " a skull " . While often referred to as " Mount Calvary " , it was more likely a small hill or rocky knoll .
USB 2.0 High-Speed Inter-Chip ( HSIC ) is a chip-to-chip variant of USB 2.0 that eliminates the conventional analog transceivers found in normal USB . It was adopted as a standard by the USB Implementers Forum in 2007 . The HSIC physical layer uses about 50 % less power and 75 % less board area compared to traditional USB 2.0 . HSIC uses two signals at 1.2 V and has a throughput of 480 Mbit/s . Maximum PCB trace length for HSIC is 10 cm . It does not have low enough latency to support RAM memory sharing between two chips .
The question of whether the government should intervene or not in the regulation of the cyberspace is a very polemical one . Indeed , for as long as it has existed and by definition , the cyberspace is a virtual space free of any government intervention . Where everyone agree that an improvement on cybersecurity is more than vital , is the government the best actor to solve this issue ? Many government officials and experts think that the government should step in and that there is a crucial need for regulation , mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem . R. Clarke said during a panel discussion at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco , he believes that the " industry only responds when you threaten regulation . If industry does n't respond ( to the threat ) , you have to follow through . " On the other hand , executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary , but think that the government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently .
The report " Mary : Faith and Hope in Christ " , by the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission , concluded that the teaching about Mary in the two definitions of the Assumption and the Immaculate Conception can be said to be consonant with the teaching of the Scriptures and the ancient common traditions . But the report expressed concerns that the Roman Catholic dogmatic definitions of these concepts implies them to be " revealed by God " , stating : " The question arises for Anglicans , however , as to whether these doctrines concerning Mary are revealed by God in a way which must be held by believers as a matter of faith . "
In 1902 , the Siemens company developed a tantalum lamp filament . These lamps were more efficient than even graphitized carbon filaments and could operate at higher temperatures . Since tantalum metal has a lower resistivity than carbon , the tantalum lamp filament was quite long and required multiple internal supports . The metal filament had the property of gradually shortening in use ; the filaments were installed with large loops that tightened in use . This made lamps in use for several hundred hours quite fragile . Metal filaments had the property of breaking and re-welding , though this would usually decrease resistance and shorten the life of the filament . General Electric bought the rights to use tantalum filaments and produced them in the US until 1913 .
Besides emptiness , Mahayana schools often place emphasis on the notions of perfected spiritual insight ( prajñāpāramitā ) and Buddha-nature ( tathāgatagarbha ) . There are conflicting interpretations of the tathāgatagarbha in Mahāyāna thought . The idea may be traced to Abhidharma , and ultimately to statements of the Buddha in the Nikāyas . In Tibetan Buddhism , according to the Sakya school , tathāgatagarbha is the inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one 's mind . In Nyingma , tathāgatagarbha also generally refers to inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one 's mind . According to the Gelug school , it is the potential for sentient beings to awaken since they are empty ( i.e . dependently originated ) . According to the Jonang school , it refers to the innate qualities of the mind that expresses themselves as omniscience etc . when adventitious obscurations are removed . The " Tathāgatagarbha Sutras " are a collection of Mahayana sutras that present a unique model of Buddha-nature . Even though this collection was generally ignored in India , East Asian Buddhism provides some significance to these texts .
In the 2011–12 season , Arsenal celebrated their 125th year anniversary . The celebrations included a modified version of the current crest worn on their jerseys for the season . The crest was all white , surrounded by 15 oak leaves to the right and 15 laurel leaves to the left . The oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the Royal Oak pub . The 15 laurel leaves represent the design detail on the six pence pieces paid by the founding fathers to establish the club . The laurel leaves also represent strength . To complete the crest , 1886 and 2011 are shown on either sides of the motto " Forward " at the bottom of the crest .
The cartridge media of the console is officially referred to as Game Pak in most Western regions , and as Cassette ( カセット , Kasetto ? ) in Japan and parts of Latin America . While the SNES can address 128 Mbit , [ f ] only 117.75 Mbit are actually available for cartridge use . A fairly normal mapping could easily address up to 95 Mbit of ROM data ( 48 Mbit at FastROM speed ) with 8 Mbit of battery-backed RAM . However , most available memory access controllers only support mappings of up to 32 Mbit . The largest games released ( Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean ) contain 48 Mbit of ROM data , while the smallest games contain only 2 Mbit .
In the past 20 years , several commercial streets have been developed , hence the nightlife has become more diverse : there are shopping malls opening late in the Xinjiekou CBD and Hunan Road . The well-established " Nanjing 1912 " district hosts a wide variety of recreational facilities ranging from traditional restaurants and western pubs to dance clubs . There are two major areas where bars are densely located ; one is in 1912 block ; the other is along Shanghai road and its neighbourhood . Both are popular with international residents of the city .
The National Incident Based Reporting System ( NIBRS ) crime statistics system aims to address limitations inherent in UCR data . The system is used by law enforcement agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes . Local , state , and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their records management systems . Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense category . The Group A offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories . Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system . In addition to the Group A offenses , eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information . The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary-based UCR system . As of 2004 , 5,271 law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data . That amount represents 20 % of the United States population and 16 % of the crime statistics data collected by the FBI .
However , the NSA 's report was completely disproved by Croatian experts . The report failed to recognize that Tito was a native speaker of the very distinctive local Kajkavian dialect of Zagorje . The acute accent , present only in Croatian dialects , which Tito is perfectly pronouncing , is the strongest proof of Tito 's belonging to Kajkavian dialect .
Chopin has figured extensively in Polish literature , both in serious critical studies of his life and music and in fictional treatments . The earliest manifestation was probably an 1830 sonnet on Chopin by Leon Ulrich . French writers on Chopin ( apart from Sand ) have included Marcel Proust and André Gide ; and he has also featured in works of Gottfried Benn and Boris Pasternak . There are numerous biographies of Chopin in English ( see bibliography for some of these ) .
The innovative production techniques devised by post-punk producers such as Martin Hannett and Dennis Bovell during this period would become an important element of the emerging music , with studio experimentation taking a central role . A variety of groups that predated punk , such as Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle , experimented with crude production techniques and electronic instruments in tandem with performance art methods and influence from transgressive literature , ultimately helping to pioneer industrial music . Throbbing Gristle 's independent label Industrial Records would become a hub for this scene and provide it with its namesake .
The most important state-owned companies headquartered in Montevideo are : AFE ( railways ) , ANCAP ( Energy ) , Administracion Nacional de Puertos ( Ports ) , ANTEL ( telecommunications ) , BHU ( savings and loan ) , BROU ( bank ) , BSE ( insurance ) , OSE ( water & sewage ) , UTE ( electricity ) . These companies operate under public law , using a legal entity defined in the Uruguayan Constitution called Ente Autonomo ( " autonomous entity " ) . The government also owns part of other companies operating under private law , such as those owned wholly or partially by the CND ( National Development Corporation ) .
Concerning humanity as the image of Christ , English Dominican spirituality concentrated on the moral implications of image-bearing rather than the philosophical foundations of the imago Dei . The process of Christ 's life , and the process of image-bearing , amends humanity to God 's image . The idea of the " image of God " demonstrates both the ability of man to move toward God ( as partakers in Christ 's redeeming sacrifice ) , and that , on some level , man is always an image of God . As their love and knowledge of God grows and is sanctified by faith and experience , the image of God within man becomes ever more bright and clear .
Both Allen and Lambert released the coronation song , " No Boundaries " which was co-written by DioGuardi . This is the first season in which the winner failed to achieve gold album status , and none from that season achieved platinum album status in the U.S. [ citation needed ]
West 's third studio album , Graduation , garnered major publicity when its release date pitted West in a sales competition against rapper 50 Cent 's Curtis . Upon their September 2007 releases , Graduation outsold Curtis by a large margin , debuting at number one on the U.S . Billboard 200 chart and selling 957,000 copies in its first week . Graduation once again continued the string of critical and commercial successes by West , and the album 's lead single , " Stronger " , garnered the rapper his third number-one hit . " Stronger " , which samples French house duo Daft Punk , has been accredited to not only encouraging other hip-hop artists to incorporate house and electronica elements into their music , but also for playing a part in the revival of disco and electro-infused music in the late 2000s . Ben Detrick of XXL cited the outcome of the sales competition between 50 Cent 's Curtis and West 's Graduation as being responsible for altering the direction of hip-hop and paving the way for new rappers who did n't follow the hardcore-gangster mold , writing , " If there was ever a watershed moment to indicate hip-hop 's changing direction , it may have come when 50 Cent competed with Kanye in 2007 to see whose album would claim superior sales . "
During adolescence , the human body undergoes various physical , physiological and immunological changes triggered and mediated by hormones , of which the most significant in females is 17-β-oestradiol ( an oestrogen ) and , in males , is testosterone . Oestradiol usually begins to act around the age of 10 and testosterone some months later . There is evidence that these steroids act directly not only on the primary and secondary sexual characteristics but also have an effect on the development and regulation of the immune system , including an increased risk in developing pubescent and post-pubescent autoimmunity . There is also some evidence that cell surface receptors on B cells and macrophages may detect sex hormones in the system .
In 1915 , as the Russian Caucasus Army continued to advance into eastern Anatolia , the Ottoman government started the deportation of its ethnic Armenian population , resulting in the death of approximately 1.5 million Armenians in what became known as the Armenian Genocide . The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases : the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour , followed by the deportation of women , children , the elderly and infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert . Driven forward by military escorts , the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery , rape , and systematic massacre . Large-scale massacres were also committed against the Empire 's Greek and Assyrian minorities as part of the same campaign of ethnic cleansing .
Towards the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s , producers such as Daft Punk , Stardust , Cassius , St. Germain and DJ Falcon began producing a new sound out of Paris 's house scene . Together , they laid the groundwork for what would be known as the French house movement . By combining the harder-edged-yet-soulful philosophy of Chicago house with the melodies of obscure funk , state-of-the-art production techniques and the sound of analog synthesizers , they began to create the standards that would shape all house music .
A recent addition to the exhibition is the late 13th-century Westminster Retable , England 's oldest altarpiece , which was most probably designed for the high altar of the abbey . Although it has been damaged in past centuries , the panel has been expertly cleaned and conserved .
Karl Marx published the Communist Manifesto in February 1848 , with little attention . However , a few days later the French Revolution of 1848 broke out , which replaced the monarchy of Louis Philippe with the Second French Republic . In June 1848 , Paris workers , disenchanted with the new government , built barricades and raised red flags . The new government called in the French Army to put down the uprising , the first of many such confrontations between the army and the new worker 's movements in Europe .
As the number and size of agricultural societies increased , they expanded into lands traditionally used by hunter-gatherers . This process of agriculture-driven expansion led to the development of the first forms of government in agricultural centers , such as the Fertile Crescent , Ancient India , Ancient China , Olmec , Sub-Saharan Africa and Norte Chico .
The list of nutrients that people are known to require is , in the words of Marion Nestle , " almost certainly incomplete " . As of 2014 , nutrients are thought to be of two types : macro-nutrients which are needed in relatively large amounts , and micronutrients which are needed in smaller quantities . A type of carbohydrate , dietary fiber , i.e . non-digestible material such as cellulose , is required , for both mechanical and biochemical reasons , although the exact reasons remain unclear . Other micronutrients include antioxidants and phytochemicals , which are said to influence ( or protect ) some body systems . Their necessity is not as well established as in the case of , for instance , vitamins .
Archaeologists excavating near the city have unearthed Iron Age sites that may date from 500 BCE . The region comprising modern Hyderabad and its surroundings was known as Golkonda ( Golla Konda- " shepherd 's hill " ) , and was ruled by the Chalukya dynasty from 624 CE to 1075 CE . Following the dissolution of the Chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century , Golkonda came under the control of the Kakatiya dynasty from 1158 , whose seat of power was at Warangal , 148 km ( 92 mi ) northeast of modern Hyderabad .
This contrasts with the presidential system , in which the president ( or equivalent ) is both the head of state and the head of the government . In some presidential or semi-presidential systems , such as those of France , Russia or South Korea , the prime minister is an official generally appointed by the president but usually approved by the legislature and responsible for carrying out the directives of the president and managing the civil service . The head of government of the People 's Republic of China is referred to as the Premier of the State Council and the premier of the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) is also appointed by the president , but requires no approval by the legislature .
Chopin 's relations with Sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter Solange and Solange 's fiancé , the young fortune-hunting sculptor Auguste Clésinger . The composer frequently took Solange 's side in quarrels with her mother ; he also faced jealousy from Sand 's son Maurice . Chopin was utterly indifferent to Sand 's radical political pursuits , while Sand looked on his society friends with disdain . As the composer 's illness progressed , Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin , whom she called her " third child " . In letters to third parties , she vented her impatience , referring to him as a " child , " a " little angel " , a " sufferer " and a " beloved little corpse . " In 1847 Sand published her novel Lucrezia Floriani , whose main characters—a rich actress and a prince in weak health—could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin ; the story was uncomplimentary to Chopin , who could not have missed the allusions as he helped Sand correct the printer 's galleys . In 1847 he did not visit Nohant , and he quietly ended their ten-year relationship following an angry correspondence which , in Sand 's words , made " a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship . " The two would never meet again .
The university employs 3,401 full-time faculty members across its eleven schools , including 18 members of the National Academy of Sciences , 65 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , 19 members of the National Academy of Engineering , and 6 members of the Institute of Medicine .

On 25 January 1952 , a confrontation between British forces and police at Ismailia resulted in the deaths of 40 Egyptian policemen , provoking riots in Cairo the next day which left 76 people dead . Afterwards , Nasser published a simple six-point program in Rose al-Yūsuf to dismantle feudalism and British influence in Egypt . In May , Nasser received word that Farouk knew the names of the Free Officers and intended to arrest them ; he immediately entrusted Free Officer Zakaria Mohieddin with the task of planning the government takeover by army units loyal to the association .
Following the events in Olympia , there were reports that China requested permission to deploy People 's Liberation Army personnel along the relay route to protect the flame in Canberra . Australian authorities stated that such a request , if it were to be made , would be refused . Chinese officials labeled it a rumor . Australian police have been given powers to search relay spectators , following a call by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association for Chinese Australian students to " go defend our sacred torch " against " ethnic degenerate scum and anti-China separatists " . Tony Goh , chairman of the Australian Council of Chinese Organisations , has said the ACCO would be taking " thousands " of pro-Beijing demonstrators to Canberra by bus , to support the torch relay . Zhang Rongan , a Chinese Australian student organising pro-Beijing demonstrations , told the press that Chinese diplomats were assisting with the organization of buses , meals and accommodation for pro-Beijing demonstrators , and helping them organise a " peaceful show of strength " . Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said Chinese officials were urging supporters to " turn up and put a point of view " , but that he had no objection to it as long as they remained peaceful .
Ganondorf then revives , and Midna teleports Link and Zelda outside the castle so she can hold him off with the Fused Shadows . However , as Hyrule Castle collapses , it is revealed that Ganondorf was victorious as he crushes Midna 's helmet . Ganondorf engages Link on horseback , and , assisted by Zelda and the Light Spirits , Link eventually knocks Ganondorf off his horse and they duel on foot before Link strikes down Ganondorf and plunges the Master Sword into his chest . With Ganondorf dead , the Light Spirits not only bring Midna back to life , but restore her to her true form . After bidding farewell to Link and Zelda , Midna returns home before destroying the Mirror of Twilight with a tear to maintain balance between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm . Near the end , as Hyrule Castle is rebuilt , Link is shown leaving Ordon Village heading to parts unknown .
Frustrated by the wasted effort , and with demands for action from their citizens , the allied force decided to attack the center of Russian strength in the Black Sea at Sevastopol on the Crimean peninsula . After extended preparations , the forces landed on the peninsula in September 1854 and fought their way to a point south of Sevastopol after a series of successful battles . The Russians counterattacked on 25 October in what became the Battle of Balaclava and were repulsed , but at the cost of seriously depleting the British Army forces . A second counterattack , ordered personally by Nicholas , was defeated by Omar Pasha . The front settled into a siege and led to horrible conditions for troops on both sides . Smaller actions were carried out in the Baltic , the Caucasus , the White Sea and in the North Pacific .
As noted in the introduction to this article , the American public has maintained its position of support for capital punishment for murder . However , when given a choice between the death penalty and life imprisonment without parole , support has traditionally been significantly lower than polling which has only mentioned the death penalty as a punishment . In 2010 , for instance , one poll showed 49 percent favoring the death penalty and 46 percent favoring life imprisonment while in another 61 % said they preferred another punishment to the death penalty . The highest level of support for the death penalty recorded overall was 80 percent in 1994 ( 16 percent opposed ) , and the lowest recorded was 42 percent in 1966 ( 47 percent opposed ) . On the question of the death penalty vs. life without parole , the strongest preference for the death penalty was 61 percent in 1997 ( 29 percent favoring life ) , and the lowest preference for the death penalty was 47 percent in 2006 ( 48 percent favoring life ) .
There are many notable contributors to the field of Chinese science throughout the ages . One of the best examples would be Shen Kuo ( 1031–1095 ) , a polymath scientist and statesman who was the first to describe the magnetic-needle compass used for navigation , discovered the concept of true north , improved the design of the astronomical gnomon , armillary sphere , sight tube , and clepsydra , and described the use of drydocks to repair boats . After observing the natural process of the inundation of silt and the find of marine fossils in the Taihang Mountains ( hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean ) , Shen Kuo devised a theory of land formation , or geomorphology . He also adopted a theory of gradual climate change in regions over time , after observing petrified bamboo found underground at Yan'an , Shaanxi province . If not for Shen Kuo 's writing , the architectural works of Yu Hao would be little known , along with the inventor of movable type printing , Bi Sheng ( 990-1051 ) . Shen 's contemporary Su Song ( 1020–1101 ) was also a brilliant polymath , an astronomer who created a celestial atlas of star maps , wrote a pharmaceutical treatise with related subjects of botany , zoology , mineralogy , and metallurgy , and had erected a large astronomical clocktower in Kaifeng city in 1088 . To operate the crowning armillary sphere , his clocktower featured an escapement mechanism and the world 's oldest known use of an endless power-transmitting chain drive .
Much of the Great Plains became open range , or rangeland where cattle roamed free , hosting ranching operations where anyone was theoretically free to run cattle . In the spring and fall , ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves , treated animals and sorted the cattle for sale . Such ranching began in Texas and gradually moved northward . In 1866-95 , cowboys herded 10 million cattle north to rail heads such as Dodge City , Kansas and Ogallala , Nebraska ; from there , cattle were shipped eastward .
With 120,000 students in London , the federal University of London is the largest contact teaching university in the UK . It includes four large multi-faculty universities – King 's College London , Queen Mary , Royal Holloway and UCL – and a number of smaller and more specialised institutions including Birkbeck , the Courtauld Institute of Art , Goldsmiths , Guildhall School of Music and Drama , the Institute of Education , the London Business School , the London School of Economics , the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine , the Royal Academy of Music , the Central School of Speech and Drama , the Royal Veterinary College and the School of Oriental and African Studies . Members of the University of London have their own admissions procedures , and some award their own degrees .
The maximum energy is a function of dielectric volume , permittivity , and dielectric strength . Changing the plate area and the separation between the plates while maintaining the same volume causes no change of the maximum amount of energy that the capacitor can store , so long as the distance between plates remains much smaller than both the length and width of the plates . In addition , these equations assume that the electric field is entirely concentrated in the dielectric between the plates . In reality there are fringing fields outside the dielectric , for example between the sides of the capacitor plates , which will increase the effective capacitance of the capacitor . This is sometimes called parasitic capacitance . For some simple capacitor geometries this additional capacitance term can be calculated analytically . It becomes negligibly small when the ratios of plate width to separation and length to separation are large .
Primary resistance occurs when a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB . A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary ( acquired ) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment , not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately ( lack of compliance ) , or using low-quality medication . Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries , as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs . MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs : rifampicin and isoniazid . Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs . Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs . It was first observed in 2003 in Italy , but not widely reported until 2012 , and has also been found in Iran and India . Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB .
These different explorations of 'identity ' demonstrate how difficult a concept it is to pin down . Since identity is a virtual thing , it is impossible to define it empirically . Discussions of identity use the term with different meanings , from fundamental and abiding sameness , to fluidity , contingency , negotiated and so on . Brubaker and Cooper note a tendency in many scholars to confuse identity as a category of practice and as a category of analysis ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 5 ) . Indeed , many scholars demonstrate a tendency to follow their own preconceptions of identity , following more or less the frameworks listed above , rather than taking into account the mechanisms by which the concept is crystallised as reality . In this environment , some analysts , such as Brubaker and Cooper , have suggested doing away with the concept completely ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 1 ) . Others , by contrast , have sought to introduce alternative concepts in an attempt to capture the dynamic and fluid qualities of human social self-expression . Hall ( 1992 , 1996 ) , for example , suggests treating identity as a process , to take into account the reality of diverse and ever-changing social experience . Some scholars have introduced the idea of identification , whereby identity is perceived as made up of different components that are 'identified ' and interpreted by individuals . The construction of an individual sense of self is achieved by personal choices regarding who and what to associate with . Such approaches are liberating in their recognition of the role of the individual in social interaction and the construction of identity .
The rebel barons responded by inviting the French prince Louis to lead them : Louis had a claim to the English throne by virtue of his marriage to Blanche of Castile , a granddaughter of Henry II . Philip may have provided him with private support but refused to openly support Louis , who was excommunicated by Innocent for taking part in the war against John . Louis ' planned arrival in England presented a significant problem for John , as the prince would bring with him naval vessels and siege engines essential to the rebel cause . Once John contained Alexander in Scotland , he marched south to deal with the challenge of the coming invasion .
During the rule of the succeeding Hanoverian dynasty , power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government . The first Hanoverian monarch , George I , relied on his ministers to a greater extent than did previous monarchs . Later Hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation : George III and George IV both openly opposed Catholic Emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a Catholic emancipation bill would violate the Coronation Oath , which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established Church of England from Papal domination and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy . However , George IV reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers . Thus , as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved , the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse , both in the United Kingdom and in the other Commonwealth realms .
Agriculture and horticulture seek to optimize the capture of solar energy in order to optimize the productivity of plants . Techniques such as timed planting cycles , tailored row orientation , staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields . While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource , the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture . During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age , French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy . These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm . Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south , but over time , sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight . In 1699 , Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun . Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water , drying crops , brooding chicks and drying chicken manure . More recently the technology has been embraced by vinters , who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses .
Barça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey Final , winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time . A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became La Liga champions for the 2008–09 season . Barça finished the season by beating the previous year 's Champions League winners Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome to win their third Champions League title and completed the first ever treble won by a Spanish team . The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk , becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble . In December 2009 , Barcelona won the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup , and became the first football club ever to accomplish the sextuple . Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Spanish Super Cup trophy for a ninth time .
Over 50 % of undergraduate students live on campus . Most of the residence halls on campus are located on the South 40 , named because of its adjacent location on the south side of the Danforth Campus and its size of 40 acres ( 160,000 m2 ) . It is the location of all the freshman buildings as well as several upperclassman buildings , which are set up in the traditional residential college system . All of the residential halls are co-ed . The South 40 is organized as a pedestrian-friendly environment wherein residences surround a central recreational lawn known as the Swamp . Bear 's Den ( the largest dining hall on campus ) , the Habif Health and Wellness Center ( Student Health Services ) , the Residential Life Office , University Police Headquarters , various student-owned businesses ( e.g . the laundry service , Wash U Wash ) , and the baseball , softball , and intramural fields are also located on the South 40 .
Because of the low elevation , the islands that make up this nation are vulnerable to the effects of tropical cyclones and by the threat of current and future sea level rise . The highest elevation is 4.6 metres ( 15 ft ) above sea level on Niulakita , which gives Tuvalu the second-lowest maximum elevation of any country ( after the Maldives ) . The highest elevations are typically in narrow storm dunes on the ocean side of the islands which are prone to overtopping in tropical cyclones , as occurred with Cyclone Bebe , which was a very early-season storm that passed through the Tuvaluan atolls in October 1972 . Cyclone Bebe submerged Funafuti , eliminating 90 % of structures on the island . Sources of drinking water were contaminated as a result of the system 's storm surge and the flooding of the sources of fresh water .
It is the third language of South Africa in terms of native speakers ( ~13.5 % ) , of whom 53 percent are Coloureds and 42.4 percent Whites . In 1996 , 40 percent of South Africans reported to know Afrikaans at least at a very basic level of communication . It is the lingua franca in Namibia , where it is spoken natively in 11 percent of households . In total , Afrikaans is the first language in South Africa alone of about 6.8 million people and is estimated to be a second language for at least 10 million people worldwide , compared to over 23 million and 5 million respectively , for Dutch .
Von Neumann was born Neumann János Lajos ( in Hungarian the family name comes first ) , Hebrew name Yonah , in Budapest , Kingdom of Hungary , which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , to wealthy Jewish parents of the Haskalah . He was the eldest of three children . He had two younger brothers : Michael , born in 1907 , and Nicholas , who was born in 1911 . His father , Neumann Miksa ( Max Neumann ) was a banker , who held a doctorate in law . He had moved to Budapest from Pécs at the end of the 1880s . Miksa 's father and grandfather were both born in Ond ( now part of the town of Szerencs ) , Zemplén County , northern Hungary . John 's mother was Kann Margit ( Margaret Kann ) ; her parents were Jakab Kann and Katalin Meisels . Three generations of the Kann family lived in spacious apartments above the Kann-Heller offices in Budapest ; von Neumann 's family occupied an 18-room apartment on the top floor .
Walking is a popular recreational activity in London . Areas that provide for walks include Wimbledon Common , Epping Forest , Hampton Court Park , Hampstead Heath , the eight Royal Parks , canals and disused railway tracks . Access to canals and rivers has improved recently , including the creation of the Thames Path , some 28 miles ( 45 km ) of which is within Greater London , and The Wandle Trail ; this runs 12 miles ( 19 km ) through South London along the River Wandle , a tributary of the River Thames . Other long distance paths , linking green spaces , have also been created , including the Capital Ring , the Green Chain Walk , London Outer Orbital Path ( " Loop " ) , Jubilee Walkway , Lea Valley Walk , and the Diana , Princess of Wales Memorial Walk .
Boston ( pronounced i/ˈbɒstən/ ) is the capital and largest city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States . Boston also served as the historic county seat of Suffolk County until Massachusetts disbanded county government in 1999 . The city proper covers 48 square miles ( 124 km2 ) with an estimated population of 655,884 in 2014 , making it the largest city in New England and the 24th largest city in the United States . The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area called Greater Boston , home to 4.7 million people and the tenth-largest metropolitan statistical area in the country . Greater Boston as a commuting region is home to 8.1 million people , making it the sixth-largest combined statistical area in the United States .
Victoria 's youngest son , Leopold , was affected by the blood-clotting disease haemophilia B and two of her five daughters , Alice and Beatrice , were carriers . Royal haemophiliacs descended from Victoria included her great-grandsons , Tsarevich Alexei of Russia , Alfonso , Prince of Asturias , and Infante Gonzalo of Spain . The presence of the disease in Victoria 's descendants , but not in her ancestors , led to modern speculation that her true father was not the Duke of Kent but a haemophiliac . There is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with Victoria 's mother , and as male carriers always suffer the disease , even if such a man had existed he would have been seriously ill . It is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because Victoria 's father was over 50 at the time of her conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers . Spontaneous mutations account for about a third of cases .
The elaboration of the cerebral cortex carries with it changes to other brain areas . The superior colliculus , which plays a major role in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates , shrinks to a small size in mammals , and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex . The cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion ( the neocerebellum ) dedicated to supporting the cerebral cortex , which has no counterpart in other vertebrates .
An individual wrestler may sometimes use their real name , or a minor variation of it , for much of their career , such as Angelo Poffo , Ernie Ladd , Verne Gagne , Bret Hart , and Randy Orton . Others can keep one ring name for their entire career ( cases in point include Chris Jericho , Shawn Michaels , CM Punk and Ricky Steamboat ) , or may change from time to time to better suit the demands of the audience or company . Sometimes a character is owned and trademarked by the company , forcing the wrestler to find a new one when they leave ( although a simple typeset change , such as changing Rhyno to Rhino , can usually get around this ) , and sometimes a character is owned by the wrestler . Sometimes , a wrestler may change their legal name in order to obtain ownership of their ring name ( examples include Andrew Martin and Warrior ) . Many wrestlers ( such as The Rock and The Undertaker ) are strongly identified with their character , even responding to the name in public or between friends . It 's actually considered proper decorum for fellow wrestlers to refer to each other by their stage names/characters rather than their birth/legal names , unless otherwise introduced . A professional wrestling character 's popularity can grow to the point that it makes appearances in other media ( see Hulk Hogan and El Santo ) or even give the performer enough visibility to enter politics ( Antonio Inoki and Jesse Ventura , among others ) .
Although it had equipment capable of doing serious damage , the problem for the Luftwaffe was its unclear strategy and poor intelligence . OKL had not been informed that Britain was to be considered a potential opponent until early 1938 . It had no time to gather reliable intelligence on Britain 's industries . Moreover , OKL could not settle on an appropriate strategy . German planners had to decide whether the Luftwaffe should deliver the weight of its attacks against a specific segment of British industry such as aircraft factories , or against a system of interrelated industries such as Britain 's import and distribution network , or even in a blow aimed at breaking the morale of the British population . The Luftwaffe 's strategy became increasingly aimless over the winter of 1940–1941 . Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy . This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it began .
By synchronously resetting all clocks in a region to one hour ahead of Standard Time ( one hour " fast " ) , individuals who follow such a year-round schedule will wake an hour earlier than they would have otherwise ; they will begin and complete daily work routines an hour earlier , and they will have available to them an extra hour of daylight after their workday activities . However , they will have one less hour of daylight at the start of each day , making the policy less practical during winter .
Materialism is a form of philosophical monism which holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature , and that all phenomena , including mental phenomena and consciousness , are identical with material interactions .
The language of the Quran has been described as " rhymed prose " as it partakes of both poetry and prose ; however , this description runs the risk of failing to convey the rhythmic quality of Quranic language , which is more poetic in some parts and more prose-like in others . Rhyme , while found throughout the Quran , is conspicuous in many of the earlier Meccan suras , in which relatively short verses throw the rhyming words into prominence . The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81 , and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers . Frequently a change of rhyme from one set of verses to another signals a change in the subject of discussion . Later sections also preserve this form but the style is more expository .
The music hall and cabaret are famous Paris institutions . The Moulin Rouge was opened in 1889 . It was highly visible because of its large red imitation windmill on its roof , and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan . It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec , who made posters for the venue . In 1911 , the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows , competing with its great rival , the Folies Bergère , Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker . The Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers , including Mistinguett , Maurice Chevalier , and Tino Rossi . Other famous Paris music halls include Le Lido , on the Champs-Élysées , opened in 1946 ; and the Crazy Horse Saloon , featuring strip-tease , dance and magic , opened in 1951 . The Olympia Paris has presented Edith Piaf , Marlene Dietrich , Miles Davis , Judy Garland , and the Grateful Dead . A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris , attended mostly visitors to the city .
Although the city lost the status of state capital to Columbia in 1786 , Charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-Revolutionary years . The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop , making short-staple cotton profitable . It was more easily grown in the upland areas , and cotton quickly became South Carolina 's major export commodity . The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations , to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted . Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city , working as domestics , artisans , market workers , and laborers .
Archaeological discovery shows that " Nanjing Man " lived in more than 500 thousand years ago . Zun , a kind of wine vessel , was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago . In the late period of Shang dynasty , Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state , and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture . According to legend , [ which ? ] Fuchai , King of the State of Wu , founded a fort named Yecheng ( 冶城 ) in today 's Nanjing area in 495 BC . Later in 473 BC , the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng ( 越城 ) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate . In 333 BC , after eliminating the State of Yue , the State of Chu built Jinling Yi ( 金陵邑 ) in the western part of present-day Nanjing . It was renamed Moling ( 秣陵 ) during reign of Qin Shi Huang . Since then , the city experienced destruction and renewal many times . [ citation needed ] The area was successively part of Kuaiji , Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty , and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation 's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty ( 106 BC ) . Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture , and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang .
Species that have no long-distance migratory relatives , such as the waxwings Bombycilla , are effectively moving in response to winter weather and the loss of their usual winter food , rather than enhanced breeding opportunities .
Machine vision systems often require bright and homogeneous illumination , so features of interest are easier to process . LEDs are often used for this purpose , and this is likely to remain one of their major uses until the price drops low enough to make signaling and illumination uses more widespread . Barcode scanners are the most common example of machine vision , and many low cost products use red LEDs instead of lasers . Optical computer mice are an example of LEDs in machine vision , as it is used to provide an even light source on the surface for the miniature camera within the mouse . LEDs constitute a nearly ideal light source for machine vision systems for several reasons :
The experience of pain has many cultural dimensions . For instance , the way in which one experiences and responds to pain is related to sociocultural characteristics , such as gender , ethnicity , and age . An aging adult may not respond to pain in the way that a younger person would . Their ability to recognize pain may be blunted by illness or the use of multiple prescription drugs . Depression may also keep the older adult from reporting they are in pain . The older adult may also quit doing activities they love because it hurts too much . Decline in self-care activities ( dressing , grooming , walking , etc . ) may also be indicators that the older adult is experiencing pain . The older adult may refrain from reporting pain because they are afraid they will have to have surgery or will be put on a drug they might become addicted to . They may not want others to see them as weak , or may feel there is something impolite or shameful in complaining about pain , or they may feel the pain is deserved punishment for past transgressions .
An example of this theory in action would be as follows : An emotion-evoking stimulus ( snake ) triggers a pattern of physiological response ( increased heart rate , faster breathing , etc . ) , which is interpreted as a particular emotion ( fear ) . This theory is supported by experiments in which by manipulating the bodily state induces a desired emotional state . Some people may believe that emotions give rise to emotion-specific actions : e.g . " I 'm crying because I 'm sad , " or " I ran away because I was scared . " The issue with the James–Lange theory is that of causation ( bodily states causing emotions and being a priori ) , not that of the bodily influences on emotional experience ( which can be argued and is still quite prevalent today in biofeedback studies and embodiment theory ) .
From its base in India , the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s . This trade , illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729 , helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea , which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China . In 1839 , the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War , and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island , at that time a minor settlement .
More than 12,000 miles ( 19,000 km ) of roads make up the state 's major highway skeleton , including state-operated highways , ten turnpikes or major toll roads , and the longest drivable stretch of Route 66 in the nation . In 2008 , Interstate 44 in Oklahoma City was Oklahoma 's busiest highway , with a daily traffic volume of 123,300 cars . In 2010 , the state had the nation 's third highest number of bridges classified as structurally deficient , with nearly 5,212 bridges in disrepair , including 235 National Highway System Bridges .
Anxious to expand the company 's broadcast and cable presence , longtime MCA head Lew Wasserman sought a rich partner . He located Japanese electronics manufacturer Matsushita Electric ( now known as Panasonic ) , which agreed to acquire MCA for $ 6.6 billion in 1990 . Meanwhile , around this time , the production subsidiary was renamed Universal Studios Inc. , and ( in 1990 ) MCA created MCA/Universal Home Video Inc. for the VHS video cassette ( later DVD ) sales industry .
The structure known as " Virgil 's tomb " is found at the entrance of an ancient Roman tunnel ( also known as " grotta vecchia " ) in Piedigrotta , a district two miles from the centre of Naples , near the Mergellina harbor , on the road heading north along the coast to Pozzuoli . While Virgil was already the object of literary admiration and veneration before his death , in the Middle Ages his name became associated with miraculous powers , and for a couple of centuries his tomb was the destination of pilgrimages and veneration .
West , alongside his mother , founded the " Kanye West Foundation " in Chicago in 2003 , tasked with a mission to battle dropout and illiteracy rates , while partnering with community organizations to provide underprivileged youth access to music education . In 2007 , the West and the Foundation partnered with Strong American Schools as part of their " Ed in '08 " campaign . As spokesman for the campaign , West appeared in a series of PSAs for the organization , and hosted an inaugural benefit concert in August of that year .
Quoted at constant 2002 prices , GDP fell from £12 million in 1999-2000 to £11 million in 2005-06 . Imports are mainly from the UK and South Africa and amounted to £6.4 million in 2004-05 ( quoted on an FOB basis ) . Exports are much smaller , amounting to £0.2 million in 2004-05 . Exports are mainly fish and coffee ; Philatelic sales were £0.06 million in 2004-05 . The limited number of visiting tourists spent about £0.4 million in 2004-05 , representing a contribution to GDP of 3 % .
The name Thuringia or Thüringen derives from the Germanic tribe Thuringii , who emerged during the Migration Period . Their origin is not completely known . An older theory claimed that they were successors of the Hermunduri , but later research rejected the idea . Other historians argue that the Thuringians were allies of the Huns , came to central Europe together with them , and lived before in what is Galicia today . Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus first mentioned the Thuringii around 400 ; during that period , the Thuringii were famous for their excellent horses .
Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter ( /biːˈjɒnseɪ/ bee-YON-say ) ( born September 4 , 1981 ) is an American singer , songwriter , record producer and actress . Born and raised in Houston , Texas , she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child , and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R & B girl-group Destiny 's Child . Managed by her father , Mathew Knowles , the group became one of the world 's best-selling girl groups of all time . Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé 's debut album , Dangerously in Love ( 2003 ) , which established her as a solo artist worldwide , earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles " Crazy in Love " and " Baby Boy " .
This changed with the recent sovereign-debt crisis . The ECB always could , and through the late summer of 2011 did , purchase bonds issued by the weaker states even though it assumes , in doing so , the risk of a deteriorating balance sheet . ECB buying focused primarily on Spanish and Italian debt . Certain techniques can minimise the impact . Purchases of Italian bonds by the central bank , for example , were intended to dampen international speculation and strengthen portfolios in the private sector and also the central bank .
Beyoncé and husband Jay Z are friends with President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama . She performed " America the Beautiful " at the 2009 presidential inauguration , as well as " At Last " during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later . Beyoncé and Jay Z held a fundraiser at the latter 's 40/40 Club in Manhattan for Obama 's 2012 presidential campaign which raised $ 4 million . Beyoncé uploaded pictures of her paper ballot on Tumblr , confirming she had voted in support for the Democratic Party and to encourage others to do so . She also performed the American national anthem at his second inauguration , singing along with a pre-recorded track . She publicly endorsed same sex marriage on March 26 , 2013 , after the Supreme Court debate on California 's Proposition 8 . In July 2013 , Beyoncé and Jay-Z attended a rally in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting of Trayvon Martin .
Chopin 's tombstone , featuring the muse of music , Euterpe , weeping over a broken lyre , was designed and sculpted by Clésinger . The expenses of the funeral and monument , amounting to 5,000 francs , were covered by Jane Stirling , who also paid for the return of the composer 's sister Ludwika to Warsaw . Ludwika took Chopin 's heart in an urn , preserved in alcohol , back to Poland in 1850 . [ n 9 ] She also took a collection of two hundred letters from Sand to Chopin ; after 1851 these were returned to Sand , who seems to have destroyed them .
On July 1 , 1988 , the fourth and last day of a bruising 19th Party Conference , Gorbachev won the backing of the tired delegates for his last-minute proposal to create a new supreme legislative body called the Congress of People 's Deputies . Frustrated by the old guard 's resistance , Gorbachev embarked on a set of constitutional changes to try to separate party and state , and thereby isolate his conservative Party opponents . Detailed proposals for the new Congress of People 's Deputies were published on October 2 , 1988 , and to enable the creation of the new legislature the Supreme Soviet , during its November 29–December 1 , 1988 , session , implemented amendments to the 1977 Soviet Constitution , enacted a law on electoral reform , and set the date of the election for March 26 , 1989 .
From the 2011 Census , the Office for National Statistics published that Plymouth 's unitary authority area population was 256,384 ; 15,664 more people than that of the last census from 2001 , which indicated that Plymouth had a population of 240,720 . The Plymouth urban area had a population of 260,203 in 2011 ( the urban sprawl which extends outside the authority 's boundaries ) . The city 's average household size was 2.3 persons . At the time of the 2011 UK census , the ethnic composition of Plymouth 's population was 96.2 % White ( of 92.9 % was White British ) , with the largest minority ethnic group being Chinese at 0.5 % . The white Irish ethnic group saw the largest decline in its share of the population since the 2001 Census ( -24 % ) , while the Other Asian and Black African had the largest increases ( 360 % and 351 % respectively ) . This excludes the two new ethnic groups added to the 2011 census of Gypsy or Irish Traveller and Arab . The population rose rapidly during the second half of the 19th century , but declined by over 1.6 % from 1931 to 1951 .
Traditionally the Rajputs , Jats , Meenas , Gurjars , Bhils , Rajpurohit , Charans , Yadavs , Bishnois , Sermals , PhulMali ( Saini ) and other tribes made a great contribution in building the state of Rajasthan . All these tribes suffered great difficulties in protecting their culture and the land . Millions of them were killed trying to protect their land . A number of Gurjars had been exterminated in Bhinmal and Ajmer areas fighting with the invaders . Bhils once ruled Kota . Meenas were rulers of Bundi and the Dhundhar region .
In China , a call to boycott French hypermart Carrefour from May 1 began spreading through mobile text messaging and online chat rooms amongst the Chinese over the weekend from April 12 , accusing the company 's major shareholder , the LVMH Group , of donating funds to the Dalai Lama . There were also calls to extend the boycott to include French luxury goods and cosmetic products . Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming , Hefei and Wuhan , accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism . Some burned French flags , some added Swastika ( due to its conotaions with Nazism ) to the French flag , and spread short online messages calling for large protests in front of French consulates and embassy . Some shoppers who insisted on entering one of the Carrefour stores in Kunming were blocked by boycotters wielding large Chinese flags and hit by water bottles . Hundreds of people joined Anti-French rallies in Beijing , Wuhan , Hefei , Kunming and Qingdao , which quickly spread to other cities like Xi'an , Harbin and Jinan . Carrefour denied any support or involvement in the Tibetan issue , and had its staff in its Chinese stores wear uniforms emblazoned with the Chinese national flag and caps with Olympic insignia and as well as the words " Beijing 2008 " to show its support for the games . The effort had to be ceased when the BOCOG deemed the use of official Olympic insignia as illegal and a violation of copyright .
The British recognised the need for anti-aircraft capability a few weeks before World War I broke out ; on 8 July 1914 , the New York Times reported that the British government had decided to 'dot the coasts of the British Isles with a series of towers , each armed with two quick-firing guns of special design , ' while 'a complete circle of towers ' was to be built around 'naval installations ' and 'at other especially vulnerable points . ' By December 1914 the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve ( RNVR ) was manning AA guns and searchlights assembled from various sources at some nine ports . The Royal Garrison Artillery ( RGA ) was given responsibility for AA defence in the field , using motorised two-gun sections . The first were formally formed in November 1914 . Initially they used QF 1-pounder " pom-pom " ( a 37 mm version of the Maxim Gun ) .
Michel Djotodia took over as president and in May 2013 Central African Republic 's Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye requested a UN peacekeeping force from the UN Security Council and on 31 May former President Bozizé was indicted for crimes against humanity and incitement of genocide . The security situation did not improve during June–August 2013 and there were reports of over 200,000 internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) as well as human rights abuses and renewed fighting between Séléka and Bozizé supporters .
It was announced on December 12 , 2012 , that the AFL reached a partnership agreement with NET10 Wireless to be the first non-motorsports-related professional sports league in the United States to have a title sponsor , renaming it the NET10 Wireless Arena Football League . The redesigned website showed the new logo which incorporated the current AFL logo with the one from NET10 Wireless . The title sponsorship agreement ended in 2014 after a two-year partnership .
The Swazi economy is very closely linked to the economy of South Africa , from which it receives over 90 % of its imports and to which it sends about 70 % of its exports . Swaziland 's other key trading partners are the United States and the EU , from whom the country has received trade preferences for apparel exports ( under the African Growth and Opportunity Act – AGOA – to the US ) and for sugar ( to the EU ) . Under these agreements , both apparel and sugar exports did well , with rapid growth and a strong inflow of foreign direct investment . Textile exports grew by over 200 % between 2000 and 2005 and sugar exports increasing by more than 50 % over the same period .
In its metaphysics , Nyāya school is closer to the Vaiśeṣika school than others . It holds that human suffering results from mistakes/defects produced by activity under wrong knowledge ( notions and ignorance ) . Moksha ( liberation ) , it states , is gained through right knowledge . This premise led Nyāya to concern itself with epistemology , that is the reliable means to gain correct knowledge and to remove wrong notions . False knowledge is not merely ignorance to Naiyayikas , it includes delusion . Correct knowledge is discovering and overcoming one 's delusions , and understanding true nature of soul , self and reality . The Nyāya Sūtras begin :
Coordination strategies differ when adjacent time zones shift clocks . The European Union shifts all at once , at 01:00 UTC or 02:00 CET or 03:00 EET ; for example , Eastern European Time is always one hour ahead of Central European Time . Most of North America shifts at 02:00 local time , so its zones do not shift at the same time ; for example , Mountain Time is temporarily ( for one hour ) zero hours ahead of Pacific Time , instead of one hour ahead , in the autumn and two hours , instead of one , ahead of Pacific Time in the spring . In the past , Australian districts went even further and did not always agree on start and end dates ; for example , in 2008 most DST-observing areas shifted clocks forward on October 5 but Western Australia shifted on October 26 . In some cases only part of a country shifts ; for example , in the US , Hawaii and most of Arizona do not observe DST .
In 712 , Arab Muslim general Muhammad bin Qasim conquered most of the Indus region in modern-day Pakistan for the Umayyad Empire , incorporating it as the " As-Sindh " province with its capital at Al-Mansurah , 72 km ( 45 mi ) north of modern Hyderabad in Sindh , Pakistan . After several incursions , the Hindu kings east of Indus defeated the Arabs at the Battle of Rajasthan , halting their expansion and containing them at Sindh in Pakistan . The south Indian Chalukya empire under Vikramaditya II , Nagabhata I of the Pratihara dynasty and Bappa Rawal of the Guhilot dynasty repulsed the Arab invaders in the early 8th century .
Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game . The game is played using a spherical ball of 68.5–69.5 cm ( 27.0–27.4 in ) circumference , known as the football ( or soccer ball ) . Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team 's goal ( between the posts and under the bar ) , thereby scoring a goal . The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner ; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw . Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game : to be involved in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks .
The establishment of the Santa Hermandad in 1480 , and of the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia in 1500—a tribunal and executive body directed by the Governor-Captain General as a direct representative of the King—implied initially the submission of the Kingdom to the Crown , after a century of unrest and fiscal insubordination . As a result , from 1480 to 1520 the Kingdom of Galicia contributed more than 10 % of the total earnings of the Crown of Castille , including the Americas , well over its economic relevance . Like the rest of Spain , the 16th century was marked by population growth up to 1580 , when the simultaneous wars with the Netherlands , France and England hampered Galicia 's Atlantic commerce , which consisted mostly in the exportation of sardines , wood , and some cattle and wine .
The " General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples " grants all indigenous languages spoken in Mexico , regardless of the number of speakers , the same validity as Spanish in all territories in which they are spoken , and indigenous peoples are entitled to request some public services and documents in their native languages . Along with Spanish , the law has granted them — more than 60 languages — the status of " national languages " . The law includes all indigenous languages of the Americas regardless of origin ; that is , it includes the indigenous languages of ethnic groups non-native to the territory . As such the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples recognizes the language of the Kickapoo , who immigrated from the United States , and recognizes the languages of the Guatemalan indigenous refugees . The Mexican government has promoted and established bilingual primary and secondary education in some indigenous rural communities . Nonetheless , of the indigenous peoples in Mexico , only about 67 % of them ( or 5.4 % of the country 's population ) speak an indigenous language and about a sixth do not speak Spanish ( 1.2 % of the country 's population ) .
Swiss are fans of football and the national team is nicknamed the 'Nati ' . The headquarters of the sport 's governing body , the International Federation of Association Football ( FIFA ) , is located in Zürich . Switzerland hosted the 1954 FIFA World Cup , and was the joint host , with Austria , of the Euro 2008 tournament . The Swiss Super League is the nation 's professional club league . For the Brasil 2014 World Cup finals tournament , the country 's German-speaking cantons will be closely monitored by local police forces to prevent celebrations beyond one hour after matches end . Europe 's highest football pitch , at 2,000 metres ( 6,600 ft ) above sea level , is located in Switzerland and is named the Ottmar Hitzfeld Stadium .
At the end of the 15th century the Ottoman Empire advanced all over Southeastern Europe , eventually conquering the Byzantine Empire and extending control over the Balkan states . Hungary was the last bastion of the Latin Christian world in the East , and fought to keep its rule over a period of two centuries . After the tragic death of the young king Vladislaus I of Hungary during the Battle of Varna in 1444 against the Ottomans , the Kingdom was placed in the hands of count John Hunyadi , who became Hungary 's regent-governor ( 1446–1453 ) . Hunyadi was considered one of the most relevant military figures of the 15th century : Pope Pius II awarded him the title of Athleta Christi or Champion of Christ for being the only hope of resisting the Ottomans from advancing to Central and Western Europe .
The Aeneid is widely considered Virgil 's finest work and one of the most important poems in the history of western literature . Virgil worked on the Aeneid during the last eleven years of his life ( 29–19 BC ) , commissioned , according to Propertius , by Augustus . The epic poem consists of 12 books in dactylic hexameter verse which describe the journey of Aeneas , a warrior fleeing the sack of Troy , to Italy , his battle with the Italian prince Turnus , and the foundation of a city from which Rome would emerge . The Aeneid 's first six books describe the journey of Aeneas from Troy to Rome . Virgil made use of several models in the composition of his epic ; Homer , the preeminent author of classical epic , is everywhere present , but Virgil also makes special use of the Latin poet Ennius and the Hellenistic poet Apollonius of Rhodes among the various other writers to which he alludes . Although the Aeneid casts itself firmly into the epic mode , it often seeks to expand the genre by including elements of other genres such as tragedy and aetiological poetry . Ancient commentators noted that Virgil seems to divide the Aeneid into two sections based on the poetry of Homer ; the first six books were viewed as employing the Odyssey as a model while the last six were connected to the Iliad .
Traditionally , Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona 's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority , in stark contrast to Barça 's revolutionary spirit . Also in the 1960s and 1970s , while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia 's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life , Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen , military officers , civil servants and career fascists .
To prevent further loss of groundwater , Tucson has been involved in water conservation and groundwater preservation efforts , shifting away from its reliance on a series of Tucson area wells in favor of conservation , consumption-based pricing for residential and commercial water use , and new wells in the more sustainable Avra Valley aquifer , northwest of the city . An allocation from the Central Arizona Project Aqueduct ( CAP ) , which passes more than 300 mi ( 480 km ) across the desert from the Colorado River , has been incorporated into the city 's water supply , annually providing over 20 million gallons of " recharged " water which is pumped into the ground to replenish water pumped out . Since 2001 , CAP water has allowed the city to remove or turn off over 80 wells .
The name Shell is linked to The " Shell " Transport and Trading Company . In 1833 , the founder 's father , Marcus Samuel , founded an import business to sell seashells to London collectors . When collecting seashell specimens in the Caspian Sea area in 1892 , the younger Samuel realised there was potential in exporting lamp oil from the region and commissioned the world 's first purpose-built oil tanker , the Murex ( Latin for a type of snail shell ) , to enter this market ; by 1907 the company had a fleet . Although for several decades the company had a refinery at Shell Haven on the Thames , there is no evidence of this having provided the name .
Detroit has four border crossings : the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel provide motor vehicle thoroughfares , with the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel providing railroad access to and from Canada . The fourth border crossing is the Detroit–Windsor Truck Ferry , located near the Windsor Salt Mine and Zug Island . Near Zug Island , the southwest part of the city was developed over a 1,500-acre ( 610 ha ) salt mine that is 1,100 feet ( 340 m ) below the surface . The Detroit Salt Company mine has over 100 miles ( 160 km ) of roads within .
The name Thuringia or Thüringen derives from the Germanic tribe Thuringii , who emerged during the Migration Period . Their origin is not completely known . An older theory claimed that they were successors of the Hermunduri , but later research rejected the idea . Other historians argue that the Thuringians were allies of the Huns , came to central Europe together with them , and lived before in what is Galicia today . Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus first mentioned the Thuringii around 400 ; during that period , the Thuringii were famous for their excellent horses .
During the Hellenistic period , many different schools of thought developed . Athens , with its multiple philosophical schools , continued to remain the center of philosophical thought . However Athens had now lost her political freedom and Hellenistic philosophy is a reflection of this new difficult period . In this political climate , Hellenistic philosophers went in search of goals such as ataraxia ( un-disturbedness ) , autarky ( self-sufficiency ) and apatheia ( freedom from suffering ) , which would allow them to wrest well-being or eudaimonia out of the most difficult turns of fortune . This occupation with the inner life , with personal inner liberty and with the pursuit of eudaimonia is what all Hellenistic philosophical schools have in common .
The LSPU Hall is home to the Resource Centre for the Arts . The " Hall " hosts a vibrant and diverse arts community and is regarded as the backbone of artistic infrastructure and development in the downtown . The careers of many well-known Newfoundland artists were launched there including Rick Mercer , Mary Walsh , Cathy Jones , Andy Jones and Greg Thomey . The St. John 's Arts and Culture Centre houses an art gallery , libraries and a 1000-seat theatre , which is the city 's major venue for entertainment productions .
Prior to the 2011–2012 season , Barcelona had a long history of avoiding corporate sponsorship on the playing shirts . On 14 July 2006 , the club announced a five-year agreement with UNICEF , which includes having the UNICEF logo on their shirts . The agreement had the club donate €1.5 million per year to UNICEF ( 0.7 percent of its ordinary income , equal to the UN International Aid Target , cf . ODA ) via the FC Barcelona Foundation . The FC Barcelona Foundation is an entity set up in 1994 on the suggestion of then-chairman of the Economical-Statutory Committee , Jaime Gil-Aluja . The idea was to set up a foundation that could attract financial sponsorships to support a non-profit sport company . In 2004 , a company could become one of 25 " Honorary members " by contributing between £40,000–60,000 ( £54,800–82,300 ) per year . There are also 48 associate memberships available for an annual fee of £14,000 ( £19,200 ) and an unlimited number of " patronages " for the cost of £4,000 per year ( £5,500 ) . It is unclear whether the honorary members have any formal say in club policy , but according to the author Anthony King , it is " unlikely that Honorary Membership would not involve at least some informal influence over the club " .
White light can be formed by mixing differently colored lights ; the most common method is to use red , green , and blue ( RGB ) . Hence the method is called multi-color white LEDs ( sometimes referred to as RGB LEDs ) . Because these need electronic circuits to control the blending and diffusion of different colors , and because the individual color LEDs typically have slightly different emission patterns ( leading to variation of the color depending on direction ) even if they are made as a single unit , these are seldom used to produce white lighting . Nonetheless , this method has many applications because of the flexibility of mixing different colors , and in principle , this mechanism also has higher quantum efficiency in producing white light .

Unlike other Germanic languages , Dutch does n't have phonological aspiration of consonants . Like English , Dutch did not participate in the second consonant shift . Like most Germanic languages , the Dutch consonant system did not undergo the High German consonant shift and has a syllable structure that allows fairly complex consonant clusters . Dutch also retains full use of the velar fricatives that were present in Proto-Germanic , but lost or modified in many other Germanic languages . Dutch has final-obstruent devoicing : at the end of a word , voicing distinction is neutralised and all obstruents are pronounced voiceless . For example , goede ( " good " ) is /ˈɣudə/ but the related form goed is /ɣut/ . Dutch shares with German Final-obstruent devoicing ( Du brood [ broːt ] and German Brot vs Eng bread ) .
The topic of language for writers from Dalmatia and Dubrovnik prior to the 19th century made a distinction only between speakers of Italian or Slavic , since those were the two main groups that inhabited Dalmatian city-states at that time . Whether someone spoke Croatian or Serbian was not an important distinction then , as the two languages were not distinguished by most speakers . This has been used as an argument to state that Croatian literature Croatian per se , but also includes Serbian and other languages that are part of Serbo-Croatian , These facts undermine the Croatian language proponents ' argument that modern-day Croatian is based on a language called Old Croatian .
Software testing is a part of the software quality assurance ( SQA ) process . :347 In SQA , software process specialists and auditors are concerned for the software development process rather than just the artifacts such as documentation , code and systems . They examine and change the software engineering process itself to reduce the number of faults that end up in the delivered software : the so-called " defect rate " . What constitutes an " acceptable defect rate " depends on the nature of the software ; A flight simulator video game would have much higher defect tolerance than software for an actual airplane . Although there are close links with SQA , testing departments often exist independently , and there may be no SQA function in some companies . [ citation needed ]
Since the Carnation Revolution of 1974 , which culminated in the end of one of Portugal 's most notable phases of economic expansion ( that started in the 1960s ) , a significant change has occurred in the nation 's annual economic growth . [ citation needed ] After the turmoil of the 1974 revolution and the PREC period , Portugal tried to adapt to a changing modern global economy , a process that continues in 2013 . Since the 1990s , Portugal 's public consumption-based economic development model has been slowly changing to a system that is focused on exports , private investment and the development of the high-tech sector . Consequently , business services have overtaken more traditional industries such as textiles , clothing , footwear and cork ( Portugal is the world 's leading cork producer ) , wood products and beverages .
The James River reaches tidewater at Richmond where flooding may occur in every month of the year , most frequently in March and least in July . Hurricanes and tropical storms have been responsible for most of the flooding during the summer and early fall months . Hurricanes passing near Richmond have produced record rainfalls . In 1955 , three hurricanes brought record rainfall to Richmond within a six-week period . The most noteworthy of these were Hurricane Connie and Hurricane Diane that brought heavy rains five days apart . And in 2004 , the downtown area suffered extensive flood damage after the remnants of Hurricane Gaston dumped up to 12 inches ( 300 mm ) of rainfall .
Discrete transistors are individually packaged transistors . Transistors come in many different semiconductor packages ( see image ) . The two main categories are through-hole ( or leaded ) , and surface-mount , also known as surface-mount device ( SMD ) . The ball grid array ( BGA ) is the latest surface-mount package ( currently only for large integrated circuits ) . It has solder " balls " on the underside in place of leads . Because they are smaller and have shorter interconnections , SMDs have better high-frequency characteristics but lower power rating .
Linguistic anthropology ( also called anthropological linguistics ) seeks to understand the processes of human communications , verbal and non-verbal , variation in language across time and space , the social uses of language , and the relationship between language and culture . It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems , linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes . Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics , pragmatics , cognitive linguistics , semiotics , discourse analysis , and narrative analysis .
Norfolk Island is the only non-mainland Australian territory to have achieved self-governance . The Norfolk Island Act 1979 , passed by the Parliament of Australia in 1979 , is the Act under which the island was governed until the passing of the Norfolk Island Legislation Amendment Act 2015 . The Australian government maintains authority on the island through an Administrator , currently Gary Hardgrave . From 1979 to 2015 , a Legislative Assembly was elected by popular vote for terms of not more than three years , although legislation passed by the Australian Parliament could extend its laws to the territory at will , including the power to override any laws made by the assembly .
Through Victoria 's reign , the gradual establishment of a modern constitutional monarchy in Britain continued . Reforms of the voting system increased the power of the House of Commons at the expense of the House of Lords and the monarch . In 1867 , Walter Bagehot wrote that the monarch only retained " the right to be consulted , the right to encourage , and the right to warn " . As Victoria 's monarchy became more symbolic than political , it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values , in contrast to the sexual , financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the House of Hanover and which had discredited the monarchy . The concept of the " family monarchy " , with which the burgeoning middle classes could identify , was solidified .
Under Peter I ( the Great ) , Russia was proclaimed an Empire in 1721 and became recognized as a world power . Ruling from 1682 to 1725 , Peter defeated Sweden in the Great Northern War , forcing it to cede West Karelia and Ingria ( two regions lost by Russia in the Time of Troubles ) , as well as Estland and Livland , securing Russia 's access to the sea and sea trade . On the Baltic Sea Peter founded a new capital called Saint Petersburg , later known as Russia 's Window to Europe . Peter the Great 's reforms brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia . Catherine II ( the Great ) , who ruled in 1762–96 , extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the Partitions of Poland , pushing the Russian frontier westward into Central Europe . In the south , after successful Russo-Turkish Wars against the Ottoman Empire , Catherine advanced Russia 's boundary to the Black Sea , defeating the Crimean khanate .
The league held its first season in 1992–93 and was originally composed of 22 clubs . The first ever Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2–1 win against Manchester United . The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were Arsenal , Aston Villa , Blackburn Rovers , Chelsea , Coventry City , Crystal Palace , Everton , Ipswich Town , Leeds United , Liverpool , Manchester City , Manchester United , Middlesbrough , Norwich City , Nottingham Forest , Oldham Athletic , Queens Park Rangers , Sheffield United , Sheffield Wednesday , Southampton , Tottenham Hotspur , and Wimbledon . Luton Town , Notts County and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old first division at the end of the 1991–92 season , and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season .
By the time Oklahoma was admitted to the Union in 1907 , Oklahoma City had surpassed Guthrie , the territorial capital , as the population center and commercial hub of the new state . Soon after , the capital was moved from Guthrie to Oklahoma City . Oklahoma City was a major stop on Route 66 during the early part of the 20th century ; it was prominently mentioned in Bobby Troup 's 1946 jazz classic , " ( Get Your Kicks on ) Route 66 " , later made famous by artist Nat King Cole .
Providing sufficient base drive current is a key problem in the use of bipolar transistors as switches . The transistor provides current gain , allowing a relatively large current in the collector to be switched by a much smaller current into the base terminal . The ratio of these currents varies depending on the type of transistor , and even for a particular type , varies depending on the collector current . In the example light-switch circuit shown , the resistor is chosen to provide enough base current to ensure the transistor will be saturated .
The first known European explorer to reach Bermuda was Spanish sea captain Juan de Bermúdez in 1503 , after whom the islands are named . He claimed the apparently uninhabited islands for the Spanish Empire . Paying two visits to the archipelago , Bermúdez never landed on the islands , but did create a recognisable map of the archipelago . Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners are now thought to have been responsible for the 1543 inscription in Portuguese Rock ( previously called Spanish Rock ) . Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there , which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began . In 1609 , the English Virginia Company , which had established Jamestown in Virginia ( a term originally applied to all of the North American continent ) two years earlier , permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane , when the crew and passengers of the Sea Venture steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent its sinking , then landed ashore .
Capacitors made with any type of dielectric material will show some level of " dielectric absorption " or " soakage " . On discharging a capacitor and disconnecting it , after a short time it may develop a voltage due to hysteresis in the dielectric . This effect can be objectionable in applications such as precision sample and hold circuits or timing circuits . The level of absorption depends on many factors , from design considerations to charging time , since the absorption is a time-dependent process . However , the primary factor is the type of dielectric material . Capacitors such as tantalum electrolytic or polysulfone film exhibit very high absorption , while polystyrene or Teflon allow very small levels of absorption . In some capacitors where dangerous voltages and energies exist , such as in flashtubes , television sets , and defibrillators , the dielectric absorption can recharge the capacitor to hazardous voltages after it has been shorted or discharged . Any capacitor containing over 10 joules of energy is generally considered hazardous , while 50 joules or higher is potentially lethal . A capacitor may regain anywhere from 0.01 to 20 % of its original charge over a period of several minutes , allowing a seemingly safe capacitor to become surprisingly dangerous .
After secession , some North Carolinians refused to support the Confederacy . Some of the yeoman farmers in the state 's mountains and western Piedmont region remained neutral during the Civil War , while some covertly supported the Union cause during the conflict . Approximately 2,000 North Carolinians from western North Carolina enlisted in the Union Army and fought for the North in the war . Two additional Union Army regiments were raised in the coastal areas of the state , which were occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863 . Numerous slaves escaped to Union lines , where they became essentially free .
Bateman was responsible for the building of 36 new buildings for the university both on and off campus , including the expansion of the Harold B. Lee Library . He was also one of several key college leaders who brought about the creation of the Mountain West Conference , which BYU 's athletics program joined — BYU previously participated in the Western Athletic Conference . A BYU satellite TV network also opened in 2000 under his leadership . Bateman was also president during the September 11th attacks in 2001 . The planes crashed on a Tuesday , hours before the weekly devotional normally held at BYU . Previous plans for the devotional were altered , as Bateman led the student body in a prayer for peace . Bateman was followed by Cecil O. Samuelson in 2003 . Samuelson was succeeded by Kevin J Worthen in 2014 .
Liverpool produced a number of nationally and internationally successful popular singers in the 1950s , including traditional pop stars Frankie Vaughan and Lita Roza , and one of the most successful British rock and roll stars in Billy Fury . Many Lancashire towns had vibrant skiffle scenes in the late 1950s , out of which by the early 1960s a flourishing culture of beat groups began to emerge , particularly around Liverpool and Manchester . It has been estimated that there were around 350 bands active in and around Liverpool in this era , often playing ballrooms , concert halls and clubs , among them the Beatles . After their national success from 1962 , a number of Liverpool performers were able to follow them into the charts , including Gerry & the Pacemakers , the Searchers and Cilla Black . The first act to break through in the UK who were not from Liverpool , or managed by Brian Epstein , were Freddie and the Dreamers , who were based in Manchester , as were Herman 's Hermits and the Hollies . Led by the Beatles , beat groups from the region spearheaded the British Invasion of the US , which made a major contribution to the development of rock music . After the decline of beat groups in the late 1960s the centre of rock culture shifted to London and there were relatively few local bands who achieved national prominence until the growth of a disco funk scene and the punk rock revolution in the mid and late 1970s .
From 1996 to 2002 , Tuvalu was one of the best-performing Pacific Island economies and achieved an average real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth rate of 5.6 % per annum . Since 2002 economic growth has slowed , with GDP growth of 1.5 % in 2008 . Tuvalu was exposed to rapid rises in world prices of fuel and food in 2008 , with the level of inflation peaking at 13.4 % . The International Monetary Fund 2010 Report on Tuvalu estimates that Tuvalu experienced zero growth in its 2010 GDP , after the economy contracted by about 2 % in 2009 . On 5 August 2012 , the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) concluded the Article IV consultation with Tuvalu , and assessed the economy of Tuvalu : " A slow recovery is underway in Tuvalu , but there are important risks . GDP grew in 2011 for the first time since the global financial crisis , led by the private retail sector and education spending . We expect growth to rise slowly " . The IMF 2014 Country Report noted that real GDP growth in Tuvalu had been volatile averaging only 1 percent in the past decade . The 2014 Country Report describes economic growth prospects as generally positive as the result of large revenues from fishing licenses , together with substantial foreign aid .
Plymouth is home to the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom ( MBA ) which conducts research in all areas of the marine sciences . The Plymouth Marine Laboratory is an offshoot of the MBA . Together with the National Marine Aquarium , the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Sciences , Plymouth University 's Marine Institute and the Diving Diseases Research Centre , these marine-related organisations form the Plymouth Marine Sciences Partnership . The Plymouth Marine Laboratory , which focuses on global issues of climate change and sustainability . It monitors the effects of ocean acidity on corals and shellfish and reports the results to the UK government . It also cultivates algae that could be used to make biofuels or in the treatment of waste water by using technology such as photo-bioreactors . It works alongside the Boots Group to investigate the use of algae in skin care protects , taking advantage of the chemicals they contain that adapt to protect themselves from the sun .
These deities formed a core pantheon ; there were additionally hundreds of minor ones . Sumerian gods could thus have associations with different cities , and their religious importance often waxed and waned with those cities ' political power . The gods were said to have created human beings from clay for the purpose of serving them . The temples organized the mass labour projects needed for irrigation agriculture . Citizens had a labor duty to the temple , though they could avoid it by a payment of silver .
The manipulation of time at higher latitudes ( for example Iceland , Nunavut or Alaska ) has little impact on daily life , because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons ( in comparison to other latitudes ) , and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of sync with standard working hours regardless of manipulations of the clock . DST is also of little use for locations near the equator , because these regions see only a small variation in daylight in the course of the year .
Ter-Petrosyan led Armenia alongside Defense Minister Vazgen Sargsyan through the Nagorno-Karabakh War with neighboring Azerbaijan . The initial post-Soviet years were marred by economic difficulties , which had their roots early in the Karabakh conflict when the Azerbaijani Popular Front managed to pressure the Azerbaijan SSR to instigate a railway and air blockade against Armenia . This move effectively crippled Armenia 's economy as 85 % of its cargo and goods arrived through rail traffic . In 1993 , Turkey joined the blockade against Armenia in support of Azerbaijan .
London was the world 's largest city from about 1831 to 1925 . London 's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics , claiming 14,000 lives in 1848 , and 6,000 in 1866 . Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world 's first local urban rail network . The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties ; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital . London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War while during the Second World War , the Blitz and other bombings by the German Luftwaffe , killed over 30,000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city . Immediately after the war , the 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium , at a time when London had barely recovered from the war .
Pub names are used to identify and differentiate each pub . Modern names are sometimes a marketing ploy or attempt to create " brand awareness " , frequently using a comic theme thought to be memorable , Slug and Lettuce for a pub chain being an example . Interesting origins are not confined to old or traditional names , however . Names and their origins can be broken up into a relatively small number of categories .
The team worked on a Wii control scheme , adapting camera control and the fighting mechanics to the new interface . A prototype was created that used a swinging gesture to control the sword from a first-person viewpoint , but was unable to show the variety of Link 's movements . When the third-person view was restored , Aonuma thought it felt strange to swing the Wii Remote with the right hand to control the sword in Link 's left hand , so the entire Wii version map was mirrored . [ p ] Details about Wii controls began to surface in December 2005 when British publication NGC Magazine claimed that when a GameCube copy of Twilight Princess was played on the Revolution , it would give the player the option of using the Revolution controller . Miyamoto confirmed the Revolution controller-functionality in an interview with Nintendo of Europe and Time reported this soon after . However , support for the Wii controller did not make it into the GameCube release . At E3 2006 , Nintendo announced that both versions would be available at the Wii launch , and had a playable version of Twilight Princess for the Wii . [ p ] Later , the GameCube release was pushed back to a month after the launch of the Wii .
Some other popular sights are the Waterloo Column , the Laves House , the Wangenheim Palace , the Lower Saxony State Archives , the Hanover Playhouse , the Kröpcke Clock , the Anzeiger Tower Block , the Administration Building of the NORD/LB , the Cupola Hall of the Congress Centre , the Lower Saxony Stock , the Ministry of Finance , the Garten Church , the Luther Church , the Gehry Tower ( designed by the American architect Frank O. Gehry ) , the specially designed Bus Stops , the Opera House , the Central Station , the Maschsee lake and the city forest Eilenriede , which is one of the largest of its kind in Europe . With around 40 parks , forests and gardens , a couple of lakes , two rivers and one canal , Hanover offers a large variety of leisure activities .
The front page caused outrage in Liverpool , where the paper lost more than three-quarters of its estimated 55,000 daily sales and still sells poorly in the city more than 25 years later ( around 12,000 ) . It is unavailable in many parts of the city , as many newsagents refuse to stock it . It was revealed in a documentary called Alexei Sayle 's Liverpool , aired in September 2008 , that many Liverpudlians will not even take the newspaper for free , and those who do may simply burn or tear it up . Liverpudlians refer to the paper as 'The Scum ' with campaigners believing it handicapped their fight for justice .
However , not all highest courts are named as such . Civil law states do not tend to have singular highest courts . Additionally , the highest court in some jurisdictions is not named the " Supreme Court " , for example , the High Court of Australia ; this is because decisions by the High Court could formerly be appealed to the Privy Council . On the other hand , in some places the court named the " Supreme Court " is not in fact the highest court ; examples include the New York Supreme Court , the Supreme Courts of several Canadian provinces/territories and the former Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales , which are all superseded by higher Courts of Appeal .
In 1924 , the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created as a part of Uzbekistan , but in 1929 the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic ( Tajik SSR ) was made a separate constituent republic , however the predominantly ethnic Tajik cities of Samarkand and Bukhara remained in the Uzbek SSR . Between 1927 and 1934 , collectivization of agriculture and a rapid expansion of cotton production took place , especially in the southern region . Soviet collectivization policy brought violence against peasants and forced resettlement occurred throughout Tajikistan . Consequently , some peasants fought collectivization and revived the Basmachi movement . Some small scale industrial development also occurred during this time along with the expansion of irrigation infrastructure .
North Carolina Museum of Art , occupying a large suburban campus on Blue Ridge Road near the North Carolina State Fairgrounds , maintains one of the premier public art collections located between Washington , D.C. , and Atlanta . In addition to its extensive collections of American Art , European Art and ancient art , the museum recently has hosted major exhibitions featuring Auguste Rodin ( in 2000 ) and Claude Monet ( in 2006-07 ) , each attracting more than 200,000 visitors . Unlike most prominent public museums , the North Carolina Museum of Art acquired a large number of the works in its permanent collection through purchases with public funds . The museum 's outdoor park is one of the largest such art parks in the country . The museum facility underwent a major expansion which greatly expanded the exhibit space that was completed in 2010 . The 127,000 sf new expansion is designed by NYC architect Thomas Phifer and Partners .
Some sections of the state feature architectural styles including Spanish revival , Florida vernacular , and Mediterranean Revival Style . It has the largest collection of Art Deco and Streamline Moderne buildings in both the United States and the entire world , most of which are located in the Miami metropolitan area , especially Miami Beach 's Art Deco District , constructed as the city was becoming a resort destination . A unique architectural design found only in Florida is the post-World War II Miami Modern , which can be seen in areas such as Miami 's MiMo Historic District .
Between the 1992–93 season and the 2012–13 season , Premier League clubs had won the UEFA Champions League four times ( as well as supplying five of the runners-up ) , behind Spain 's La Liga with six wins , and Italy 's Serie A with five wins , and ahead of , among others , Germany 's Bundesliga with three wins ( see table here ) . The FIFA Club World Cup ( or the FIFA Club World Championship , as it was originally called ) has been won by Premier league clubs once ( Manchester United in 2008 ) , and they have also been runners-up twice , behind Brazil 's Brasileirão with four wins , and Spain 's La Liga and Italy 's Serie A with two wins each ( see table here ) .
In the spring of 1854 the Russians again advanced , crossing the Danube River into the Turkish province of Dobruja . By April 1854 , the Russians had reached the lines of Trajan 's Wall where they were finally halted . In the center , the Russian forces crossed the Danube and laid siege to Silistra from 14 April with 60,000 troops , the defenders with 15,000 had supplies for three months . :415 The siege was lifted on 23 June 1854 . The English and French forces at this time were unable to take the field for lack of equipment . :415
The other usage refers to a language that is socially subordinated to a regional or national standard language , often historically cognate or related to the standard language , but not actually derived from it . In this sense , unlike in the first usage , the standard language would not itself be considered a " dialect , " as it is the dominant language in a particular state or region , whether in terms of social or political status , official status , predominance or prevalence , or all of the above . Meanwhile , the " dialects " subordinate to the standard language are generally not variations on the standard language but rather separate ( but often related ) languages in and of themselves . For example , most of the various regional Romance languages of Italy , often colloquially referred to as Italian " dialects , " are , in fact , not actually derived from modern standard Italian , but rather evolved from Vulgar Latin separately and individually from one another and independently of standard Italian , long prior to the diffusion of a national standardized language throughout what is now Italy . These various Latin-derived regional languages are therefore , in a linguistic sense , not truly " dialects " of the standard Italian language , but are instead better defined as their own separate languages . Conversely , with the spread of standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century , various regional versions or varieties of standard Italian developed , generally as a mix of the national standard Italian with local regional languages and local accents . These variations on standard Italian , known as regional Italian , would more appropriately be called " dialects " in accordance with the first linguistic definition of " dialect , " as they are in fact derived partially or mostly from standard Italian .
In the 1960s , the first Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed , and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time . The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China , having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise . Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968 , the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 metres on the upper deck , with approximately 1,580 metres spanning the river itself . Since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built . Going in the downstream direction , the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are : Dashengguan Bridge , Line 10 Metro Tunnel , Third Bridge , Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel , First Bridge , Second Bridge and Fourth Bridge .
The 1920s , with tourism at its peak , are considered by many historians as Atlantic City 's golden age . During Prohibition , which was enacted nationally in 1919 and lasted until 1933 , much liquor was consumed and gambling regularly took place in the back rooms of nightclubs and restaurants . It was during Prohibition that racketeer and political boss Enoch L. " Nucky " Johnson rose to power . Prohibition was largely unenforced in Atlantic City , and , because alcohol that had been smuggled into the city with the acquiescence of local officials could be readily obtained at restaurants and other establishments , the resort 's popularity grew further . The city then dubbed itself as " The World 's Playground " . Nucky Johnson 's income , which reached as much as $ 500,000 annually , came from the kickbacks he took on illegal liquor , gambling and prostitution operating in the city , as well as from kickbacks on construction projects .
The New York City Fire Department ( FDNY ) , provides fire protection , technical rescue , primary response to biological , chemical , and radioactive hazards , and emergency medical services for the five boroughs of New York City . The New York City Fire Department is the largest municipal fire department in the United States and the second largest in the world after the Tokyo Fire Department . The FDNY employs approximately 11,080 uniformed firefighters and over 3,300 uniformed EMTs and paramedics . The FDNY 's motto is New York 's Bravest .
The history of time in the United States includes DST during both world wars , but no standardization of peacetime DST until 1966 . In May 1965 , for two weeks , St. Paul , Minnesota and Minneapolis , Minnesota were on different times , when the capital city decided to join most of the nation by starting Daylight Saving Time while Minneapolis opted to follow the later date set by state law . In the mid-1980s , Clorox ( parent of Kingsford Charcoal ) and 7-Eleven provided the primary funding for the Daylight Saving Time Coalition behind the 1987 extension to US DST , and both Idaho senators voted for it based on the premise that during DST fast-food restaurants sell more French fries , which are made from Idaho potatoes .
Her Majesty 's Courts Service provide a Magistrates ' Court and a Combined Crown and County Court in the city . The Plymouth Borough Police , formed in 1836 , eventually became part of Devon and Cornwall Constabulary . There are police stations at Charles Cross and Crownhill ( the Divisional HQ ) and smaller stations at Plympton and Plymstock . The city has one of the Devon and Cornwall Area Crown Prosecution Service Divisional offices . Plymouth has five fire stations located in Camel 's Head , Crownhill , Greenbank , Plympton and Plymstock which is part of Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service . The Royal National Lifeboat Institution have an Atlantic 85 class lifeboat and Severn class lifeboat stationed at Millbay Docks .
The preserved records of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt ( the Reich Security Main Office ) show the persecution of Freemasons during the Holocaust . RSHA Amt VII ( Written Records ) was overseen by Professor Franz Six and was responsible for " ideological " tasks , by which was meant the creation of antisemitic and anti-Masonic propaganda . While the number is not accurately known , it is estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 Freemasons were killed under the Nazi regime . Masonic concentration camp inmates were graded as political prisoners and wore an inverted red triangle .
A psychological identity relates to self-image ( one 's mental model of oneself ) , self-esteem , and individuality . Consequently , Weinreich gives the definition " A person 's identity is defined as the totality of one 's self-construal , in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future " ; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity , such as : " One 's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one 's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one 's construal of past ancestry and one 's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity " ( Weinreich , 1986a ) .
The mandolin has been used extensively in the traditional music of England and Scotland for generations . Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums , instructional books and DVDs , as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents . The instrument has also found its way into British rock music . The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield ( and introduced by Vivian Stanshall ) on Oldfield 's album Tubular Bells , as well as on a number of his subsequent albums ( particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge ( 1974 ) and Ommadawn ( 1975 ) ) . It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne , who featured two members on the instrument , Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe , and whose " Fog on the Tyne " was the biggest selling UK album of 1971-1972 . The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs . Maggie May by Rod Stewart , which hit No . 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100 , also featured Jackson 's playing . It has also been used by other British rock musicians . Led Zeppelin 's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That 's the Way ; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page , who composed the song . Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do , and Black Country Woman . Pete Townshend of The Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme , along with many other tracks on Endless Wire . McGuinness Flint , for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single , When I 'm Dead And Gone , is another example . Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane 's Slim Chance , and played mandolin on their hit How Come . One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in The Incredible String Band . Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player ( beautiful track Pussy Willow ) , as is his guitarist Martin Barre . The popular song Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr . More recently , the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin , played by Ailidh Lennon , on tracks such as Fight , Start to End , and Medicine . British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs . Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London 's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs . The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse . It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney 's 2007 hit " Dance Tonight . " That was not the first time a Beatle played a mandolin , however ; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo , the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name . The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people . Also more recently hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures have been playing a song based primarily using a mandolin . This song was left off their debut album , and features former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones . [ citation needed ]
In addition , most Grand Lodges require the candidate to declare a belief in a Supreme Being . In a few cases , the candidate may be required to be of a specific religion . The form of Freemasonry most common in Scandinavia ( known as the Swedish Rite ) , for example , accepts only Christians . At the other end of the spectrum , " Liberal " or Continental Freemasonry , exemplified by the Grand Orient de France , does not require a declaration of belief in any deity , and accepts atheists ( a cause of discord with the rest of Freemasonry ) .
Christianity , Judaism , Zoroastrianism , and the Sunni branch of Islam are officially recognized by the government , and have reserved seats in the Iranian Parliament . But the Bahá'í Faith , which is said to be the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran , is not officially recognized , and has been persecuted during its existence in Iran since the 19th century . Since the 1979 Revolution , the persecution of Bahais has increased with executions , the denial of civil rights and liberties , and the denial of access to higher education and employment .
Cork is home to the RTÉ Vanbrugh Quartet , and to many musical acts , including John Spillane , The Frank And Walters , Sultans of Ping , Simple Kid , Microdisney , Fred , Mick Flannery and the late Rory Gallagher .

In the Middle Ages , several powerful Somali empires dominated the regional trade including the Ajuran Sultanate , which excelled in hydraulic engineering and fortress building , the Sultanate of Adal , whose general Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi ( Ahmed Gurey ) was the first commander to use cannon warfare on the continent during Adal 's conquest of the Ethiopian Empire , and the Sultanate of the Geledi , whose military dominance forced governors of the Omani empire north of the city of Lamu to pay tribute to the Somali Sultan Ahmed Yusuf .
From the 10th to the 13th century , Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction , affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland , Croatia , Sweden and Sicily . The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture , but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place , as did the expressions of Gothic taste . The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders do not define divisions of style . On the other hand , some regions such as England and Spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere , except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen , or the transfer of bishops . Regional differences that are apparent in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period often become even more apparent in the Gothic .
The only foreign diplomatic experience Montini underwent was his time in the nunciature in Warsaw , Poland in 1923 . Like Achille Ratti before him , [ a ] he felt confronted with the huge problem , not limited to Poland , of excessive nationalism : " This form of nationalism treats foreigners as enemies , especially foreigners with whom one has common frontiers . Then one seeks the expansion of one 's own country at the expense of the immediate neighbours . People grow up with a feeling of being hemmed in . Peace becomes a transient compromise between wars . " When he was recalled to Rome he was happy to go , because " this concludes this episode of my life , which has provided useful , though not always joyful , experiences . "
Although they did not fix their schedules to the clock in the modern sense , ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than modern DST does , often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of day length , so that each daylight hour was longer during summer . For example , Roman water clocks had different scales for different months of the year : at Rome 's latitude the third hour from sunrise , hora tertia , started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice , but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes . After ancient times , equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal , so civil time no longer varies by season . Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings , such as some Mount Athos monasteries and all Jewish ceremonies .
The Red Rose of Lancaster is the county flower found on the county 's heraldic badge and flag . The rose was a symbol of the House of Lancaster , immortalised in the verse " In the battle for England 's head/York was white , Lancaster red " ( referring to the 15th-century Wars of the Roses ) . The traditional Lancashire flag , a red rose on a white field , was not officially registered . When an attempt was made to register it with the Flag Institute it was found that it was officially registered by Montrose in Scotland , several hundred years earlier with the Lyon Office . Lancashire 's official flag is registered as a red rose on a gold field .
The army was still equipped with the Dreyse needle gun of Battle of Königgrätz fame , which was by this time showing the age of its 25-year-old design . The rifle had a range of only 600 m ( 2,000 ft ) and lacked the rubber breech seal that permitted aimed shots . The deficiencies of the needle gun were more than compensated for by the famous Krupp 6-pounder ( 3 kg ) steel breech-loading cannons being issued to Prussian artillery batteries . Firing a contact-detonated shell , the Krupp gun had a longer range and a higher rate of fire than the French bronze muzzle loading cannon , which relied on faulty time fuses .
From their beginnings in Sumer ( now Iraq ) around 3500 BC , the Mesopotamian people began to attempt to record some observations of the world with numerical data . But their observations and measurements were seemingly taken for purposes other than for elucidating scientific laws . A concrete instance of Pythagoras ' law was recorded , as early as the 18th century BC : the Mesopotamian cuneiform tablet Plimpton 322 records a number of Pythagorean triplets ( 3,4,5 ) ( 5,12,13 ) . ... , dated 1900 BC , possibly millennia before Pythagoras , but an abstract formulation of the Pythagorean theorem was not .
In 1984 , he was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour by Queen Elizabeth II on the advice of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for his " services to the study of economics " . He was the first recipient of the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize in 1984 . He also received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 from President George H. W. Bush . In 2011 , his article " The Use of Knowledge in Society " was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in The American Economic Review during its first 100 years .
Natural uranium consists of three major isotopes : uranium-238 ( 99.28 % natural abundance ) , uranium-235 ( 0.71 % ) , and uranium-234 ( 0.0054 % ) . All three are radioactive , emitting alpha particles , with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission , rather than alpha emission . There are also five other trace isotopes : uranium-239 , which is formed when 238U undergoes spontaneous fission , releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom ; uranium-237 , which is formed when 238U captures a neutron but emits two more , which then decays to neptunium-237 ; uranium-233 , which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237 ; and finally , uranium-236 and -240 , which appear in the decay chain of primordial plutonium-244 . It is also expected that thorium-232 should be able to undergo double beta decay , which would produce uranium-232 , but this has not yet been observed experimentally .
Islam and Judaism have a complex relationship . Traditionally Jews and Christians living in Muslim lands , known as dhimmis , were allowed to practice their religions and administer their internal affairs , but they were subject to certain conditions . They had to pay the jizya ( a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males ) to the Islamic state . Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule . They had several social and legal disabilities such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims . Many of the disabilities were highly symbolic . The one described by Bernard Lewis as " most degrading " was the requirement of distinctive clothing , not found in the Quran or hadith but invented in early medieval Baghdad ; its enforcement was highly erratic . On the other hand , Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile , or forced compulsion to change their religion , and they were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession .
Saint Helena produces what is said to be the most expensive coffee in the world . It also produces and exports Tungi Spirit , made from the fruit of the prickly or cactus pears , Opuntia ficus-indica ( " Tungi " is the local St Helenian name for the plant ) . Ascension Island , Tristan da Cunha and Saint Helena all issue their own postage stamps which provide a significant income .
In glaciated areas where the glacier moves faster than one km per year , glacial earthquakes occur . These are large scale temblors that have seismic magnitudes as high as 6.1 . The number of glacial earthquakes in Greenland peaks every year in July , August and September and is increasing over time . In a study using data from January 1993 through October 2005 , more events were detected every year since 2002 , and twice as many events were recorded in 2005 as there were in any other year . This increase in the numbers of glacial earthquakes in Greenland may be a response to global warming .
Many units are supplemented with a variety of specialized weapons , including the M249 SAW ( Squad Automatic Weapon ) , to provide suppressive fire at the fire-team level . Indirect fire is provided by the M203 grenade launcher . The M1014 Joint Service Combat Shotgun or the Mossberg 590 Shotgun are used for door breaching and close-quarters combat . The M14EBR is used by designated marksmen . Snipers use the M107 Long Range Sniper Rifle , the M2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle , and the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper Rifle .
The Japanese enlarged administration and appointed local leaders , which weakened the authority of local traditional leaders . Japan also tried to change the social organization in the islands from Matrilineality to the Japanese Patriarchal system , but with no success . Moreover , during the 1930s , one third of all land up to the high water level was declared the property of the Japanese government . On the archipelago , before it banned foreign traders , the activities of Catholic and Protestant missionaries were allowed . Indigenous people were educated in Japanese schools , and studied Japanese language and Japanese culture . This policy was the government strategy not only in the Marshall Islands , but on all the other mandated territories in Micronesia . On March 27 , 1933 , Japan handed in its notice at the League of Nations , but continued to manage the islands , and in the late 1930s began building air bases on several atolls . The Marshall Islands were in an important geographical position , being the easternmost point in Japan 's defensive ring at the beginning of World War II .
In 1888 , the Italian administration launched its first development projects in the new colony . The Eritrean Railway was completed to Saati in 1888 , and reached Asmara in the highlands in 1911 . The Asmara–Massawa Cableway was the longest line in the world during its time , but was later dismantled by the British in World War II . Besides major infrastructural projects , the colonial authorities invested significantly in the agricultural sector . It also oversaw the provision of urban amenities in Asmara and Massawa , and employed many Eritreans in public service , particularly in the police and public works departments . Thousands of Eritreans were concurrently enlisted in the army , serving during the Italo-Turkish War in Libya as well as the First and second Italo-Abyssinian Wars .
Apollo ( Attic , Ionic , and Homeric Greek : Ἀπόλλων , Apollōn ( GEN Ἀπόλλωνος ) ; Doric : Ἀπέλλων , Apellōn ; Arcadocypriot : Ἀπείλων , Apeilōn ; Aeolic : Ἄπλουν , Aploun ; Latin : Apollō ) is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology . The ideal of the kouros ( a beardless , athletic youth ) , Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music , truth and prophecy , healing , the sun and light , plague , poetry , and more . Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto , and has a twin sister , the chaste huntress Artemis . Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu .
The Sultanate of Ifat , led by the Walashma dynasty with its capital at Zeila , ruled over parts of what is now eastern Ethiopia , Djibouti , and northern Somalia . The historian al-Umari records that Ifat was situated near the Red Sea coast , and states its size as 15 days travel by 20 days travel . Its army numbered 15,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers . Al-Umari also credits Ifat with seven " mother cities " : Belqulzar , Kuljura , Shimi , Shewa , Adal , Jamme and Laboo .
He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics , in the development of functional analysis , a principal member of the Manhattan Project and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton ( as one of the few originally appointed ) , and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata , the universal constructor and the digital computer . He published 150 papers in his life ; 60 in pure mathematics , 20 in physics , and 60 in applied mathematics . His last work , an unfinished manuscript written while in the hospital , was later published in book form as The Computer and the Brain .
Nick Fradiani won the season , defeating Clark Beckham . By winning , Fradiani became the first winner from the Northeast region . Fradiani released " Beautiful Life " as his coronation single while Beckham released " Champion " . Jax , the third place finalist , also released a single called " Forcefield " .
In the last years of the nineteenth century , Planck was investigating the problem of black-body radiation first posed by Kirchhoff some forty years earlier . It is well known that hot objects glow , and that hotter objects glow brighter than cooler ones . The electromagnetic field obeys laws of motion similarly to a mass on a spring , and can come to thermal equilibrium with hot atoms . The hot object in equilibrium with light absorbs just as much light as it emits . If the object is black , meaning it absorbs all the light that hits it , then its thermal light emission is maximized .
If a more consistent report with the genetic groups in the gradation of miscegenation is to be considered ( e.g . that would not cluster people with a balanced degree of African and non-African ancestry in the black group instead of the multiracial one , unlike elsewhere in Latin America where people of high quantity of African descent tend to classify themselves as mixed ) , more people would report themselves as white and pardo in Brazil ( 47.7 % and 42.4 % of the population as of 2010 , respectively ) , because by research its population is believed to have between 65 and 80 % of autosomal European ancestry , in average ( also > 35 % of European mt-DNA and > 95 % of European Y-DNA ) .
Burke 's religious writing comprises published works and commentary on the subject of religion . Burke 's religious thought was grounded in the belief that religion is the foundation of civil society . He sharply criticised deism and atheism , and emphasised Christianity as a vehicle of social progress . Born in Ireland to a Catholic mother and a Protestant father , Burke vigorously defended the Anglican Church , but also demonstrated sensitivity to Catholic concerns . He linked the conservation of a state ( established ) religion with the preservation of citizens ' constitutional liberties and highlighted Christianity 's benefit not only to the believer 's soul , but also to political arrangements .
Several solid dielectrics are available , including paper , plastic , glass , mica and ceramic materials . Paper was used extensively in older devices and offers relatively high voltage performance . However , it is susceptible to water absorption , and has been largely replaced by plastic film capacitors . Plastics offer better stability and ageing performance , which makes them useful in timer circuits , although they may be limited to low operating temperatures and frequencies . Ceramic capacitors are generally small , cheap and useful for high frequency applications , although their capacitance varies strongly with voltage and they age poorly . They are broadly categorized as class 1 dielectrics , which have predictable variation of capacitance with temperature or class 2 dielectrics , which can operate at higher voltage . Glass and mica capacitors are extremely reliable , stable and tolerant to high temperatures and voltages , but are too expensive for most mainstream applications . Electrolytic capacitors and supercapacitors are used to store small and larger amounts of energy , respectively , ceramic capacitors are often used in resonators , and parasitic capacitance occurs in circuits wherever the simple conductor-insulator-conductor structure is formed unintentionally by the configuration of the circuit layout .
Even though the Board of Rites and Lifan Yuan performed some duties of a foreign office , they fell short of developing into a professional foreign service . It was not until 1861 — a year after losing the Second Opium War to the Anglo-French coalition — that the Qing government bowed to foreign pressure and created a proper foreign affairs office known as the Zongli Yamen . The office was originally intended to be temporary and was staffed by officials seconded from the Grand Council . However , as dealings with foreigners became increasingly complicated and frequent , the office grew in size and importance , aided by revenue from customs duties which came under its direct jurisdiction .
One disadvantage of the phalanx was that it was only effective when fighting in large , open spaces , which left the Romans at a disadvantage when fighting in the hilly terrain of central Italian peninsula . In the 4th century BC , the Romans abandoned the phalanx in favour of the more flexible manipular formation . This change is sometimes attributed to Marcus Furius Camillus and placed shortly after the Gallic invasion of 390 BC ; it is more likely , however , that they were copied from Rome 's Samnite enemies to the south , possibly as a result of Samnite victories during the Second Samnite War ( 326 to 304 BC ) .
On 20 December 2012 , Pope Benedict XVI , in an audience with the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints , declared that the late pontiff had lived a life of heroic virtue , which means that he could be called " Venerable " . A miracle attributed to the intercession of Paul VI was approved on 9 May 2014 by Pope Francis . The beatification ceremony for Paul VI was held on 19 October 2014 , which means that he can now be called " Blessed " . His liturgical feast day is celebrated on the date of his birth , 26 September , rather than the day of his death as is usual .
London was the world 's largest city from about 1831 to 1925 . London 's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics , claiming 14,000 lives in 1848 , and 6,000 in 1866 . Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world 's first local urban rail network . The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties ; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital . London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War while during the Second World War , the Blitz and other bombings by the German Luftwaffe , killed over 30,000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city . Immediately after the war , the 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium , at a time when London had barely recovered from the war .
In the 13th century , Hōjō Shigetoki ( 1198–1261 AD ) wrote : " When one is serving officially or in the master 's court , he should not think of a hundred or a thousand people , but should consider only the importance of the master . " Carl Steenstrup noted that 13th and 14th century warrior writings ( gunki ) " portrayed the bushi in their natural element , war , eulogizing such virtues as reckless bravery , fierce family pride , and selfless , at times senseless devotion of master and man " . Feudal lords such as Shiba Yoshimasa ( 1350–1410 AD ) stated that a warrior looked forward to a glorious death in the service of a military leader or the Emperor : " It is a matter of regret to let the moment when one should die pass by ... .First , a man whose profession is the use of arms should think and then act upon not only his own fame , but also that of his descendants . He should not scandalize his name forever by holding his one and only life too dear ... .One 's main purpose in throwing away his life is to do so either for the sake of the Emperor or in some great undertaking of a military general . It is that exactly that will be the great fame of one 's descendants . "
The Buddha 's death is seen as an illusion , he is living on in other planes of existence , and monks are therefore permitted to offer " new truths " based on his input . Mahayana also differs from Theravada in its concept of śūnyatā ( that ultimately nothing has existence ) , and in its belief in bodhisattvas ( enlightened people who vow to continue being reborn until all beings can be enlightened ) .
Pope Julius had died in April , 352 , and was succeeded by Liberius . For two years Liberius had been favourable to the cause of Athanasius ; but driven at last into exile , he was induced to sign an ambiguous formula , from which the great Nicene text , the " homoousion " , had been studiously omitted . In 355 a council was held at Milan , where in spite of the vigorous opposition of a handful of loyal prelates among the Western bishops , a fourth condemnation of Athanasius was announced to the world . With his friends scattered , the saintly Hosius in exile , and Pope Liberius denounced as acquiescing in Arian formularies , Athanasius could hardly hope to escape . On the night of 8 February , 356 , while engaged in services in the Church of St. Thomas , a band of armed men burst in to secure his arrest . It was the beginning of his third exile .
The Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale ( Yale 1773 ) was the prototype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th century : a manly yet aristocratic scholar , equally well-versed in knowledge and sports , and a patriot who " regretted " that he " had but one life to lose " for his country . Western painter Frederic Remington ( Yale 1900 ) was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the Wild West . The fictional , turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice , and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel Stover at Yale ( 1911 ) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school . Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes , especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body , and the alumni , as well as the team itself .
On January 25 , 1918 , at the third meeting of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets , the unrecognized state was renamed the Soviet Russian Republic . On March 3 , 1918 , the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed , giving away much of the land of the former Russian Empire to Germany , in exchange for peace in World War I . On July 10 , 1918 , the Russian Constitution of 1918 renamed the country the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic . By 1918 , during the Russian Civil War , several states within the former Russian Empire had seceded , reducing the size of the country even more .
In September 2010 , Brian May announced in a BBC interview that Sacha Baron Cohen was to play Mercury in a film of the same name . Time commented with approval on his singing ability and visual similarity to Mercury . However , in July 2013 , Baron Cohen dropped out of the role due to " creative differences " between him and the surviving band members . In December 2013 , it was announced that Ben Whishaw , best known for playing Q in the James Bond film Skyfall , had been chosen to replace Cohen in the role of Mercury . The motion picture is being written by Peter Morgan , who had been nominated for Oscars for his screenplays The Queen and Frost/Nixon . The film , which is being co-produced by Robert De Niro 's TriBeCa Productions , will focus on Queen 's formative years and the period leading up to the celebrated performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert .
In Apollo 's role as a healer , his appellations included Acesius ( /əˈsiːʒəs/ ə-SEE-zhəs ; Ἀκέσιος , Akesios , from ἄκεσις , " healing " ) , Acestor ( /əˈsɛstər/ ə-SES-tər ; Ἀκέστωρ , Akestōr , literally " healer " ) , Paean ( /ˈpiːən/ PEE-ən ; Παιάν , Paiān , from παίειν , " to touch " ) , [ citation needed ] and Iatrus ( /aɪˈætrəs/ eye-AT-rəs ; Ἰατρός , Iātros , literally " physician " ) . Acesius was the epithet of Apollo worshipped in Elis , where he had a temple in the agora . The Romans referred to Apollo as Medicus ( /ˈmɛdᵻkəs/ MED-i-kəs ; literally " physician " in Latin ) in this respect . A temple was dedicated to Apollo Medicus at Rome , probably next to the temple of Bellona .
The successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors . These include host defense mechanisms , the location of infection , and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial . A bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase , and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells . These findings are based on laboratory studies , and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection . Since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration , in vitro characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial . To predict clinical outcome , the antimicrobial activity of an antibacterial is usually combined with its pharmacokinetic profile , and several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy .
There are 20 clubs in the Premier League . During the course of a season ( from August to May ) each club plays the others twice ( a double round-robin system ) , once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents , for a total of 38 games . Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw . No points are awarded for a loss . Teams are ranked by total points , then goal difference , and then goals scored . If still equal , teams are deemed to occupy the same position . If there is a tie for the championship , for relegation , or for qualification to other competitions , a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank . The three lowest placed teams are relegated into the Football League Championship , and the top two teams from the Championship , together with the winner of play-offs involving the third to sixth placed Championship clubs , are promoted in their place .
The England national football team represents England and the Crown Dependencies of Jersey , Guernsey and the Isle of Man for football matches as part of FIFA-authorised events , and is controlled by The Football Association , the governing body for football in England . England are one of the two oldest national teams in football ; alongside Scotland , whom they played in the world 's first international football match in 1872 . England 's home ground is Wembley Stadium , London , and the current team manager is Roy Hodgson .
The question of whether the government should intervene or not in the regulation of the cyberspace is a very polemical one . Indeed , for as long as it has existed and by definition , the cyberspace is a virtual space free of any government intervention . Where everyone agree that an improvement on cybersecurity is more than vital , is the government the best actor to solve this issue ? Many government officials and experts think that the government should step in and that there is a crucial need for regulation , mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem . R. Clarke said during a panel discussion at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco , he believes that the " industry only responds when you threaten regulation . If industry does n't respond ( to the threat ) , you have to follow through . " On the other hand , executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary , but think that the government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently .
The treaty was published in the United States for the first time by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on May 22 , 1946 , in Britain by the Manchester Guardian . It was also part of an official State Department publication , Nazi–Soviet Relations 1939–1941 , edited by Raymond J. Sontag and James S. Beddie in January 1948 . The decision to publish the key documents on German–Soviet relations , including the treaty and protocol , had been taken already in spring 1947 . Sontag and Beddie prepared the collection throughout the summer of 1947 . In November 1947 , President Truman personally approved the publication but it was held back in view of the Foreign Ministers Conference in London scheduled for December . Since negotiations at that conference did not prove constructive from an American point of view , the document edition was sent to press . The documents made headlines worldwide . State Department officials counted it as a success : " The Soviet Government was caught flat-footed in what was the first effective blow from our side in a clear-cut propaganda war . "
In 2008 , State Council established a counterpart support plan ( 《汶川地震灾后恢复重建对口支援方案》 ) . The plan is to arrange 19 eastern and central province and municipalitie to help 18 counties , on " one province to one affected county " basis . The plan spanned 3 years , and cost no less than one percent of the province or municipality 's budget .
Although the city is not particularly noted for theatre and drama , the state government promotes theatre with multiple programmes and festivals in such venues as the Ravindra Bharati , Shilpakala Vedika and Lalithakala Thoranam . Although not a purely music oriented event , Numaish , a popular annual exhibition of local and national consumer products , does feature some musical performances . The city is home to the Telugu film industry , popularly known as Tollywood and as of 2012 [ update ] , produces the second largest number of films in India behind Bollywood . Films in the local Hyderabadi dialect are also produced and have been gaining popularity since 2005 . The city has also hosted international film festivals such as the International Children 's Film Festival and the Hyderabad International Film Festival . In 2005 , Guinness World Records declared Ramoji Film City to be the world 's largest film studio .
In 2004 the old Drake Circus shopping centre and Charles Cross car park were demolished and replaced by the latest Drake Circus Shopping Centre , which opened in October 2006 . It received negative feedback before opening when David Mackay said it was already " ten years out of date " . In contrast , the Theatre Royal 's production and education centre , TR2 , which was built on wasteland at Cattedown , was a runner-up for the RIBA Stirling Prize for Architecture in 2003 .
Throughout the history of the South Slavs , the vernacular , literary , and written languages ( e.g . Chakavian , Kajkavian , Shtokavian ) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently . Prior to the 19th century , they were collectively called " Illyric " , " Slavic " , " Slavonian " , " Bosnian " , " Dalmatian " , " Serbian " or " Croatian " . As such , the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824 , popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades , and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859 . At that time , Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires . Officially , the language was called variously Serbo-Croat , Croato-Serbian , Serbian and Croatian , Croatian and Serbian , Serbian or Croatian , Croatian or Serbian . Unofficially , Serbs and Croats typically called the language " Serbian " or " Croatian " , respectively , without implying a distinction between the two , and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina , " Bosnian " , " Croatian " , and " Serbian " were considered to be three names of a single official language . Croatian linguist Dalibor Brozović advocated the term Serbo-Croatian as late as 1988 , claiming that in an analogy with Indo-European , Serbo-Croatian does not only name the two components of the same language , but simply charts the limits of the region in which it is spoken and includes everything between the limits ( ‘Bosnian’ and ‘Montenegrin’ ) . Today , use of the term " Serbo-Croatian " is controversial due to the prejudice that nation and language must match . It is still used for lack of a succinct alternative , though alternative names have been used , such as Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian ( BCS ) , which is often seen in political contexts such as the Hague War Crimes tribunal .
The most impressive and famous of Sumerian buildings are the ziggurats , large layered platforms which supported temples . Sumerian cylinder seals also depict houses built from reeds not unlike those built by the Marsh Arabs of Southern Iraq until as recently as 400 CE . The Sumerians also developed the arch , which enabled them to develop a strong type of dome . They built this by constructing and linking several arches . Sumerian temples and palaces made use of more advanced materials and techniques , [ citation needed ] such as buttresses , recesses , half columns , and clay nails .
On 6 April 1941 , German forces , with Hungarian and Italian assistance , launched an invasion of Yugoslavia . On 10 April 1941 , Slavko Kvaternik proclaimed the Independent State of Croatia , and Tito responded by forming a Military Committee within the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party . Attacked from all sides , the armed forces of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia quickly crumbled . On 17 April 1941 , after King Peter II and other members of the government fled the country , the remaining representatives of the government and military met with the German officials in Belgrade . They quickly agreed to end military resistance . On 1 May 1941 , Tito issued a pamphlet calling on the people to unite in a battle against the occupation . On 27 June 1941 , the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia appointed Tito Commander in Chief of all project national liberation military forces . On 1 July 1941 , the Comintern sent precise instructions calling for immediate action .
However , Samoans greatly resented New Zealand 's colonial rule , and blamed inflation and the catastrophic 1918 flu epidemic on its misrule . By the late 1920s the resistance movement against colonial rule had gathered widespread support . One of the Mau leaders was Olaf Frederick Nelson , a half Samoan and half Swedish merchant . Nelson was eventually exiled during the late 1920s and early 1930s , but he continued to assist the organisation financially and politically . In accordance with the Mau 's non-violent philosophy , the newly elected leader , High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi , led his fellow uniformed Mau in a peaceful demonstration in downtown Apia on 28 December 1929 .
Baptist historian Bruce Gourley outlines four main views of Baptist origins : ( 1 ) The modern scholarly consensus that the movement traces its origin to the 17th century via the English Separatists , ( 2 ) the view that it was an outgrowth of Anabaptist traditions , ( 3 ) the perpetuity view which assumes that the Baptist faith and practice has existed since the time of Christ , and ( 4 ) the successionist view , or " Baptist successionism " , which argues that Baptist churches actually existed in an unbroken chain since the time of Christ .
The foundation has donated billions of dollars to help sufferers of AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria , protecting millions of children from death at the hands of preventable diseases . However , a 2007 investigation by The Los Angeles Times claimed there are three major unintended consequences with the foundation 's allocation of aid . First , sub-Saharan Africa already suffered from a shortage of primary doctors before the arrival of the Gates Foundation , but " by pouring most contributions into the fight against such high-profile killers as AIDS , Gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained , higher-paid clinicians , diverting staff from basic care " in sub-Saharan Africa . This " brain drain " adds to the existing doctor shortage and pulls away additional trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers . Second , " the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation " . Third , " Gates-funded vaccination programs have instructed caregivers to ignore – even discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations can not prevent " .

The Chinese intervention in late October 1950 bolstered the Korean People 's Air Force ( KPAF ) of North Korea with the MiG-15 , one of the world 's most advanced jet fighters . The fast , heavily armed MiG outflew first-generation UN jets such as the F-80 ( United States Air Force ) and Gloster Meteors ( Royal Australian Air Force ) , posing a real threat to B-29 Superfortress bombers even under fighter escort . Fearful of confronting the United States directly , the Soviet Union denied involvement of their personnel in anything other than an advisory role , but air combat quickly resulted in Soviet pilots dropping their code signals and speaking over the wireless in Russian . This known direct Soviet participation was a casus belli that the UN Command deliberately overlooked , lest the war for the Korean peninsula expand to include the Soviet Union , and potentially escalate into atomic warfare .
On 11 August , Barcelona started the 2015–16 season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating Sevilla FC 5–4 in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup . They ended the year with a 3–0 win over Argentine club River Plate in the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup Final on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time , with Suárez , Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament . The FIFA Club World Cup was Barcelona 's 20th international title , a record only matched by Egyptian club Al Ahly SC . By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions , Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year , breaking Real Madrid 's record of 178 goals scored in 2014 .
Countering Krugman , Peter J. Wallison wrote : " It is not true that every bubble—even a large bubble—has the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates . " Wallison notes that other developed countries had " large bubbles during the 1997–2007 period " but " the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the United States when the 1997–2007 [ bubble ] deflated . " According to Wallison , the reason the U.S. residential housing bubble ( as opposed to other types of bubbles ) led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loans – generally with low or no downpayments .
Phillips released " Home " as his coronation song , while Sanchez released " Change Nothing " . Phillips ' " Home " has since become the best selling of all coronation songs .
The tourism district would comprise several key areas in the city ; the Marina District , Ducktown , Chelsea , South Inlet , Bader Field , and Gardner 's Basin . Also included are 10 roadways that lead into the district , including several in the city 's northern end , or North Beach . Gardner 's Basin , which is home to the Atlantic City Aquarium , was initially left out of the tourism district , while a residential neighborhood in the Chelsea section was removed from the final boundaries , owing to complaints from the city . Also , the inclusion of Bader Field in the district was controversial and received much scrutiny from mayor Lorenzo Langford , who cast the lone " no " vote on the creation of the district citing its inclusion .
Since the 2010 election , the government has embarked on a series of reforms to direct the country towards liberal democracy , a mixed economy , and reconciliation , although doubts persist about the motives that underpin such reforms . The series of reforms includes the release of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest , the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission , the granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners , new labour laws that permit labour unions and strikes , a relaxation of press censorship , and the regulation of currency practices .
On August 5 , 2008 , SCA and Bertelsmann announced that Sony had agreed to acquire Bertelsmann 's 50 % stake in Sony BMG . Sony completed its acquisition of Bertelsmann 's 50 % stake in the companies ' joint venture on October 1 , 2008 . The company , once again named Sony Music Entertainment Inc. , became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Corporation through its US subsidiary SCA . The last few albums to feature a Sony BMG logo were Thriller 25 by Michael Jackson , I Am ... Sasha Fierce by Beyoncé , Keeps Gettin ' Better : A Decade of Hits by Christina Aguilera , and Safe Trip Home by Dido . A temporary logo was unveiled beginning December 1 , 2008 . The present logo was unveiled in March 2009 .
The brushless wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed ( BWRSDF ) machine is the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology ( i.e. , both ports independently excited with no short-circuited port ) . The dual ported transformer circuit topology is known to be unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set . If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set , the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable . Torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated .
According to the preamble in The Law of Treaties , treaties are a source of international law . If an act or lack thereof is condemned under international law , the act will not assume international legality even if approved by internal law . This means that in case of a conflict with domestic law , international law will always prevail .
According to the Office for National Statistics , at the 2001 census there were over a million black people in the United Kingdom ; 1 % of the total population described themselves as " Black Caribbean " , 0.8 % as " Black African " , and 0.2 % as " Black other " . Britain encouraged the immigration of workers from the Caribbean after World War II ; the first symbolic movement was those who came on the ship the Empire Windrush . The preferred official umbrella term is " black and minority ethnic " ( BME ) , but sometimes the term " black " is used on its own , to express unified opposition to racism , as in the Southall Black Sisters , which started with a mainly British Asian constituency , and the National Black Police Association , which has a membership of " African , African-Caribbean and Asian origin " .
In their attempt to ensure white supremacy decades after emancipation , in the early 20th century , most southern states created laws based on the one-drop rule , defining as black , persons with any known African ancestry . This was a stricter interpretation than what had prevailed in the 19th century ; it ignored the many mixed families in the state and went against commonly accepted social rules of judging a person by appearance and association . Some courts called it " the traceable amount rule . " Anthropologists called it an example of a hypodescent rule , meaning that racially mixed persons were assigned the status of the socially subordinate group .
Chapter VIII addresses the idea that species had special characteristics that prevented hybrids from being fertile in order to preserve separately created species . Darwin said that , far from being constant , the difficulty in producing hybrids of related species , and the viability and fertility of the hybrids , varied greatly , especially among plants . Sometimes what were widely considered to be separate species produced fertile hybrid offspring freely , and in other cases what were considered to be mere varieties of the same species could only be crossed with difficulty . Darwin concluded : " Finally , then , the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to , but even rather to support the view , that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties . "
In December , Beyoncé along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for " Demand A Plan " , a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 US mayors and others designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws , following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting . Beyoncé became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song " I Was Here " and its music video , shot in the UN , to the campaign . In 2013 , it was announced that Beyoncé would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci " Chime for Change " campaign that aims to spread female empowerment . The campaign , which aired on February 28 , was set to her new music . A concert for the cause took place on June 1 , 2013 in London and included other acts like Ellie Goulding , Florence and the Machine , and Rita Ora . In advance of the concert , she appeared in a campaign video released on 15 May 2013 , where she , along with Cameron Diaz , John Legend and Kylie Minogue , described inspiration from their mothers , while a number of other artists celebrated personal inspiration from other women , leading to a call for submission of photos of women of viewers ' inspiration from which a selection was shown at the concert . Beyoncé said about her mother Tina Knowles that her gift was " finding the best qualities in every human being . " With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult , visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls . Beyoncé is also taking part in " Miss a Meal " , a food-donation campaign , and supporting Goodwill charity through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S .
One example of omnidirectional antennas is the very common vertical antenna or whip antenna consisting of a metal rod ( often , but not always , a quarter of a wavelength long ) . A dipole antenna is similar but consists of two such conductors extending in opposite directions , with a total length that is often , but not always , a half of a wavelength long . Dipoles are typically oriented horizontally in which case they are weakly directional : signals are reasonably well radiated toward or received from all directions with the exception of the direction along the conductor itself ; this region is called the antenna blind cone or null .
In 2006 , Beyoncé introduced her all-female tour band Suga Mama ( also the name of a song in B'Day ) which includes bassists , drummers , guitarists , horn players , keyboardists and percussionists . Her background singers , The Mamas , consist of Montina Cooper-Donnell , Crystal Collins and Tiffany Moniqué Riddick . They made their debut appearance at the 2006 BET Awards and re-appeared in the music videos for " Irreplaceable " and " Green Light " . The band have supported Beyoncé in most subsequent live performances , including her 2007 concert tour The Beyoncé Experience , 2009–2010 I Am ... World Tour and 2013–2014 The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour .
In particle physics , this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of virtual particles which carry momentum , exchange by which and with real particles , is responsible for the creation of all known fundamental forces ( more accurately known as fundamental interactions ) . Virtual photons ( which are simply lowest quantum mechanical energy state of photons ) are also responsible for electrostatic interaction between electric charges ( which results in Coulomb law ) , for spontaneous radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states , for the Casimir force , for van der Waals bond forces and some other observable phenomena .
Under the millet system , non-Muslim people were considered subjects of the Empire , but were not subject to the Muslim faith or Muslim law . The Orthodox millet , for instance , was still officially legally subject to Justinian 's Code , which had been in effect in the Byzantine Empire for 900 years . Also , as the largest group of non-Muslim subjects ( or zimmi ) of the Islamic Ottoman state , the Orthodox millet was granted a number of special privileges in the fields of politics and commerce , and had to pay higher taxes than Muslim subjects .
Before emerging as a pop star , Madonna has spent her early years in rock music alongside her bands , Breakfast Club and Emmy . While performing with Emmy , Madonna recorded about 12-14 songs which resemble the punk rock of that period . Her early rock roots also can be found on the demo album Pre-Madonna . Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that with her self-titled debut album , Madonna began her career as a disco diva , in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of . In the beginning of the '80 's , disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop , and according to Erlewine , Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music . The album 's songs reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success , including a strong dance-based idiom , catchy hooks , highly polished arrangements and Madonna 's own vocal style . Her second album , Like a Virgin ( 1984 ) , foreshadowed several trends in her later works . It contained references to classical works ( pizzicato synthesizer line that opens " Angel " ) ; potential negative reaction from social groups ( " Dress You Up " was blacklisted by the Parents Music Resource Center ) ; and retro styles ( " Shoo-Bee-Doo " , Madonna 's homage to Motown ) .
After the death of Lysimachus , one of his officers , Philetaerus , took control of the city of Pergamum in 282 BC along with Lysimachus ' war chest of 9,000 talents and declared himself loyal to Seleucus I while remaining de facto independent . His descendant , Attalus I , defeated the invading Galatians and proclaimed himself an independent king . Attalus I ( 241–197BC ) , was a staunch ally of Rome against Philip V of Macedon during the first and second Macedonian Wars . For his support against the Seleucids in 190 BCE , Eumenes II was rewarded with all the former Seleucid domains in Asia Minor . Eumenes II turned Pergamon into a centre of culture and science by establishing the library of Pergamum which was said to be second only to the library of Alexandria with 200,000 volumes according to Plutarch . It included a reading room and a collection of paintings . Eumenes II also constructed the Pergamum Altar with friezes depicting the Gigantomachy on the acropolis of the city . Pergamum was also a center of parchment ( charta pergamena ) production . The Attalids ruled Pergamon until Attalus III bequeathed the kingdom to the Roman Republic in 133 BC to avoid a likely succession crisis .
Richmond city government consists of a city council with representatives from nine districts serving in a legislative and oversight capacity , as well as a popularly elected , at-large mayor serving as head of the executive branch . Citizens in each of the nine districts elect one council representative each to serve a four-year term . Beginning with the November 2008 election Council terms was lengthened to 4 years . The city council elects from among its members one member to serve as Council President and one to serve as Council Vice President . The city council meets at City Hall , located at 900 E. Broad St. , 2nd Floor , on the second and fourth Mondays of every month , except August .
The first years of the 14th century were marked by famines , culminating in the Great Famine of 1315–17 . The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age , which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures . The years 1313–14 and 1317–21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe , resulting in widespread crop failures . The climate change—which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century—was accompanied by an economic downturn .
In response to a given problem situation ( ) , a number of competing conjectures , or tentative theories ( ) , are systematically subjected to the most rigorous attempts at falsification possible . This process , error elimination ( ) , performs a similar function for science that natural selection performs for biological evolution . Theories that better survive the process of refutation are not more true , but rather , more " fit " —in other words , more applicable to the problem situation at hand ( ) . Consequently , just as a species ' biological fitness does not ensure continued survival , neither does rigorous testing protect a scientific theory from refutation in the future . Yet , as it appears that the engine of biological evolution has , over many generations , produced adaptive traits equipped to deal with more and more complex problems of survival , likewise , the evolution of theories through the scientific method may , in Popper 's view , reflect a certain type of progress : toward more and more interesting problems ( ) . For Popper , it is in the interplay between the tentative theories ( conjectures ) and error elimination ( refutation ) that scientific knowledge advances toward greater and greater problems ; in a process very much akin to the interplay between genetic variation and natural selection .
Certain bacteria form close spatial associations that are essential for their survival . One such mutualistic association , called interspecies hydrogen transfer , occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids , such as butyric acid or propionic acid , and produce hydrogen , and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen . The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings . Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow .
Several certification programs exist to support the professional aspirations of software testers and quality assurance specialists . No certification now offered actually requires the applicant to show their ability to test software . No certification is based on a widely accepted body of knowledge . This has led some to declare that the testing field is not ready for certification . Certification itself can not measure an individual 's productivity , their skill , or practical knowledge , and can not guarantee their competence , or professionalism as a tester .
Sugar taken orally reduces the total crying time but not the duration of the first cry in newborns undergoing a painful procedure ( a single lancing of the heel ) . It does not moderate the effect of pain on heart rate and a recent single study found that sugar did not significantly affect pain-related electrical activity in the brains of newborns one second after the heel lance procedure . Sweet oral liquid moderately reduces the incidence and duration of crying caused by immunization injection in children between one and twelve months of age .
In February 1939 , he received news from his sisters that his mother was dying . On 10 February 1939 , Pope Pius XI died . Roncalli was unable to see his mother for the end as the death of a pontiff meant that he would have to stay at his post until the election of a new pontiff . Unfortunately , she died on 20 February 1939 , during the nine days of mourning for the late Pius XI . He was sent a letter by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli , and Roncalli later recalled that it was probably the last letter Pacelli sent until his election as Pope Pius XII on 2 March 1939 . Roncalli expressed happiness that Pacelli was elected , and , on radio , listened to the coronation of the new pontiff .
In Greece Carnival is also known as the Apokriés ( Greek : Αποκριές , " saying goodbye to meat " ) , or the season of the " Opening of the Triodion " , so named after the liturgical book used by the church from then until Holy Week . One of the season 's high points is Tsiknopempti , when celebrants enjoy roast beef dinners ; the ritual is repeated the following Sunday . The following week , the last before Lent , is called Tyrinē ( Greek : Τυρινή , " cheese [ week ] " ) because meat is forbidden , although dairy products are not . Lent begins on " Clean Monday " , the day after " Cheese Sunday " . Throughout the Carnival season , people disguise themselves as maskarádes ( " masqueraders " ) and engage in pranks and revelry .
Before the attack on Pearl Harbor , the 800,000-member America First Committee vehemently opposed any American intervention in the European conflict , even as America sold military aid to Britain and the Soviet Union through the Lend-Lease program . Opposition to war in the U.S. vanished after the attack . On 8 December , the United States , the United Kingdom , Canada , and the Netherlands declared war on Japan , followed by China and Australia the next day . Four days after Pearl Harbor , Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declared war on the United States , drawing the country into a two-theater war . This is widely agreed to be a grand strategic blunder , as it abrogated the benefit Germany gained by Japan 's distraction of the U.S. ( predicted months before in a memo by Commander Arthur McCollum ) [ nb 12 ] and the reduction in aid to Britain , which both Congress and Hitler had managed to avoid during over a year of mutual provocation , which would otherwise have resulted .
During the Cenozoic era , specifically about 25 million years ago during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs , the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands . Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread . The grasslands provided a new niche for mammals , including many ungulates and glires , that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets . Traditionally , the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked . However , an examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open , gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes in mammals , giving rise to the " grit , not grass " hypothesis .
In 1928 , Nasser went to Alexandria to live with his maternal grandfather and attend the city 's Attarin elementary school . He left in 1929 for a private boarding school in Helwan , and later returned to Alexandria to enter the Ras el-Tin secondary school and to join his father , who was working for the city 's postal service . It was in Alexandria that Nasser became involved in political activism . After witnessing clashes between protesters and police in Manshia Square , he joined the demonstration without being aware of its purpose . The protest , organized by the ultranationalist Young Egypt Society , called for the end of colonialism in Egypt in the wake of the 1923 Egyptian constitution 's annulment by Prime Minister Isma'il Sidqi . Nasser was arrested and detained for a night before his father bailed him out .
But Amnesty International found no evidence that UNFPA had supported the coercion . A 2001 study conducted by the pro-life Population Research Institute ( PRI ) falsely claimed that the UNFPA shared an office with the Chinese family planning officials who were carrying out forced abortions . " We located the family planning offices , and in that family planning office , we located the UNFPA office , and we confirmed from family planning officials there that there is no distinction between what the UNFPA does and what the Chinese Family Planning Office does , " said Scott Weinberg , a spokesman for PRI . However , United Nations Members disagreed and approved UNFPA’s new country program me in January 2006 . The more than 130 members of the “Group of 77” developing countries in the United Nations expressed support for the UNFPA programmes . In addition , speaking for European democracies -- Norway , Denmark , Sweden , Finland , the Netherlands , France , Belgium , Switzerland and Germany -- the United Kingdom stated , ”UNFPA’s activities in China , as in the rest of the world , are in strict conformity with the unanimously adopted Programme of Action of the ICPD , and play a key role in supporting our common endeavor , the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.”
As a result of continued warming , the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert . In Eastern Antarctica , seed ferns or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time . Synapsids , commonly known as " mammal-like reptiles " , were common in Antarctica during the Early Triassic and included forms such as Lystrosaurus . The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the Jurassic period ( 206–146 Ma ) , and islands gradually rose out of the ocean . Ginkgo trees , conifers , bennettites , horsetails , ferns and cycads were plentiful during this period . In West Antarctica , coniferous forests dominated through the entire Cretaceous period ( 146–66 Ma ) , though southern beech became more prominent towards the end of this period . Ammonites were common in the seas around Antarctica , and dinosaurs were also present , though only three Antarctic dinosaur genera ( Cryolophosaurus and Glacialisaurus , from the Hanson Formation , and Antarctopelta ) have been described to date . It was during this era that Gondwana began to break up .
The writers of Grub Street , the Grub Street Hacks , were left feeling bitter about the relative success of the men of letters , and found an outlet for their literature which was typified by the libelle . Written mostly in the form of pamphlets , the libelles " slandered the court , the Church , the aristocracy , the academies , the salons , everything elevated and respectable , including the monarchy itself " . Le Gazetier cuirassé by Charles Théveneau de Morande was a prototype of the genre . It was Grub Street literature that was most read by the public during the Enlightenment . More importantly , according to Darnton , the Grub Street hacks inherited the " revolutionary spirit " once displayed by the philosophes , and paved the way for the French Revolution by desacralizing figures of political , moral and religious authority in France .
Many of Yale 's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931 , financed largely by Edward S. Harkness Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities such as a writer , an athlete , a tea-drinking socialite , and a student who has fallen asleep while reading . Similarly , the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute ( on the wall of the Law School ) , or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette . The architect , James Gamble Rogers , faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid , deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages , and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages . In fact , the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture , for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner , most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930 . One exception is Harkness Tower , 216 feet ( 66 m ) tall , which was originally a free-standing stone structure . It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon .
The son of an impoverished Bedouin goat herder , Gaddafi became involved in politics while at school in Sabha , subsequently enrolling in the Royal Military Academy , Benghazi . Founding a revolutionary cell within the military , in 1969 they seized power from the absolute monarchy of King Idris in a bloodless coup . Becoming Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council ( RCC ) , Gaddafi abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic . Ruling by decree , he implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya , and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments . Intent on pushing Libya towards " Islamic socialism " , he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system and nationalized the oil industry , using the increased revenues to bolster the military , implement social programs and fund revolutionary militants across the world . In 1973 he initiated a " Popular Revolution " with the formation of General People 's Committees ( GPCs ) , purported to be a system of direct democracy , but retained personal control over major decisions . He outlined his Third International Theory that year , publishing these ideas in The Green Book .
The Aeronautics Branch was renamed the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1934 to reflect its enhanced status within the Department . As commercial flying increased , the Bureau encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers for providing air traffic control ( ATC ) along the airways . In 1936 , the Bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the ATC system . The pioneer air traffic controllers used maps , blackboards , and mental calculations to ensure the safe separation of aircraft traveling along designated routes between cities .
Since playing Pong while filming Jaws in 1974 , Spielberg has been an avid video gamer . Spielberg played many of LucasArts adventure games , including the first Monkey Island games . He owns a Wii , a PlayStation 3 , a PSP , and Xbox 360 , and enjoys playing first-person shooters such as the Medal of Honor series and Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare . He has also criticized the use of cut scenes in games , calling them intrusive , and feels making story flow naturally into the gameplay is a challenge for future game developers .
Estonian ( eesti keel [ ˈeːsti ˈkeːl ] ( listen ) ) is the official language of Estonia , spoken natively by about 1.1 million people in Estonia and tens of thousands in various migrant communities . It belongs to the Finnic branch of the Uralic language family .
New or " virgin " heavy/heavyweight ( 180–220 g ) vinyl is commonly used for modern audiophile vinyl releases in all genres . Many collectors prefer to have heavyweight vinyl albums , which have been reported to have better sound than normal vinyl because of their higher tolerance against deformation caused by normal play . 180 g vinyl is more expensive to produce only because it uses more vinyl . Manufacturing processes are identical regardless of weight . In fact , pressing lightweight records requires more care . An exception is the propensity of 200 g pressings to be slightly more prone to non-fill , when the vinyl biscuit does not sufficiently fill a deep groove during pressing ( percussion or vocal amplitude changes are the usual locations of these artifacts ) . This flaw causes a grinding or scratching sound at the non-fill point .
Child labour is still common in many parts of the world . Estimates for child labour vary . It ranges between 250 and 304 million , if children aged 5–17 involved in any economic activity are counted . If light occasional work is excluded , ILO estimates there were 153 million child labourers aged 5–14 worldwide in 2008 . This is about 20 million less than ILO estimate for child labourers in 2004 . Some 60 percent of the child labour was involved in agricultural activities such as farming , dairy , fisheries and forestry . Another 25 percent of child labourers were in service activities such as retail , hawking goods , restaurants , load and transfer of goods , storage , picking and recycling trash , polishing shoes , domestic help , and other services . The remaining 15 percent laboured in assembly and manufacturing in informal economy , home-based enterprises , factories , mines , packaging salt , operating machinery , and such operations . Two out of three child workers work alongside their parents , in unpaid family work situations . Some children work as guides for tourists , sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants . Child labour predominantly occurs in the rural areas ( 70 % ) and informal urban sector ( 26 % ) .
Jim Foster , a promotions manager with the National Football League , conceived of indoor football while watching an indoor soccer match at Madison Square Garden in 1981 . While at the game , he wrote his idea on a 9x12 envelope , with sketches of the field and notes on gameplay . He presented the idea to a few friends at the NFL offices , where he received praise and encouragement for his concept . After solidifying the rules and a business plan , and supplemented with sketches by a professional artist , Foster presented his idea to various television networks . He reached an agreement with NBC for a " test game " .
Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture and from general purpose computers . They often feature thousands of CPUs , customized high-speed interconnects , and specialized computing hardware . Such designs tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once . Supercomputers usually see usage in large-scale simulation , graphics rendering , and cryptography applications , as well as with other so-called " embarrassingly parallel " tasks .
Although its PlayStation predecessors had been very dominant against the competition and were hugely profitable for Sony , PlayStation 3 had an inauspicious start , and Sony chairman and CEO Sir Howard Stringer initially could not convince investors of a turnaround in its fortunes . The PS3 lacked the unique gameplay of the more affordable Wii which became that generation 's most successful console in terms of units sold . Furthermore , PS3 had to compete directly with Xbox 360 which had a market head start , and as a result the platform no longer had exclusive titles that the PS2 enjoyed such as the Grand Theft Auto and Final Fantasy series ( regarding cross-platform games , Xbox 360 versions were generally considered superior in 2006 , although by 2008 the PS3 versions had reached parity or surpassed ) , and it took longer than expected for PS3 to enjoy strong sales and close the gap with Xbox 360 . Sony also continued to lose money on each PS3 sold through 2010 , although the redesigned " slim " PS3 has cut these losses since then .
Music is cherished in Boston . The Boston Symphony Orchestra is one of the " Big Five , " a group of the greatest American orchestras , and the classical music magazine Gramophone called it one of the " world 's best " orchestras . Symphony Hall ( located west of Back Bay ) is home to the Boston Symphony Orchestra , ( and the related Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra , which is the largest youth orchestra in the nation ) and the Boston Pops Orchestra . The British newspaper The Guardian called Boston Symphony Hall " one of the top venues for classical music in the world , " adding that " Symphony Hall in Boston was where science became an essential part of concert hall design . " Other concerts are held at the New England Conservatory 's Jordan Hall . The Boston Ballet performs at the Boston Opera House . Other performing-arts organizations located in the city include the Boston Lyric Opera Company , Opera Boston , Boston Baroque ( the first permanent Baroque orchestra in the US ) , and the Handel and Haydn Society ( one of the oldest choral companies in the United States ) . The city is a center for contemporary classical music with a number of performing groups , several of which are associated with the city 's conservatories and universities . These include the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Boston Musica Viva . Several theaters are located in or near the Theater District south of Boston Common , including the Cutler Majestic Theatre , Citi Performing Arts Center , the Colonial Theater , and the Orpheum Theatre .
In the 20th century after decades of intense warfare and political turmoil terms such as " Near East " , " Far East " and " Middle East " were relegated to the experts , especially in the new field of political science . The new wave of diplomats often came from those programs . Archaeology on the international scene , although very much of intellectual interest to the major universities , fell into the shadow of international relations . Their domain became the Ancient Near East , which could no longer be relied upon to be the Near East . The Ottoman Empire was gone , along with all the other empires of the 19th century , replaced with independent republics . Someone had to reconcile the present with the past . This duty was inherited by various specialized agencies that were formed to handle specific aspects of international relations , now so complex as to be beyond the scope and abilities of a diplomatic corps in the former sense . The ancient Near East is frozen in time . The living Near East is primarily what the agencies say it is . In most cases this single term is inadequate to describe the geographical range of their operations . The result is multiple definitions .
In 1972 , Walter Fiers and his team at the University of Ghent were the first to determine the sequence of a gene : the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 coat protein . The subsequent development of chain-termination DNA sequencing in 1977 by Frederick Sanger improved the efficiency of sequencing and turned it into a routine laboratory tool . An automated version of the Sanger method was used in early phases of the Human Genome Project .
Glaciers are present on every continent and approximately fifty countries , excluding those ( Australia , South Africa ) that have glaciers only on distant subantarctic island territories . Extensive glaciers are found in Antarctica , Chile , Canada , Alaska , Greenland and Iceland . Mountain glaciers are widespread , especially in the Andes , the Himalayas , the Rocky Mountains , the Caucasus , and the Alps . Mainland Australia currently contains no glaciers , although a small glacier on Mount Kosciuszko was present in the last glacial period . In New Guinea , small , rapidly diminishing , glaciers are located on its highest summit massif of Puncak Jaya . Africa has glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania , on Mount Kenya and in the Rwenzori Mountains . Oceanic islands with glaciers occur on Iceland , Svalbard , New Zealand , Jan Mayen and the subantarctic islands of Marion , Heard , Grande Terre ( Kerguelen ) and Bouvet . During glacial periods of the Quaternary , Taiwan , Hawaii on Mauna Kea and Tenerife also had large alpine glaciers , while the Faroe and Crozet Islands were completely glaciated .
Saint Helena was first settled by the English in 1659 , and the island has a population of about 4,250 inhabitants , mainly descended from people from Britain – settlers ( " planters " ) and soldiers – and slaves who were brought there from the beginning of settlement – initially from Africa ( the Cape Verde Islands , Gold Coast and west coast of Africa are mentioned in early records ) , then India and Madagascar . Eventually the planters felt there were too many slaves and no more were imported after 1792 .
Hogeschool is used in Belgium and in the Netherlands . The hogeschool has many similarities to the Fachhochschule in the German language areas and to the ammattikorkeakoulu in Finland .
New York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world by the diplomatic consulates of Iceland and Latvia and by New York 's Baruch College . A book containing a series of essays titled New York , culture capital of the world , 1940–1965 has also been published as showcased by the National Library of Australia . In describing New York , author Tom Wolfe said , " Culture just seems to be in the air , like part of the weather . "
After World War II , eastern European countries such as the Soviet Union , Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Romania and Yugoslavia expelled the Germans from their territories . Many of those had inhabited these lands for centuries , developing a unique culture . Germans were also forced to leave the former eastern territories of Germany , which were annexed by Poland ( Silesia , Pomerania , parts of Brandenburg and southern part of East Prussia ) and the Soviet Union ( northern part of East Prussia ) . Between 12 and 16,5 million ethnic Germans and German citizens were expelled westwards to allied-occupied Germany .
The islands were first sighted in 1506 by Portuguese explorer Tristão da Cunha ; rough seas prevented a landing . He named the main island after himself , Ilha de Tristão da Cunha , which was anglicised from its earliest mention on British Admiralty charts to Tristan da Cunha Island . Some sources state that the Portuguese made the first landing in 1520 , when the Lás Rafael captained by Ruy Vaz Pereira called at Tristan for water . The first undisputed landing was made in 1643 by the crew of the Heemstede , captained by Claes Gerritsz Bierenbroodspot .
Since Whitehead 's metaphysics described a universe in which all entities experience , he needed a new way of describing perception that was not limited to living , self-conscious beings . The term he coined was " prehension " , which comes from the Latin prehensio , meaning " to seize . " The term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious , applying to people as well as electrons . It is also intended to make clear Whitehead 's rejection of the theory of representative perception , in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities . For Whitehead , the term " prehension " indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself . In this way , entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations , rather than being independent of them . Further , Whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes , causal efficacy ( or " physical prehension " ) and presentational immediacy ( or " conceptual prehension " ) .

Mexico City remains the only Latin American city to host the Olympic Games , having held the Summer Olympics in 1968 , winning bids against Buenos Aires , Lyon and Detroit . ( This too will change thanks to Rio , 2016 Summer Games host ) . The city hosted the 1955 and 1975 Pan American Games , the last after Santiago and São Paulo withdrew . The ICF Flatwater Racing World Championships were hosted here in 1974 and 1994 . Lucha libre is a Mexican style of wrestling , and is one of the more popular sports throughout the country . The main venues in the city are Arena México and Arena Coliseo .
Also in 1931 , Hayek critiqued Keynes 's Treatise on Money ( 1930 ) in his " Reflections on the pure theory of Mr. J. M. Keynes " and published his lectures at the LSE in book form as Prices and Production . Unemployment and idle resources are , for Keynes , caused by a lack of effective demand ; for Hayek , they stem from a previous , unsustainable episode of easy money and artificially low interest rates . Keynes asked his friend Piero Sraffa to respond . Sraffa elaborated on the effect of inflation-induced " forced savings " on the capital sector and about the definition of a " natural " interest rate in a growing economy . Others who responded negatively to Hayek 's work on the business cycle included John Hicks , Frank Knight , and Gunnar Myrdal . Kaldor later wrote that Hayek 's Prices and Production had produced " a remarkable crop of critics " and that the total number of pages in British and American journals dedicated to the resulting debate " could rarely have been equalled in the economic controversies of the past . "
According to a 2011 projection by the International Energy Agency , solar power plants may produce most of the world 's electricity within 50 years , significantly reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment . The IEA has said : " Photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world 's demand for electricity by 2060 – and half of all energy needs – with wind , hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation " . " Photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity " .

London is home to many museums , galleries , and other institutions , many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role . The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury , in 1753 . Originally containing antiquities , natural history specimens and the national library , the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe . In 1824 the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings ; this now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square .
Pluralistic idealism such as that of Gottfried Leibniz takes the view that there are many individual minds that together underlie the existence of the observed world and make possible the existence of the physical universe . Unlike absolute idealism , pluralistic idealism does not assume the existence of a single ultimate mental reality or " Absolute " . Leibniz ' form of idealism , known as Panpsychism , views " monads " as the true atoms of the universe and as entities having perception . The monads are " substantial forms of being " , elemental , individual , subject to their own laws , non-interacting , each reflecting the entire universe . Monads are centers of force , which is substance while space , matter and motion are phenomenal and their form and existence is dependent on the simple and immaterial monads . There is a pre-established harmony established by God , the central monad , between the world in the minds of the monads and the external world of objects . Leibniz 's cosmology embraced traditional Christian Theism . The English psychologist and philosopher James Ward inspired by Leibniz had also defended a form of pluralistic idealism . According to Ward the universe is composed of " psychic monads " of different levels , interacting for mutual self- betterment .
Fighting on one side was a coalition of forces including the Republic of Vietnam ( South Vietnam or the " RVN " ) , the United States , supplemented by South Korea , Thailand , Australia , New Zealand , and the Philippines . The allies fought against the North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ) as well as the National Liberation Front ( NLF , also known as Viet communists Viet Cong ) , or " VC " , a guerrilla force within South Vietnam . The NVA received substantial military and economic aid from the Soviet Union and China , turning Vietnam into a proxy war .
Over time , Roman architecture was modified as their urban requirements changed , and the civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined . The Roman concrete has remained a riddle , and even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently . The architectural style of the capital city was emulated by other urban centers under Roman control and influence . Roman cities were well planned , efficiently managed and neatly maintained .

Some independent stereo manufacturers including JVC , Pioneer , Kenwood , Alpine , Sony , and Harman Kardon also have iPod-specific integration solutions . Alternative connection methods include adapter kits ( that use the cassette deck or the CD changer port ) , audio input jacks , and FM transmitters such as the iTrip—although personal FM transmitters are illegal in some countries . Many car manufacturers have added audio input jacks as standard .
Laird writes that the Ming appointed titles to eastern Tibetan princes , and that " these alliances with eastern Tibetan principalities are the evidence China now produces for its assertion that the Ming ruled Tibet , " despite the fact that the Ming did not send an army to replace the Mongols after they left Tibet . Yiu Yung-chin states that the furthest western extent of the Ming dynasty 's territory was Gansu , Sichuan , and Yunnan while " the Ming did not possess Tibet . "
One of the best known sporting events in the city is the Boston Marathon , the 26.2-mile ( 42.2 km ) race which is the world 's oldest annual marathon , run on Patriots ' Day in April . On April 15 , 2013 , two explosions killed three people and injured hundreds at the marathon . Another major annual event is the Head of the Charles Regatta , held in October .
When the Central Junta fell to the French , numerous new Juntas appeared all across the Americas , eventually resulting in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south , to Mexico in the north . After the death of the king Ferdinand VII , in 1833 , only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule , until the Spanish–American War in 1898 . Unlike the Spanish , the Portuguese did not divide their colonial territory in America . The captaincies they created were subdued to a centralized administration in Salvador ( later relocated to Rio de Janeiro ) which reported directly to the Portuguese Crown until its independence in 1822 , becoming the Empire of Brazil .
In 1963 , Egyptian director Youssef Chahine produced the film El Nasser Salah El Dine ( " Saladin The Victorious " ) , which intentionally drew parallels between Saladin , considered a hero in the Arab world , and Nasser and his pan-Arabist policies . Nasser is played by Ahmed Zaki in Mohamed Fadel 's 1996 Nasser 56 . The film set the Egyptian box office record at the time , and focused on Nasser during the Suez Crisis . It is also considered a milestone in Egyptian and Arab cinema as the first film to dramatize the role of a modern-day Arab leader . Together with the 1999 Syrian biopic Gamal Abdel Nasser , the films marked the first biographical movies about contemporary public figures produced in the Arab world .

In 1853 , Victoria gave birth to her eighth child , Leopold , with the aid of the new anaesthetic , chloroform . Victoria was so impressed by the relief it gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of her ninth and final child , Beatrice , despite opposition from members of the clergy , who considered it against biblical teaching , and members of the medical profession , who thought it dangerous . Victoria may have suffered from post-natal depression after many of her pregnancies . Letters from Albert to Victoria intermittently complain of her loss of self-control . For example , about a month after Leopold 's birth Albert complained in a letter to Victoria about her " continuance of hysterics " over a " miserable trifle " .
Oklahoma City is on the I-35 Corridor and is one of the primary travel corridors into neighboring Texas and Mexico . Located in the Frontier Country region of the state , the city 's northeast section lies in an ecological region known as the Cross Timbers . The city was founded during the Land Run of 1889 , and grew to a population of over 10,000 within hours of its founding . The city was the scene of the April 19 , 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building , in which 168 people died . It was the deadliest terror attack in the history of the United States until the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , and remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history .
For " closed systems " with no external source or sink of energy , the first law of thermodynamics states that a system 's energy is constant unless energy is transferred in or out by mechanical work or heat , and that no energy is lost in transfer . This means that it is impossible to create or destroy energy . While heat can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas , for cyclic processes of practical interest in heat engines the second law of thermodynamics states that the system doing work always loses some energy as waste heat . This creates a limit to the amount of heat energy that can do work in a cyclic process , a limit called the available energy . Mechanical and other forms of energy can be transformed in the other direction into thermal energy without such limitations . The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up all forms of energy in the system .
In early 2009 , Spielberg shot the first film in a planned trilogy of motion capture films based on The Adventures of Tintin , written by Belgian artist Hergé , with Peter Jackson . The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn , was not released until October 2011 , due to the complexity of the computer animation involved . The world premiere took place on October 22 , 2011 in Brussels , Belgium . The film was released in North American theaters on December 21 , 2011 , in Digital 3D and IMAX . It received generally positive reviews from critics , and grossed over $ 373 million worldwide . The Adventures of Tintin won the award for Best Animated Feature Film at the Golden Globe Awards that year . It is the first non-Pixar film to win the award since the category was first introduced . Jackson has been announced to direct the second film .
In June 2006 , Steven Spielberg announced he would direct a scientifically accurate film about " a group of explorers who travel through a worm hole and into another dimension " , from a treatment by Kip Thorne and producer Lynda Obst . In January 2007 , screenwriter Jonathan Nolan met with them to discuss adapting Obst and Thorne 's treatment into a narrative screenplay . The screenwriter suggested the addition of a " time element " to the treatment 's basic idea , which was welcomed by Obst and Thorne . In March of that year , Paramount hired Nolan , as well as scientists from Caltech , forming a workshop to adapt the treatment under the title Interstellar . The following July , Kip Thorne said there was a push by people for him to portray himself in the film . Spielberg later abandoned Interstellar , which was eventually directed by Christopher Nolan .
The Ming initiated sporadic armed intervention in Tibet during the 14th century , but did not garrison permanent troops there . At times the Tibetans also used armed resistance against Ming forays . The Wanli Emperor ( r. 1572–1620 ) made attempts to reestablish Sino-Tibetan relations after the Mongol-Tibetan alliance initiated in 1578 , which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent Qing dynasty ( 1644–1912 ) of China in their support for the Dalai Lama of the Gelug school . By the late 16th century , the Mongols were successful armed protectors of the Gelug Dalai Lama , after increasing their presence in the Amdo region . This culminated in Güshi Khan 's ( 1582–1655 ) conquest of Tibet from 1637–1642 and the establishment of the Ganden Phodrang regime by the 5th Dalai Lama with his help .
For centuries , various peoples in modern-day Nigeria traded overland with traders from North Africa . Cities in the area became regional centres in a broad network of trade routes that spanned western , central and northern Africa . In the 16th century , Spanish and Portuguese explorers were the first Europeans to begin significant , direct trade with peoples of modern-day Nigeria , at the port they named Lagos and in Calabar . Europeans traded goods with peoples at the coast ; coastal trade with Europeans also marked the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade . The port of Calabar on the historical Bight of Biafra ( now commonly referred to as the Bight of Bonny ) become one of the largest slave trading posts in West Africa in the era of the transatlantic slave trade . Other major slaving ports in Nigeria were located in Badagry , Lagos on the Bight of Benin and on Bonny Island on the Bight of Biafra . The majority of those enslaved and taken to these ports were captured in raids and wars . Usually the captives were taken back to the conquerors ' territory as forced labour ; after time , they were sometimes acculturated and absorbed into the conquerors ' society . A number of slave routes were established throughout Nigeria linking the hinterland areas with the major coastal ports . Some of the more prolific slave traders were linked with the Oyo Empire in the southwest , the Aro Confederacy in the southeast and the Sokoto Caliphate in the north .
The first Confederate soldier to be killed in the Civil War was Private Henry Wyatt from North Carolina , in the Battle of Big Bethel in June 1861 . At the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863 , the 26th North Carolina Regiment participated in Pickett/Pettigrew 's Charge and advanced the farthest into the Northern lines of any Confederate regiment . During the Battle of Chickamauga , the 58th North Carolina Regiment advanced farther than any other regiment on Snodgrass Hill to push back the remaining Union forces from the battlefield . At Appomattox Court House in Virginia in April 1865 , the 75th North Carolina Regiment , a cavalry unit , fired the last shots of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in the Civil War . For many years , North Carolinians proudly boasted that they had been " First at Bethel , Farthest at Gettysburg and Chickamauga , and Last at Appomattox . "
Others have argued that excessive regulation suppresses therapeutic innovation , and that the current cost of regulator-required clinical trials prevents the full exploitation of new genetic and biological knowledge for the treatment of human disease . A 2012 report by the President 's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology made several key recommendations to reduce regulatory burdens to new drug development , including 1 ) expanding the FDA 's use of accelerated approval processes , 2 ) creating an expedited approval pathway for drugs intended for use in narrowly defined populations , and 3 ) undertaking pilot projects designed to evaluate the feasibility of a new , adaptive drug approval process .
The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Florida was 20,271,272 on July 1 , 2015 , a 7.82 % increase since the 2010 United States Census . The population of Florida in the 2010 census was 18,801,310 . Florida was the seventh fastest-growing state in the U.S. in the 12-month period ending July 1 , 2012 . In 2010 , the center of population of Florida was located between Fort Meade and Frostproof . The center of population has moved less than 5 miles ( 8 km ) to the east and approximately 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) to the north between 1980 and 2010 and has been located in Polk County since the 1960 census . The population exceeded 19.7 million by December 2014 , surpassing the population of the state of New York for the first time .
After the American Revolutionary War , the number and proportion of free people of color increased markedly in the North and the South as slaves were freed . Most northern states abolished slavery , sometimes , like New York , in programs of gradual emancipation that took more than two decades to be completed . The last slaves in New York were not freed until 1827 . In connection with the Second Great Awakening , Quaker and Methodist preachers in the South urged slaveholders to free their slaves . Revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves , some by deed and others by will , so that from 1782 to 1810 , the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the South .
Classical immunology ties in with the fields of epidemiology and medicine . It studies the relationship between the body systems , pathogens , and immunity . The earliest written mention of immunity can be traced back to the plague of Athens in 430 BCE . Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time . Many other ancient societies have references to this phenomenon , but it was not until the 19th and 20th centuries before the concept developed into scientific theory .
Having small population size is a characteristic almost universally inherent to apex predators , humans and dogs by far the most blatant exceptions . Low numbers would n't be a problem for apex predators if there was an abundance of prey and no competition or niche overlap , a scenario that is rarely , if ever , encountered in the wild . The competitive exclusion principle states that if two species ' ecological niches overlap , there is a very high likelihood of competition as both species are in direct competition for the same resources . This factor alone could lead to the extirpation of one or both species , but is compounded by the added factor of prey abundance .
The prevalence of HIV-infection among the adult population is 1.8 % . Only 20 % of infected pregnant women receive anti retroviral coverage to prevent transmission to newborns .
Two groups G and H are called isomorphic if there exist group homomorphisms a : G → H and b : H → G , such that applying the two functions one after another in each of the two possible orders gives the identity functions of G and H. That is , a ( b ( h ) ) = h and b ( a ( g ) ) = g for any g in G and h in H. From an abstract point of view , isomorphic groups carry the same information . For example , proving that g • g = 1G for some element g of G is equivalent to proving that a ( g ) ∗ a ( g ) = 1H , because applying a to the first equality yields the second , and applying b to the second gives back the first .
The complete technical disclosure of the Columbia LP by Peter C. Goldmark , Rene ' Snepvangers and William S. Bachman in 1949 made it possible for a great variety of record companies to get into the business of making long playing records . The business grew quickly and interest spread in high fidelity sound and the do-it-yourself market for pickups , turntables , amplifier kits , loudspeaker enclosure plans , and AM/FM radio tuners . The LP record for longer works , 45 rpm for pop music , and FM radio became high fidelity program sources in demand . Radio listeners heard recordings broadcast and this in turn generated more record sales . The industry flourished .
Relations between Ashkenazim and Sephardim have not always been warm . North African Sepharadim and Berber Jews were often looked upon by Ashkenazim as second-class citizens during the first decade after the creation of Israel . This has led to protest movements such as the Israeli Black Panthers led by Saadia Marciano a Moroccan Jew . Nowadays , relations are getting better . In some instances , Ashkenazi communities have accepted significant numbers of Sephardi newcomers , sometimes resulting in intermarriage .
Beyoncé and husband Jay Z are friends with President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama . She performed " America the Beautiful " at the 2009 presidential inauguration , as well as " At Last " during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later . Beyoncé and Jay Z held a fundraiser at the latter 's 40/40 Club in Manhattan for Obama 's 2012 presidential campaign which raised $ 4 million . Beyoncé uploaded pictures of her paper ballot on Tumblr , confirming she had voted in support for the Democratic Party and to encourage others to do so . She also performed the American national anthem at his second inauguration , singing along with a pre-recorded track . She publicly endorsed same sex marriage on March 26 , 2013 , after the Supreme Court debate on California 's Proposition 8 . In July 2013 , Beyoncé and Jay-Z attended a rally in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting of Trayvon Martin .
Cambridge English Dictionary states that culture is , " the way of life , especially the general customs and beliefs , of a particular group of people at a particular time . " Terror Management Theory posits that culture is a series of activities and worldviews that provide humans with the illusion of being individuals of value in a world meaning—raising themselves above the merely physical aspects of existence , in order to deny the animal insignificance and death that Homo Sapiens became aware of when they acquired a larger brain .
The Battle of Wörth ( also known as Fröschwiller or Reichshoffen ) began when the two armies clashed again on 6 August near Wörth in the town of Fröschwiller , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from Wissembourg . The Crown Prince of Prussia 's 3rd army had , on the quick reaction of his Chief of Staff General von Blumenthal , drawn reinforcements which brought its strength up to 140,000 troops . The French had been slowly reinforced and their force numbered only 35,000 . Although badly outnumbered , the French defended their position just outside Fröschwiller . By afternoon , the Germans had suffered c. 10,500 killed or wounded and the French had lost a similar number of casualties and another c. 9,200 men taken prisoner , a loss of about 50 % . The Germans captured Fröschwiller which sat on a hilltop in the centre of the French line . Having lost any hope for victory and facing a massacre , the French army disengaged and retreated in a westerly direction towards Bitche and Saverne , hoping to join French forces on the other side of the Vosges mountains . The German 3rd army did not pursue the French but remained in Alsace and moved slowly south , attacking and destroying the French garrisons in the vicinity .
Theravadin Buddhists believe that personal effort is required to realize rebirth . Monks follow the vinaya : meditating , teaching and serving their lay communities . Laypersons can perform good actions , producing merit .
On November 12 , the league announced the defending champion San Jose SaberCats would be ceasing operations due to " reasons unrelated to League operations " . A statement from the league indicated that the AFL is working to secure new , long-term owners for the franchise . This leaves the AFL with eight teams for 2016 .
Publius Vergilius Maro ( Classical Latin : [ ˈpuː.blɪ.ʊs wɛrˈɡɪ.lɪ.ʊs ˈma.roː ] ; October 15 , 70 BC – September 21 , 19 BC ) , usually called Virgil or Vergil /ˈvɜːrdʒᵻl/ in English , was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period . He is known for three major works of Latin literature , the Eclogues ( or Bucolics ) , the Georgics , and the epic Aeneid . A number of minor poems , collected in the Appendix Vergiliana , are sometimes attributed to him .
Seattle annually sends a team of spoken word slammers to the National Poetry Slam and considers itself home to such performance poets as Buddy Wakefield , two-time Individual World Poetry Slam Champ ; Anis Mojgani , two-time National Poetry Slam Champ ; and Danny Sherrard , 2007 National Poetry Slam Champ and 2008 Individual World Poetry Slam Champ . Seattle also hosted the 2001 national Poetry Slam Tournament . The Seattle Poetry Festival is a biennial poetry festival that ( launched first as the Poetry Circus in 1997 ) has featured local , regional , national , and international names in poetry .
After the Peace of Westphalia , several border territories were assigned to the United Provinces . They were federally-governed Generality Lands ( Generaliteitslanden ) . They were Staats-Brabant ( present North Brabant ) , Staats-Vlaanderen ( present Zeeuws-Vlaanderen ) , Staats-Limburg ( around Maastricht ) and Staats-Oppergelre ( around Venlo , after 1715 ) .
Wood has always been used extensively for furniture , such as chairs and beds . It is also used for tool handles and cutlery , such as chopsticks , toothpicks , and other utensils , like the wooden spoon .
Religious beliefs in the Eastern Empire and Persia were in flux during the late 6th and early 7th centuries . Judaism was an active proselytising faith , and at least one Arab political leader converted to it . [ J ] Christianity had active missions competing with the Persians ' Zoroastrianism in seeking converts , especially among residents of the Arabian Peninsula . All these strands came together with the emergence of Islam in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad ( d. 632 ) . After his death , Islamic forces conquered much of the Eastern Empire and Persia , starting with Syria in 634–635 and reaching Egypt in 640–641 , Persia between 637 and 642 , North Africa in the later 7th century , and the Iberian Peninsula in 711 . By 714 , Islamic forces controlled much of the peninsula in a region they called Al-Andalus .
Strict separation of powers did not operate in The United Kingdom , the political structure of which served in most instances [ citation needed ] as a model for the government created by the U.S . Constitution . [ citation needed ] Under the UK Westminster system , based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government , Parliament ( consisting of the Sovereign ( King-in-Parliament ) , House of Lords and House of Commons ) was the supreme lawmaking authority . The executive branch acted in the name of the King ( " His Majesty 's Government " ) , as did the judiciary . The King 's Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament , and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons . One minister , the Lord Chancellor , was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords . Therefore , it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers , even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other . Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century . In New Jersey , the Governor also functioned as a member of the state 's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature . The President of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals ; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as Vice Presidents . In both Delaware and Pennsylvania , members of the executive council served at the same time as judges . On the other hand , many southern states explicitly required separation of powers . Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina and Georgia all kept the branches of government " separate and distinct . "
In 1839 , Melbourne resigned after Radicals and Tories ( both of whom Victoria detested ) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of Jamaica . The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery . The Queen commissioned a Tory , Sir Robert Peel , to form a new ministry . At the time , it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household , who were usually his political allies and their spouses . Many of the Queen 's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs , and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories . In what became known as the bedchamber crisis , Victoria , advised by Melbourne , objected to their removal . Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen , and consequently resigned his commission , allowing Melbourne to return to office .
Zen Buddhist teaching is often full of paradox , in order to loosen the grip of the ego and to facilitate the penetration into the realm of the True Self or Formless Self , which is equated with the Buddha himself . [ note 14 ] According to Zen master Kosho Uchiyama , when thoughts and fixation on the little " I " are transcended , an Awakening to a universal , non-dual Self occurs : " When we let go of thoughts and wake up to the reality of life that is working beyond them , we discover the Self that is living universal non-dual life ( before the separation into two ) that pervades all living creatures and all existence . " Thinking and thought must therefore not be allowed to confine and bind one .
His first professional TV job came when he was hired to direct one of the segments for the 1969 pilot episode of Night Gallery . The segment , " Eyes , " starred Joan Crawford ; she and Spielberg were reportedly close friends until her death . The episode is unusual in his body of work , in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later , more " mature " films . After this , and an episode of Marcus Welby , M.D. , Spielberg got his first feature-length assignment : an episode of The Name of the Game called " L.A. 2017 " . This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract . He did another segment on Night Gallery and did some work for shows such as Owen Marshall : Counselor at Law and The Psychiatrist , before landing the first series episode of Columbo ( previous episodes were actually TV films ) .
Winston Churchill , on forming his government in 1940 , created the office of Minister of Defence to exercise ministerial control over the Chiefs of Staff Committee and to co-ordinate defence matters . The post was held by the Prime Minister of the day until Clement Attlee 's government introduced the Ministry of Defence Act of 1946 . The new ministry was headed by a Minister of Defence who possessed a seat in the Cabinet . The three existing service Ministers—the Secretary of State for War , the First Lord of the Admiralty , and the Secretary of State for Air—remained in direct operational control of their respective services , but ceased to attend Cabinet .
Usually , the short-term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short-term interest rate target . In other instances , monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold . For example , in the case of the United States the Federal Reserve targets the federal funds rate , the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight . The other primary means of conducting monetary policy include : ( i ) Discount window lending ( as lender of last resort ) ; ( ii ) Fractional deposit lending ( changes in the reserve requirement ) ; ( iii ) Moral suasion ( cajoling certain market players to achieve specified outcomes ) ; ( iv ) " Open mouth operations " ( talking monetary policy with the market ) .
The Crimean War ( 1853–1856 ) was part of a long-running contest between the major European powers for influence over territories of the declining Ottoman Empire . The financial burden of the war led the Ottoman state to issue foreign loans amounting to 5 million pounds sterling on 4 August 1854 . The war caused an exodus of the Crimean Tatars , about 200,000 of whom moved to the Ottoman Empire in continuing waves of emigration . Toward the end of the Caucasian Wars , 90 % of the Circassians were ethnically cleansed and exiled from their homelands in the Caucasus and fled to the Ottoman Empire , resulting in the settlement of 500,000 to 700,000 Circassians in Turkey . [ page needed ] Some Circassian organisations give much higher numbers , totaling 1–1.5 million deported or killed .
A dense wave of smog began in the Central and Eastern part of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 kilometres ( 750 mi ) , including Tianjin , Hebei , Shandong , Jiangsu , Anhui , Shanghai and Zhejiang . A lack of cold air flow , combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions , collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region . The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province , especially in and around Nanjing , with its AQI pollution Index at " severely polluted " for five straight days and " heavily polluted " for nine . On 3 December 2013 , levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic metre , falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic metre on 4 December 2013 . Between 3:00 pm , 3 December and 2:00pm , 4 December local time , several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed , stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station . From 5 to 6 December , Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools . Children 's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent ; general incidence of bronchitis , pneumonia , upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased . The smog dissipated 12 December . Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind , automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure , and coal-powered district heating system in North China region . Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions ( mostly SO2 ) towards China 's east coast .
Some definitions of southern Europe , also known as Mediterranean Europe , include the countries of the Iberian peninsula ( Spain and Portugal ) , the Italian peninsula , southern France and Greece . Other definitions sometimes include the Balkan countries of southeast Europe , which are geographically in the southern part of Europe , but which have different historical , political , economic , and cultural backgrounds .
During the later stages of World War II , the entire Cold War , and to a lesser extent afterwards , uranium-235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons . Initially , two major types of fission bombs were built : a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238 . Later , a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb ( thermonuclear weapon ) was built , that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion . Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile ( unenriched ) uranium case , and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process .
Ronald Inden writes that by the 8th century CE symbols of Hindu gods " replaced the Buddha at the imperial centre and pinnacle of the cosmo-political system , the image or symbol of the Hindu god comes to be housed in a monumental temple and given increasingly elaborate imperial-style puja worship " . Although Buddhism did not disappear from India for several centuries after the eighth , royal proclivities for the cults of Vishnu and Shiva weakened Buddhism 's position within the sociopolitical context and helped make possible its decline .
Westminster Abbey , formally titled the Collegiate Church of St Peter at Westminster , is a large , mainly Gothic abbey church in the City of Westminster , London , located just to the west of the Palace of Westminster . It is one of the most notable religious buildings in the United Kingdom and has been the traditional place of coronation and burial site for English and , later , British monarchs . Between 1540 and 1556 the abbey had the status of a cathedral . Since 1560 , however , the building is no longer an abbey nor a cathedral , having instead the status of a Church of England " Royal Peculiar " —a church responsible directly to the sovereign . The building itself is the original abbey church .
Concurrently , the Somali Transitional Federal Government began preparations to revive the national postal service . The government 's overall reconstruction plan for Somali Post is structured into three Phases spread out over a period of ten years . Phase I will see the reconstruction of the postal headquarters and General Post Office ( GPO ) , as well as the establishment of 16 branch offices in the capital and 17 in regional bases . As of March 2012 , the Somali authorities have re-established Somalia 's membership with the Universal Postal Union ( UPU ) , and taken part once again in the Union 's affairs . They have also rehabilitated the GPO in Mogadishu , and appointed an official Postal Consultant to provide professional advice on the renovations . Phase II of the rehabilitation project involves the construction of 718 postal outlets from 2014 to 2016 . Phase III is slated to begin in 2017 , with the objective of creating 897 postal outlets by 2022 .
Once food leaves the crop , it passes to the midgut ( element 13 in numbered diagram ) , also known as the mesenteron , where the majority of digestion takes place . Microscopic projections from the midgut wall , called microvilli , increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed ; they tend to be close to the origin of the midgut . In some insects , the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary . For example , specialized microvilli producing digestive enzymes may more likely be near the end of the midgut , and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut . :32
The area north of the Congo River came under French sovereignty in 1880 as a result of Pierre de Brazza 's treaty with Makoko of the Bateke . This Congo Colony became known first as French Congo , then as Middle Congo in 1903 . In 1908 , France organized French Equatorial Africa ( AEF ) , comprising Middle Congo , Gabon , Chad , and Oubangui-Chari ( the modern Central African Republic ) . The French designated Brazzaville as the federal capital . Economic development during the first 50 years of colonial rule in Congo centered on natural-resource extraction . The methods were often brutal : construction of the Congo–Ocean Railroad following World War I has been estimated to have cost at least 14,000 lives .
The Royal Assent ceremony takes place in the Senate , as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons . On the day of the event , the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive . The Senate thereafter can not adjourn until after the ceremony . The speaker moves to sit beside the throne , the Mace Bearer , with mace in hand , stands adjacent to him or her , and the governor general enters to take the speaker 's chair . The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament , who follow Black Rod back to the Senate , the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons . In the Senate , those from the commons stand behind the bar , while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general , who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills ( which do not include appropriations bills ) . Once the list of bills is complete , the Clerk of the Senate states : " in Her Majesty 's name , His [ or Her ] Excellency the Governor General [ or the deputy ] doth assent to these bills . " If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent , the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general , who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent . When these bills have all been assented to , the Clerk of the Senate recites " in Her Majesty 's name , His [ or Her ] Excellency the Governor General [ or the deputy ] thanks her loyal subjects , accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills . The governor general or his or her deputy then depart parliament .
BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams . Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011 . Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference . All teams are named the " Cougars " , and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school 's mascot since 1953 . The school 's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song . Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years ( men when they 're 18 , women when 19 ) , BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools ' players . The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period . This has caused minor controversy , but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage , since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions . BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday , as well as expelling players due to honor code violations . Beginning in the 2011 season , BYU football competes in college football as an independent . In addition , most other sports now compete in the West Coast Conference . Teams in swimming and diving and indoor track and field for both men and women joined the men 's volleyball program in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation . For outdoor track and field , the Cougars became an Independent . Softball returned to the Western Athletic Conference , but spent only one season in the WAC ; the team moved to the Pacific Coast Softball Conference after the 2012 season . The softball program may move again after the 2013 season ; the July 2013 return of Pacific to the WCC will enable that conference to add softball as an official sport .
Railways must operate at variable speeds . Until the mid 1980s this was only practical with the brush-type DC motor , although such DC can be supplied from an AC catenary via on-board electric power conversion . Since such conversion was not well developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century , most early electrified railways used DC and many still do , particularly rapid transit ( subways ) and trams . Speed was controlled by connecting the traction motors in various series-parallel combinations , by varying the traction motors ' fields , and by inserting and removing starting resistances to limit motor current .
Present-day Christian religious bodies known for conducting their worship services without musical accompaniment include some Presbyterian churches devoted to the regulative principle of worship , Old Regular Baptists , Primitive Baptists , Plymouth Brethren , Churches of Christ , the Old German Baptist Brethren , Doukhobors the Byzantine Rite and the Amish , Old Order Mennonites and Conservative Mennonites . Certain high church services and other musical events in liturgical churches ( such as the Roman Catholic Mass and the Lutheran Divine Service ) may be a cappella , a practice remaining from apostolic times . Many Mennonites also conduct some or all of their services without instruments . Sacred Harp , a type of folk music , is an a cappella style of religious singing with shape notes , usually sung at singing conventions .
Integral to the story of the origin of the name " Antarctica " is how it was not named Terra Australis—this name was given to Australia instead , and it was because of a mistake made by people who decided that a significant landmass would not be found farther south than Australia . Explorer Matthew Flinders , in particular , has been credited with popularizing the transfer of the name Terra Australis to Australia . He justified the titling of his book A Voyage to Terra Australis ( 1814 ) by writing in the introduction :
The presence of pain in an animal can not be known for certain , but it can be inferred through physical and behavioral reactions . Specialists currently believe that all vertebrates can feel pain , and that certain invertebrates , like the octopus , might too . As for other animals , plants , or other entities , their ability to feel physical pain is at present a question beyond scientific reach , since no mechanism is known by which they could have such a feeling . In particular , there are no known nociceptors in groups such as plants , fungi , and most insects , except for instance in fruit flies .
Many scripts , including Arabic and Devanagari , have special orthographic rules that require certain combinations of letterforms to be combined into special ligature forms . The rules governing ligature formation can be quite complex , requiring special script-shaping technologies such as ACE ( Arabic Calligraphic Engine by DecoType in the 1980s and used to generate all the Arabic examples in the printed editions of the Unicode Standard ) , which became the proof of concept for OpenType ( by Adobe and Microsoft ) , Graphite ( by SIL International ) , or AAT ( by Apple ) .
20th Street starts at Avenue C , and 21st and 22nd Streets begin at First Avenue . They all end at Eleventh Avenue . Travel on the last block of the 20th , 21st and 22nd Streets , between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues , is in the opposite direction than it is on the rest of the respective street . 20th Street is very wide from the Avenue C to First Avenue .
In November 2013 MGM and the McClory estate formally settled the issue with Danjaq , LLC—sister company of Eon Productions—with MGM acquiring the full copyright film rights to the concept of Spectre and all of the characters associated with it . With the acquisition of the film rights and the organisation 's re-introduction to the series ' continuity , the SPECTRE acronym was discarded and the organisation reimagined as " Spectre " .
The Kakatiya dynasty was reduced to a vassal of the Khilji dynasty in 1310 after its defeat by Sultan Alauddin Khilji of the Delhi Sultanate . This lasted until 1321 , when the Kakatiya dynasty was annexed by Malik Kafur , Allaudin Khilji 's general . During this period , Alauddin Khilji took the Koh-i-Noor diamond , which is said to have been mined from the Kollur Mines of Golkonda , to Delhi . Muhammad bin Tughluq succeeded to the Delhi sultanate in 1325 , bringing Warangal under the rule of the Tughlaq dynasty until 1347 when Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah , a governor under bin Tughluq , rebelled against Delhi and established the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan Plateau , with Gulbarga , 200 km ( 124 mi ) west of Hyderabad , as its capital . The Bahmani kings ruled the region until 1518 and were the first independent Muslim rulers of the Deccan .
Computer security , also known as cybersecurity or IT security , is the protection of information systems from theft or damage to the hardware , the software , and to the information on them , as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide . It includes controlling physical access to the hardware , as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access , data and code injection , and due to malpractice by operators , whether intentional , accidental , or due to them being tricked into deviating from secure procedures .
The city 's Greektown and three downtown casino resort hotels serve as part of an entertainment hub . The Eastern Market farmer 's distribution center is the largest open-air flowerbed market in the United States and has more than 150 foods and specialty businesses . On Saturdays , about 45,000 people shop the city 's historic Eastern Market . The Midtown and the New Center area are centered on Wayne State University and Henry Ford Hospital . Midtown has about 50,000 residents and attracts millions of visitors each year to its museums and cultural centers ; for example , the Detroit Festival of the Arts in Midtown draws about 350,000 people .
While the incumbents of some sees are regularly made cardinals , and some countries are entitled to at least one cardinal by concordate ( usually earning its primate the cardinal 's hat ) , no see carries an actual right to the cardinalate , not even if its bishop is a Patriarch .
The synthesis of urea by Friedrich Wöhler opened a new research field , organic chemistry , and by the end of the 19th century , scientists were able to synthesize hundreds of organic compounds . The later part of the 19th century saw the exploitation of the Earth 's petrochemicals , after the exhaustion of the oil supply from whaling . By the 20th century , systematic production of refined materials provided a ready supply of products which provided not only energy , but also synthetic materials for clothing , medicine , and everyday disposable resources . Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in physiological chemistry , the precursor to biochemistry . The 20th century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry , with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom . Linus Pauling 's book on The Nature of the Chemical Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond angles in ever-more complicated molecules . Pauling 's work culminated in the physical modelling of DNA , the secret of life ( in the words of Francis Crick , 1953 ) . In the same year , the Miller–Urey experiment demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes , that basic constituents of proteins , simple amino acids , could themselves be built up from simpler molecules .
On 11 June 2009 , four Uyghurs who had been held in the United States Guantánamo Bay detention camp , in Cuba , were transferred to Bermuda . The four men were among 22 Uyghurs who claimed to be refugees , who were captured in 2001 in Pakistan after fleeing the American aerial bombardment of Afghanistan . They were accused of training to assist the Taliban 's military . They were cleared as safe for release from Guantánamo in 2005 or 2006 , but US domestic law prohibited deporting them back to China , their country of citizenship , because the US government determined that China was likely to violate their human rights .
In his role as god of prophecy and truth , Apollo had the epithets Manticus ( /ˈmæntᵻkəs/ MAN-ti-kəs ; Μαντικός , Mantikos , literally " prophetic " ) , Leschenorius ( /ˌlɛskᵻˈnɔəriəs/ LES-ki-NOHR-ee-əs ; Λεσχηνόριος , Leskhēnorios , from λεσχήνωρ , " converser " ) , and Loxias ( /ˈlɒksiəs/ LOK-see-əs ; Λοξίας , Loxias , from λέγειν , " to say " ) . The epithet " Loxias " has historically been associated with λοξός , " ambiguous " . In this respect , the Romans called him Coelispex ( /ˈsɛlᵻspɛks/ SEL-i-speks ; from Latin coelum , " sky " , and specere , " to look at " ) . The epithet Iatromantis ( /aɪˌætrəˈmæntɪs/ eye-AT-rə-MAN-tis ; Ἰατρομάντις , Iātromantis , from ἰατρός , " physician " , and μάντις , " prophet " ) refers to both his role as a god of healing and of prophecy . As god of music and arts , Apollo had the epithet Musagetes ( /mjuːˈsædʒᵻtiːz/ mew-SAJ-i-teez ; Doric Μουσαγέτας , Mousāgetās ) or Musegetes ( /mjuːˈsɛdʒᵻtiːz/ mew-SEJ-i-teez ; Μουσηγέτης , Mousēgetēs , from Μούσα , " Muse " , and ἡγέτης , " leader " ) .
Stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers , optical scanners , and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element , the print head carriage ( of dot matrix and inkjet printers ) , and the platen or feed rollers . Likewise , many computer plotters ( which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers ) used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement ; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems .
Nigeria has also been pervaded by political corruption . It was ranked 143 out of 182 countries in Transparency International 's 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index ; however , it improved to 136th position in 2014 . More than $ 400 billion were stolen from the treasury by Nigeria 's leaders between 1960 and 1999 . In late 2013 , Nigeria 's then central bank governor Lamido Sanusi informed President Goodluck Jonathan that the state oil company , NNPC had failed to remit US $ 20 billion of oil revenues , which it owed the state . Jonathan however dismissed the claim and replaced Sanusi for his mismanagement of the central bank 's budget . A Senate committee also found Sanusi’s account to be lacking substance . After the conclusion of the NNPC 's account Audit , it was announced in January 2015 that NNPC 's non-remitted revenue is actually US $ 1.48billion , which it needs to refund back to the Government .
While the largest European-American population in Montana overall is German , pockets of significant Scandinavian ancestry are prevalent in some of the farming-dominated northern and eastern prairie regions , parallel to nearby regions of North Dakota and Minnesota . Farmers of Irish , Scots , and English roots also settled in Montana . The historically mining-oriented communities of western Montana such as Butte have a wider range of European-American ethnicity ; Finns , Eastern Europeans and especially Irish settlers left an indelible mark on the area , as well as people originally from British mining regions such as Cornwall , Devon and Wales . The nearby city of Helena , also founded as a mining camp , had a similar mix in addition to a small Chinatown . Many of Montana 's historic logging communities originally attracted people of Scottish , Scandinavian , Slavic , English and Scots-Irish descent . [ citation needed ]
Later , the constitution was amended to state that the citizens of the 16 states had successfully achieved the unity of Germany in free self-determination and that the Basic Law thus applied to the entire German people . Article 23 , which had allowed " any other parts of Germany " to join , was rephrased . It had been used in 1957 to reintegrate the Saar Protectorate as the Saarland into the Federal Republic , and this was used as a model for German reunification in 1990 . The amended article now defines the participation of the Federal Council and the 16 German states in matters concerning the European Union .
Over 90 weeklies , fortnightlies and quarterlies are published in Sanskrit . Sudharma , a daily newspaper in Sanskrit , has been published out of Mysore , India , since 1970 , while Sanskrit Vartman Patram and Vishwasya Vrittantam started in Gujarat during the last five years . Since 1974 , there has been a short daily news broadcast on state-run All India Radio . These broadcasts are also made available on the internet on AIR 's website . Sanskrit news is broadcast on TV and on the internet through the DD National channel at 6:55 AM IST .
Agriculture and forestry have declined in importance over the decades . Nevertheless , they are more important than in the most other areas of Germany , especially within rural regions . 54 % of Thuringia 's territory is in agricultural use . The fertile basins such as the large Thuringian Basin or the smaller Goldene Aue , Orlasenke and Osterland are in intensive use for growing cereals , vegetables , fruits and energy crops . Important products are apples , strawberries , cherries and plums in the fruit sector , cabbage , potatoes , cauliflower , tomatoes ( grown in greenhouses ) , onions , cucumbers and asparagus in the vegetable sector , as well as maize , rapeseed , wheat , barley and sugar beets in the crop sector .
Several Americans , especially Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson , played a major role in bringing Enlightenment ideas to the New World and in influencing British and French thinkers . Franklin was influential for his political activism and for his advances in physics . The cultural exchange during the Age of Enlightenment ran in both directions across the Atlantic . Thinkers such as Paine , Locke , and Rousseau all take Native American cultural practices as examples of natural freedom . The Americans closely followed English and Scottish political ideas , as well as some French thinkers such as Montesquieu . As deists , they were influenced by ideas of John Toland ( 1670–1722 ) and Matthew Tindal ( 1656–1733 ) . During the Enlightenment there was a great emphasis upon liberty , democracy , republicanism and religious tolerance . Attempts to reconcile science and religion resulted in a widespread rejection of prophecy , miracle and revealed religion in preference for Deism – especially by Thomas Paine in The Age of Reason and by Thomas Jefferson in his short Jefferson Bible – from which all supernatural aspects were removed .
James Liebman , a professor of law at Columbia Law School , stated in 1996 that his study found that when habeas corpus petitions in death penalty cases were traced from conviction to completion of the case that there was " a 40 percent success rate in all capital cases from 1978 to 1995 . " Similarly , a study by Ronald Tabak in a law review article puts the success rate in habeas corpus cases involving death row inmates even higher , finding that between " 1976 and 1991 , approximately 47 percent of the habeas petitions filed by death row inmates were granted . " The different numbers are largely definitional , rather than substantive . Freedam 's statistics looks at the percentage of all death penalty cases reversed , while the others look only at cases not reversed prior to habeas corpus review .
On April 26 , 1988 , about 500 people participated in a march organized by the Ukrainian Cultural Club on Kiev 's Khreschatyk Street to mark the second anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster , carrying placards with slogans like " Openness and Democracy to the End . " Between May and June 1988 , Ukrainian Catholics in western Ukraine celebrated the Millennium of Christianity in Kievan Rus ' in secret by holding services in the forests of Buniv , Kalush , Hoshiv , and Zarvanytsia . On June 5 , 1988 , as the official celebrations of the Millennium were held in Moscow , the Ukrainian Cultural Club hosted its own observances in Kiev at the monument to St. Volodymyr the Great , the grand prince of Kievan Rus ' .
In 2006 , Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service . Issues included call transfers of more than 45 % of calls and long wait times . Dell 's blog detailed the response : " We 're spending more than a $ 100 million — and a lot of blood , sweat and tears of talented people — to fix this . " Later in the year , the company increased its spending on customer service to $ 150 million . Despite significant investment in this space , Dell continues to face public scrutiny with even the company 's own website littered with complaints regarding the issue escalation process .

With the Japanese CAP out of position and the carriers at their most vulnerable , SBD Dauntlesses from Enterprise and Yorktown appeared at an altitude of 10,000 feet ( 3,000 m ) and commenced their attack , quickly dealing fatal blows to three fleet carriers : Sōryū , Kaga , and Akagi . Within minutes , all three were ablaze and had to be abandoned with great loss of life . Hiryū managed to survive the wave of dive bombers and launched a counter-attack against the American carriers which caused severe damage to Yorktown ( which was later finished off by a Japanese submarine ) . However , a second attack from the U.S. carriers a few hours later found and destroyed Hiryū , the last remaining fleet carrier available to Nagumo . With his carriers lost and the Americans withdrawn out of range of his powerful battleships , Yamamoto was forced to call off the operation , leaving Midway in American hands . The battle proved to be a decisive victory for the Allies . For the second time , Japanese expansion had been checked and its formidable Combined Fleet was significantly weakened by the loss of four fleet carriers and many highly trained , virtually irreplaceable , personnel . Japan would be largely on the defensive for the rest of the war .
In the Islamic tradition , Mary and Jesus were the only children who could not be touched by Satan at the moment of their birth , for God imposed a veil between them and Satan . According to author Shabbir Akhtar , the Islamic perspective on Mary 's Immaculate Conception is compatible with the Catholic doctrine of the same topic . " O People of the Book ! Do not go beyond the bounds in your religion , and do not say anything of Allah but the truth . The Messiah , Jesus son of Mary , was but a Messenger of God , and a Word of His ( Power ) which He conveyed to Mary , and a spirit from Him . So believe in Allah ( as the One , Unique God ) , and His Messengers ( including Jesus , as Messenger ) ; and do not say : ( Allah is one of ) a trinity . Give up ( this assertion ) â€ " ( it is ) for your own good ( to do so ) . Allah is but One Allah ; All-Glorified He is in that He is absolutely above having a son . To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth . And Allah suffices as the One to be relied on , to Whom affairs should be referred . " Quran 4/171
Since the start of the 1994–95 season , the FA Cup has been sponsored . However , to protect the identity of the competition , the sponsored name has always included 'The FA Cup ' in addition to the sponsor 's name , unlike sponsorship deals for the League Cup where the word 'cup ' is preceded by only the sponsor 's name . Sponsorship deals run for four years , though – as in the case of E.ON – one-year extensions may be agreed . Emirates airline is the sponsor from 2015 to 2018 , renaming the competition as 'The Emirates FA Cup ' , unlike previous editions , which included 'The FA Cup in association with E.ON ' and 'The FA Cup with Budweiser ' .
International observers of Council of Europe and US Department of State have questioned the fairness of Armenia 's parliamentary and presidential elections and constitutional referendum since 1995 , citing polling deficiencies , lack of cooperation by the Electoral Commission , and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places . Freedom House categorized Armenia in its 2008 report as a " Semi-consolidated Authoritarian Regime " ( along with Moldova , Kosovo , Kyrgyzstan , and Russia ) and ranked Armenia 20th among 29 nations in transition , with a Democracy Score of 5.21 out of 7 ( 7 represents the lowest democratic progress ) .
Sometime after the publication of the Eclogues ( probably before 37 BC ) , Virgil became part of the circle of Maecenas , Octavian 's capable agent d'affaires who sought to counter sympathy for Antony among the leading families by rallying Roman literary figures to Octavian 's side . Virgil came to know many of the other leading literary figures of the time , including Horace , in whose poetry he is often mentioned , and Varius Rufus , who later helped finish the Aeneid .
Microsoft Windows 3.0 was released in May 1990 , and according to a common saying at the time " Windows was not as good as Macintosh , but it was good enough for the average user " . Though still a graphical wrapper that relied upon MS-DOS , 3.0 was the first iteration of Windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the much more expensive Macintosh platform . It also did not help matters that during the previous year Jean-Louis Gassée had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers . Finally , there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding PC industry in 1989 , forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices which dropped Apple 's margins .
In ordinary circumstances , transduction , conjugation , and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species , but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences , such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance . In such cases , gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions . Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens .
West of Fort Washington Avenue , 181st Street is largely residential , bordering Hudson Heights and having a few shops to serve the local residents . East of Fort Washington Avenue , the street becomes increasingly commercial , becoming dominated entirely by retail stores where the street reaches Broadway and continues as such until reaching the Harlem River . It is the area 's major shopping district .
World War I was a watershed event in human history , changing views of governments and politics . The Russian Revolution of 1917 ( and similar , albeit less successful , revolutions in many other European countries ) brought communism - and in particular the political theory of Leninism , but also on a smaller level Luxemburgism ( gradually ) - on the world stage . At the same time , social democratic parties won elections and formed governments for the first time , often as a result of the introduction of universal suffrage . However , a group of central European economists led by Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek identified the collectivist underpinnings to the various new socialist and fascist doctrines of government power as being different brands of political totalitarianism .
Frédéric François Chopin ( /ˈʃoʊpæn/ ; French pronunciation : ​ [ fʁe.de.ʁik fʁɑ̃.swa ʃɔ.pɛ̃ ] ; 22 February or 1 March 1810 – 17 October 1849 ) , born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin , [ n 1 ] was a Polish and French ( by citizenship and birth of father ) composer and a virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era , who wrote primarily for the solo piano . He gained and has maintained renown worldwide as one of the leading musicians of his era , whose " poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation . " Chopin was born in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw , and grew up in Warsaw , which after 1815 became part of Congress Poland . A child prodigy , he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20 , less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising .
Until the Church Building Act of 1818 , the period saw relatively few churches built in Britain , which was already well-supplied , although in the later years of the period the demand for Non-conformist and Roman Catholic places of worship greatly increased . Anglican churches that were built were designed internally to allow maximum audibility , and visibility , for preaching , so the main nave was generally wider and shorter than in medieval plans , and often there were no side-aisles . Galleries were common in new churches . Especially in country parishes , the external appearance generally retained the familiar signifiers of a Gothic church , with a tower or spire , a large west front with one or more doors , and very large windows along the nave , but all with any ornament drawn from the classical vocabulary . Where funds permitted , a classical temple portico with columns and a pediment might be used at the west front . Decoration inside was very limited , but churches filled up with monuments to the prosperous .
Saint Athanasius of Alexandria ( /ˌæθəˈneɪʃəs/ ; Greek : Ἀθανάσιος Ἀλεξανδρείας , Athanásios Alexandrías ; c. 296–298 – 2 May 373 ) , also called Athanasius the Great , Athanasius the Confessor or , primarily in the Coptic Orthodox Church , Athanasius the Apostolic , was the twentieth bishop of Alexandria ( as Athanasius I ) . His episcopate lasted 45 years ( c. 8 June 328 – 2 May 373 ) , of which over 17 were spent in five exiles ordered by four different Roman emperors . Athanasius is a renowned Christian theologian , a Church Father , the chief defender of Trinitarianism against Arianism , and a noted Egyptian leader of the fourth century .
Political unification returned in the mid-16th century , due to the efforts of Taungoo , a former vassal state of Ava . Taungoo 's young , ambitious king Tabinshwehti defeated the more powerful Hanthawaddy in the Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War ( 1534–41 ) . His successor Bayinnaung went on to conquer a vast swath of mainland Southeast Asia including the Shan states , Lan Na , Manipur , Mong Mao , the Ayutthaya Kingdom , Lan Xang and southern Arakan . However , the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia unravelled soon after Bayinnaung 's death in 1581 , completely collapsing by 1599 . Ayutthaya seized Tenasserim and Lan Na , and Portuguese mercenaries established Portuguese rule at Thanlyin ( Syriam ) .
Carnival in Haiti started in 1804 in the capital Port-au-Prince after the declaration of independence . The Port-au-Prince Carnival is one of the largest in North America . It is known as Kanaval in the Creole language . It starts in January , known as " Pre-Kanaval " , while the main carnival activities begin in February . In July 2012 , Haiti had another carnival called Kanaval de Fleur . Beautiful costumes , floats , Rara parades , masks , foods , and popular rasin music ( like Boukman Eksperyans , Foula Vodoule , Tokay , Boukan Ginen , Eritaj , etc . ) and kompa bands ( such as T-Vice , Djakout No . 1 , Sweet Micky , Kreyòl La , D.P . Express , Mizik Mizik , Ram , T-Micky , Carimi , Djakout Mizik , and Scorpio Fever ) play for dancers in the streets of the plaza of Champ-de-Mars . An annual song competition takes place .
Air defence in naval tactics , especially within a carrier group , is often built around a system of concentric layers with the aircraft carrier at the centre . The outer layer will usually be provided by the carrier 's aircraft , specifically its AEW & C aircraft combined with the CAP . If an attacker is able to penetrate this layer , then the next layers would come from the surface-to-air missiles carried by the carrier 's escorts ; the area-defence missiles , such as the RIM-67 Standard , with a range of up to 100 nmi , and the point-defence missiles , like the RIM-162 ESSM , with a range of up to 30 nmi . Finally , virtually every modern warship will be fitted with small-calibre guns , including a CIWS , which is usually a radar-controlled Gatling gun of between 20mm and 30mm calibre capable of firing several thousand rounds per minute .
The Ottomans abolished the feudal system previously in place and applied the millet system to Cyprus , under which non-Muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities . In a reversal from the days of Latin rule , the head of the Church of Cyprus was invested as leader of the Greek Cypriot population and acted as mediator between Christian Greek Cypriots and the Ottoman authorities . This status ensured that the Church of Cyprus was in a position to end the constant encroachments of the Roman Catholic Church . Ottoman rule of Cyprus was at times indifferent , at times oppressive , depending on the temperaments of the sultans and local officials , and the island began over 250 years of economic decline .
" The mind-stuff of the world is , of course , something more general than our individual conscious minds ... . The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time ; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it ... . It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed , has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness ... . Consciousness is not sharply defined , but fades into subconsciousness ; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature ... . It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character . But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience , and all else is remote inference . "
In 1578 , Elizabeth I granted a patent to Humphrey Gilbert for discovery and overseas exploration . That year , Gilbert sailed for the West Indies with the intention of engaging in piracy and establishing a colony in North America , but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic . In 1583 he embarked on a second attempt , on this occasion to the island of Newfoundland whose harbour he formally claimed for England , although no settlers were left behind . Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England , and was succeeded by his half-brother , Walter Raleigh , who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584 . Later that year , Raleigh founded the colony of Roanoke on the coast of present-day North Carolina , but lack of supplies caused the colony to fail .
The assumption that black-body radiation is thermal leads to an accurate prediction : the total amount of emitted energy goes up with the temperature according to a definite rule , the Stefan–Boltzmann law ( 1879–84 ) . But it was also known that the colour of the light given off by a hot object changes with the temperature , so that " white hot " is hotter than " red hot " . Nevertheless , Wilhelm Wien discovered the mathematical relationship between the peaks of the curves at different temperatures , by using the principle of adiabatic invariance . At each different temperature , the curve is moved over by Wien 's displacement law ( 1893 ) . Wien also proposed an approximation for the spectrum of the object , which was correct at high frequencies ( short wavelength ) but not at low frequencies ( long wavelength ) . It still was not clear why the spectrum of a hot object had the form that it has ( see diagram ) .
In 1931 , RCA Victor launched the first commercially available vinyl long-playing record , marketed as program-transcription discs . These revolutionary discs were designed for playback at 33 1⁄3 rpm and pressed on a 30 cm diameter flexible plastic disc , with a duration of about ten minutes playing time per side . RCA Victor 's early introduction of a long-play disc was a commercial failure for several reasons including the lack of affordable , reliable consumer playback equipment and consumer wariness during the Great Depression . Because of financial hardships that plagued the recording industry during that period ( and RCA 's own parched revenues ) , Victor 's long-playing records were discontinued by early 1933 .
In the 1982 Falklands War , the Argentine armed forces deployed the newest west European weapons including the Oerlikon GDF-002 35 mm twin cannon and SAM Roland . The Rapier missile system was the primary GBAD system , used by both British artillery and RAF regiment , a few brand-new FIM-92 Stinger were used by British special forces . Both sides also used the Blowpipe missile . British naval missiles used included Sea Dart and the older Sea Slug longer range systems , Sea Cat and the new Sea Wolf short range systems . Machine guns in AA mountings was used both ashore and afloat .
The government broadened land ownership by returning land that had been sold to large landowners in the late Ming period by families unable to pay the land tax . To give people more incentives to participate in the market , they reduced the tax burden in comparison with the late Ming , and replaced the corvée system with a head tax used to hire laborers . The administration of the Grand Canal was made more efficient , and transport opened to private merchants . A system of monitoring grain prices eliminated severe shortages , and enabled the price of rice to rise slowly and smoothly through the 18th century . Wary of the power of wealthy merchants , Qing rulers limited their trading licenses and usually refused them permission to open new mines , except in poor areas . These restrictions on domestic resource exploration , as well as on foreign trade , are held by some scholars as a cause of the Great Divergence , by which the Western world overtook China economically .
There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900 , except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles . Before the inception of the World Cup , the Olympics ( especially during the 1920s ) had the same status as the World Cup . Originally , the event was for amateurs only ; however , since the 1984 Summer Olympics , professional players have been permitted , albeit with certain restrictions which prevent countries from fielding their strongest sides . The Olympic men 's tournament is played at Under-23 level . In the past the Olympics have allowed a restricted number of over-age players per team . A women 's tournament was added in 1996 ; in contrast to the men 's event , full international sides without age restrictions play the women 's Olympic tournament .
The capital city of Windhoek plays a very important role in Namibia 's tourism due to its central location and close proximity to Hosea Kutako International Airport . According to The Namibia Tourism Exit Survey , which was produced by the Millennium Challenge Corporation for the Namibian Directorate of Tourism , 56 % of all tourists visiting Namibia during the time period , 2012 - 2013 , visited Windhoek . Many of Namibia 's tourism related parastatals and governing bodies such as Namibia Wildlife Resorts , Air Namibia and the Namibia Tourism Board as well as Namibia 's tourism related trade associations such as the Hospitality Association of Namibia are also all headquartered in Windhoek . There are also a number of notable hotels in Windhoek such as Windhoek Country Club Resort and some international hotel chains also operate in Windhoek , such as Avani Hotels and Resorts and Hilton Hotels and Resorts .
In 1941 , Nasser was posted to Khartoum , Sudan , which was part of Egypt at the time . Nasser returned to Sudan in September 1942 after a brief stay in Egypt , then secured a position as an instructor in the Cairo Royal Military Academy in May 1943 . In 1942 , the British Ambassador Miles Lampson marched into King Farouk 's palace and ordered him to dismiss Prime Minister Hussein Sirri Pasha for having pro-Axis sympathies . Nasser saw the incident as a blatant violation of Egyptian sovereignty and wrote , " I am ashamed that our army has not reacted against this attack " , and wished for " calamity " to overtake the British . Nasser was accepted into the General Staff College later that year . He began to form a group of young military officers with strong nationalist sentiments who supported some form of revolution . Nasser stayed in touch with the group 's members primarily through Amer , who continued to seek out interested officers within the Egyptian Armed Force 's various branches and presented Nasser with a complete file on each of them .
Timely 's first publication , Marvel Comics # 1 ( cover dated Oct. 1939 ) , included the first appearance of Carl Burgos ' android superhero the Human Torch , and the first appearances of Bill Everett 's anti-hero Namor the Sub-Mariner , among other features . The issue was a great success , with it and a second printing the following month selling , combined , nearly 900,000 copies . While its contents came from an outside packager , Funnies , Inc. , Timely had its own staff in place by the following year . The company 's first true editor , writer-artist Joe Simon , teamed with artist and emerging industry notable Jack Kirby to create one of the first patriotically themed superheroes , Captain America , in Captain America Comics # 1 ( March 1941 ) . It , too , proved a hit , with sales of nearly one million . Goodman formed Timely Comics , Inc. , beginning with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 1941 .
The first post-Classical published classification of humans into distinct races seems to be François Bernier 's Nouvelle division de la terre par les différents espèces ou races qui l'habitent ( " New division of Earth by the different species or races which inhabit it " ) , published in 1684 . In the 18th century the differences among human groups became a focus of scientific investigation . But the scientific classification of phenotypic variation was frequently coupled with racist ideas about innate predispositions of different groups , always attributing the most desirable features to the White , European race and arranging the other races along a continuum of progressively undesirable attributes . The 1735 classification of Carl Linnaeus , inventor of zoological taxonomy , divided the human race Homo sapiens into continental varieties of europaeus , asiaticus , americanus , and afer , each associated with a different humour : sanguine , melancholic , choleric , and phlegmatic , respectively . Homo sapiens europaeus was described as active , acute , and adventurous , whereas Homo sapiens afer was said to be crafty , lazy , and careless .
After the expulsion of the German population ethnic Russians , Belarusians , and Ukrainians were settled in the northern part . In the Soviet part of the region , a policy of eliminating all remnants of German history was pursued . All German place names were replaced by new Russian names . The exclave was a military zone , which was closed to foreigners ; Soviet citizens could only enter with special permission . In 1967 the remnants of Königsberg Castle were demolished on the orders of Leonid Brezhnev to make way for a new " House of the Soviets " .
Beyoncé attended St. Mary 's Elementary School in Fredericksburg , Texas , where she enrolled in dance classes . Her singing talent was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and she finished it , able to hit the high-pitched notes . Beyoncé 's interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven , singing John Lennon 's " Imagine " to beat 15/16-year-olds . In fall of 1990 , Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School , a music magnet school in Houston , where she would perform with the school 's choir . She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts and later Alief Elsik High School . Beyoncé was also a member of the choir at St. John 's United Methodist Church as a soloist for two years .
In March 1984 , Pioneer introduced the first consumer player with a solid-state laser , the LD-700 . It was also the first LD player to load from the front and not the top . One year earlier Hitachi introduced an expensive industrial player with a laser diode , but the player , which had poor picture quality due to an inadequate dropout compensator , was made only in limited quantities . After Pioneer released the LD-700 , gas lasers were no longer used in consumer players , despite their advantages , although Philips continued to use gas lasers in their industrial units until 1985 .
Gaddafi organized demonstrations and distributed posters criticizing the monarchy . In October 1961 , he led a demonstration protesting Syria 's secession from the United Arab Republic . During this they broke windows of a local hotel accused of serving alcohol . Catching the authorities ' attention , they expelled his family from Sabha . Gaddafi moved to Misrata , there attending Misrata Secondary School . Maintaining his interest in Arab nationalist activism , he refused to join any of the banned political parties active in the city – including the Arab Nationalist Movement , the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party , and the Muslim Brotherhood – claiming he rejected factionalism . He read voraciously on the subjects of Nasser and the French Revolution of 1789 , as well as the works of Syrian political theorist Michel Aflaq and biographies of Abraham Lincoln , Sun Yat-sen , and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk .
The growing likelihood of war in Europe dominated the early reign of George VI . The King was constitutionally bound to support Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 's appeasement of Hitler . However , when the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the Munich Agreement in 1938 , they invited him to appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with them . This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional , as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family . While broadly popular among the general public , Chamberlain 's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the House of Commons , which led historian John Grigg to describe the King 's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as " the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century " .
Many of the city 's buildings are in the Georgian style , although there are a number of examples of modern landmark structures , such as County Hall tower , which was , at one time the tallest building in Ireland until being superseded by another Cork City building : The Elysian . Across the river from County Hall is Ireland 's longest building ; built in Victorian times , Our Lady 's Psychiatric Hospital has now been renovated and converted into a residential housing complex called Atkins Hall , after its architect William Atkins .
Green is the color for green parties , Islamist parties , Nordic agrarian parties and Irish republican parties . Orange is sometimes a color of nationalism , such as in the Netherlands , in Israel with the Orange Camp or with Ulster Loyalists in Northern Ireland ; it is also a color of reform such as in Ukraine . In the past , Purple was considered the color of royalty ( like white ) , but today it is sometimes used for feminist parties . White also is associated with nationalism . " Purple Party " is also used as an academic hypothetical of an undefined party , as a Centrist party in the United States ( because purple is created from mixing the main parties ' colors of red and blue ) and as a highly idealistic " peace and love " party—in a similar vein to a Green Party , perhaps . Black is generally associated with fascist parties , going back to Benito Mussolini 's blackshirts , but also with Anarchism . Similarly , brown is sometimes associated with Nazism , going back to the Nazi Party 's tan-uniformed storm troopers .
The provisional results of the 2014 Myanmar Census show that the total population is 51,419,420 . This figure includes an estimated 1,206,353 persons in parts of northern Rakhine State , Kachin State and Kayin State who were not counted . People who were out of the country at the time of the census are not included in these figures . There are over 600,000 registered migrant workers from Myanmar in Thailand , and millions more work illegally . Burmese migrant workers account for 80 % of Thailand 's migrant workers . Population density is 76 per square kilometre ( 200/sq mi ) , among the lowest in Southeast Asia .
Since the founding of Freemasonry , many Bishops of the Church of England have been Freemasons , such as Archbishop Geoffrey Fisher . In the past , few members of the Church of England would have seen any incongruity in concurrently adhering to Anglican Christianity and practicing Freemasonry . In recent decades , however , reservations about Freemasonry have increased within Anglicanism , perhaps due to the increasing prominence of the evangelical wing of the church . The former Archbishop of Canterbury , Dr Rowan Williams , appeared to harbour some reservations about Masonic ritual , whilst being anxious to avoid causing offence to Freemasons inside and outside the Church of England . In 2003 he felt it necessary to apologise to British Freemasons after he said that their beliefs were incompatible with Christianity and that he had barred the appointment of Freemasons to senior posts in his diocese when he was Bishop of Monmouth .
However a log-periodic dipole array consists of a number of dipole elements of different lengths in order to obtain a somewhat directional antenna having an extremely wide bandwidth : these are frequently used for television reception in fringe areas . The dipole antennas composing it are all considered " active elements " since they are all electrically connected together ( and to the transmission line ) . On the other hand , a superficially similar dipole array , the Yagi-Uda Antenna ( or simply " Yagi " ) , has only one dipole element with an electrical connection ; the other so-called parasitic elements interact with the electromagnetic field in order to realize a fairly directional antenna but one which is limited to a rather narrow bandwidth . The Yagi antenna has similar looking parasitic dipole elements but which act differently due to their somewhat different lengths . There may be a number of so-called " directors " in front of the active element in the direction of propagation , and usually a single ( but possibly more ) " reflector " on the opposite side of the active element .
Dell previously had its headquarters in the Arboretum complex in northern Austin , Texas . In 1989 Dell occupied 127,000 square feet ( 11,800 m2 ) in the Arboretum complex . In 1990 , Dell had 1,200 employees in its headquarters . In 1993 , Dell submitted a document to Round Rock officials , titled " Dell Computer Corporate Headquarters , Round Rock , Texas , May 1993 Schematic Design . " Despite the filing , during that year the company said that it was not going to move its headquarters . In 1994 , Dell announced that it was moving most of its employees out of the Arboretum , but that it was going to continue to occupy the top floor of the Arboretum and that the company 's official headquarters address would continue to be the Arboretum . The top floor continued to hold Dell 's board room , demonstration center , and visitor meeting room . Less than one month prior to August 29 , 1994 , Dell moved 1,100 customer support and telephone sales employees to Round Rock . Dell 's lease in the Arboretum had been scheduled to expire in 1994 .
During the late Bronze Age the island experienced two waves of Greek settlement . The first wave consisted of Mycenaean Greek traders who started visiting Cyprus around 1400 BC . A major wave of Greek settlement is believed to have taken place following the Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece from 1100 to 1050 BC , with the island 's predominantly Greek character dating from this period . Cyprus occupies an important role in Greek mythology being the birthplace of Aphrodite and Adonis , and home to King Cinyras , Teucer and Pygmalion . Beginning in the 8th century BC Phoenician colonies were founded on the south coast of Cyprus , near present-day Larnaca and Salamis .
In 1937 , the Empire of Japan started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931 , beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War ( often considered a theatre of World War II ) . Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal Nanking Massacre ( the " Rape of Nanking " ) . Even children , the elderly , and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army . The total death toll , including estimates made by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal , was between 300,000 and 350,000 . The city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre . The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event .
Dutch is one of the closest relatives of both German and English [ n 5 ] and is said to be roughly in between them . [ n 6 ] Dutch , like English , has not undergone the High German consonant shift , does not use Germanic umlaut as a grammatical marker , has largely abandoned the use of the subjunctive , and has levelled much of its morphology , including the case system . [ n 7 ] Features shared with German include the survival of three grammatical genders—albeit with few grammatical consequences [ n 8 ] —as well as the use of modal particles , final-obstruent devoicing , and a similar word order . [ n 9 ] Dutch vocabulary is mostly Germanic and incorporates more Romance loans than German but fewer than English . [ n 10 ]
The Warsaw Treaty 's organization was two-fold : the Political Consultative Committee handled political matters , and the Combined Command of Pact Armed Forces controlled the assigned multi-national forces , with headquarters in Warsaw , Poland . Furthermore , the Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization which commands and controls all the military forces of the member countries was also a First Deputy Minister of Defense of the USSR , and the Chief of Combined Staff of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization was also a First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR . Therefore , although ostensibly an international collective security alliance , the USSR dominated the Warsaw Treaty armed forces .
Somalia established its first ISP in 1999 , one of the last countries in Africa to get connected to the Internet . According to the telecommunications resource Balancing Act , growth in internet connectivity has since then grown considerably , with around 53 % of the entire nation covered as of 2009 . Both internet commerce and telephony have consequently become among the quickest growing local businesses .
Special guest referees may be used from time to time ; by virtue of their celebrity status , they are often scripted to dispense with the appearance of neutrality and use their influence to unfairly influence the outcome of the match for added dramatic impact . Face special referees will often fight back against hostile heel wrestlers , particularly if the special referee is either a wrestler themselves or a famous martial artist ( such as Tito Ortiz in the main event at TNA 's THard Justice in 2005 ) . They also have the power to eject from ringside any of the heel wrestler 's entourage/stable , who may otherwise interfere with the match .
Midway proved to be the last great naval battle for two years . The United States used the ensuing period to turn its vast industrial potential into increased numbers of ships , planes , and trained aircrew . At the same time , Japan , lacking an adequate industrial base or technological strategy , a good aircrew training program , or adequate naval resources and commerce defense , fell further and further behind . In strategic terms the Allies began a long movement across the Pacific , seizing one island base after another . Not every Japanese stronghold had to be captured ; some , like Truk , Rabaul , and Formosa , were neutralized by air attack and bypassed . The goal was to get close to Japan itself , then launch massive strategic air attacks , improve the submarine blockade , and finally ( only if necessary ) execute an invasion .
The state has a rich history in ballet with five Native American ballerinas attaining worldwide fame . These were Yvonne Chouteau , sisters Marjorie and Maria Tallchief , Rosella Hightower and Moscelyne Larkin , known collectively as the Five Moons . The New York Times rates the Tulsa Ballet as one of the top ballet companies in the United States . The Oklahoma City Ballet and University of Oklahoma 's dance program were formed by ballerina Yvonne Chouteau and husband Miguel Terekhov . The University program was founded in 1962 and was the first fully accredited program of its kind in the United States .
The first documented visit by a European was in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano , a Florentine explorer in the service of the French crown , who sailed his ship La Dauphine into New York Harbor . He claimed the area for France and named it " Nouvelle Angoulême " ( New Angoulême ) .
During the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States , huge stockpiles of uranium were amassed and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium . Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 , an estimated 600 short tons ( 540 metric tons ) of highly enriched weapons grade uranium ( enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads ) have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the Russian Federation and several other former Soviet states . Police in Asia , Europe , and South America on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium , most of which was from ex-Soviet sources . From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection , Control , and Accounting Program , operated by the federal government of the United States , spent approximately US $ 550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia . This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities . Scientific American reported in February 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair . According to an interview from the article , one facility had been storing samples of enriched ( weapons grade ) uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project ; another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box .
Other major newspapers include Miami Today , headquartered in Brickell , Miami New Times , headquartered in Midtown , Miami Sun Post , South Florida Business Journal , Miami Times , and Biscayne Boulevard Times . An additional Spanish-language newspapers , Diario Las Americas also serve Miami . The Miami Herald is Miami 's primary newspaper with over a million readers and is headquartered in Downtown in Herald Plaza . Several other student newspapers from the local universities , such as the oldest , the University of Miami 's The Miami Hurricane , Florida International University 's The Beacon , Miami-Dade College 's The Metropolis , Barry University 's The Buccaneer , amongst others . Many neighborhoods and neighboring areas also have their own local newspapers such as the Aventura News , Coral Gables Tribune , Biscayne Bay Tribune , and the Palmetto Bay News .
In addition , like most Slavic languages , the Shtokavian verb also has one of two aspects : perfective or imperfective . Most verbs come in pairs , with the perfective verb being created out of the imperfective by adding a prefix or making a stem change . The imperfective aspect typically indicates that the action is unfinished , in progress , or repetitive ; while the perfective aspect typically denotes that the action was completed , instantaneous , or of limited duration . Some Štokavian tenses ( namely , aorist and imperfect ) favor a particular aspect ( but they are rarer or absent in Čakavian and Kajkavian ) . Actually , aspects " compensate " for the relative lack of tenses , because aspect of the verb determines whether the act is completed or in progress in the referred time .
There were serious scientific objections to the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution , including Karl von Nägeli 's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection . Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics . His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson ( later awarded the title Lord Kelvin ) , who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years . Darwin accepted blending inheritance , but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits , natural selection could not accumulate useful traits . Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition . Mivart supported directed evolution , and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection . In response , Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition . The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century .
The adolescent growth spurt is a rapid increase in the individual 's height and weight during puberty resulting from the simultaneous release of growth hormones , thyroid hormones , and androgens . Males experience their growth spurt about two years later , on average , than females . During their peak height velocity ( the time of most rapid growth ) , adolescents grow at a growth rate nearly identical to that of a toddler—about 4 inches ( 10.3 cm ) a year for males and 3.5 inches ( 9 cm ) for females . In addition to changes in height , adolescents also experience a significant increase in weight ( Marshall , 1978 ) . The weight gained during adolescence constitutes nearly half of one 's adult body weight . Teenage and early adult males may continue to gain natural muscle growth even after puberty .
Current Governor of the Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan had predicted the crisis in 2005 when he became chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.In 2005 , at a celebration honouring Alan Greenspan , who was about to retire as chairman of the US Federal Reserve , Rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector . In that paper , " Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier ? " , Rajan " argued that disaster might loom . " Rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to " take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but , in return , offer generous compensation the rest of the time . These risks are known as tail risks . But perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialise , financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimised . "
The presence of companies like Shell in the Niger-Delta has led to extreme environmental issues in the Niger Delta . Many pipelines in the Niger-Delta owned by Shell are old and corroded . Shell has acknowledged its responsibility for keeping the pipelines new but has also denied responsibility for environmental causes . This has led to mass protests from the Niger-Delta inhabitants and Amnesty International against Shell and Friends of the Earth Netherlands . It has also led to action plans to boycott Shell by environmental groups , and human rights groups . In January 2013 , a Dutch court rejected four out of five allegations brought against the firm over oil pollution in the Niger Delta but found a subsidiary guilty of one case of pollution , ordering compensation to be paid to a Nigerian farmer .
Apart from being an ardent gamer Spielberg has had a long history of involvement in video games . He has been giving thanks to his games of his division DreamWorks Interactive most notable as Someone 's in the Kitchen with script written by Animaniacs ' Paul Rugg , Goosebumps : Escape from HorrorLand , The Neverhood ( all in 1996 ) , Skullmonkeys , Dilbert 's Desktop Games , Goosebumps : Attack of the Mutant ( all 1997 ) , Boombots ( 1999 ) , T'ai Fu : Wrath of the Tiger ( 1999 ) , and Clive Barker 's Undying ( 2001 ) . In 2005 the director signed with Electronic Arts to collaborate on three games including an action game and an award winning puzzle game for the Wii called Boom Blox ( and its 2009 sequel : Boom Blox Bash Party ) . Previously , he was involved in creating the scenario for the adventure game The Dig . In 1996 , Spielberg worked on and shot original footage for a movie-making simulation game called Steven Spielberg 's Director 's Chair . He is the creator of the Medal of Honor series by Electronic Arts . He is credited in the special thanks section of the 1998 video game Trespasser . In 2013 , Spielberg has announced he is collaborating with 343 Industries for a live-action TV show of Halo .
From the 1980s , mainstream sensibilities were reasserted and serialization became less common as the number of comics magazines decreased and many comics began to be published directly as albums . Smaller publishers such as L'Association that published longer works in non-traditional formats by auteur-istic creators also became common . Since the 1990s , mergers resulted in fewer large publishers , while smaller publishers proliferated . Sales overall continued to grow despite the trend towards a shrinking print market .
Classical immunology ties in with the fields of epidemiology and medicine . It studies the relationship between the body systems , pathogens , and immunity . The earliest written mention of immunity can be traced back to the plague of Athens in 430 BCE . Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time . Many other ancient societies have references to this phenomenon , but it was not until the 19th and 20th centuries before the concept developed into scientific theory .
Often , the migration route of a long-distance migrator bird does n't follow a straight line between breeding and wintering grounds . Rather , it could follow an hooked or arched line , with detours around geographical barriers . For most land-birds , such barriers could consist in seas , large water bodies or high mountain ranges , because of the lack of stopover or feeding sites , or the lack of thermal columns for broad-winged birds .
In 2005 , Beyoncé teamed up with House of Brands , a shoe company , to produce a range of footwear for House of Deréon . In January 2008 , Starwave Mobile launched Beyoncé Fashion Diva , a " high-style " mobile game with a social networking component , featuring the House of Deréon collection . In July 2009 , Beyoncé and her mother launched a new junior apparel label , Sasha Fierce for Deréon , for back-to-school selling . The collection included sportswear , outerwear , handbags , footwear , eyewear , lingerie and jewelry . It was available at department stores including Macy 's and Dillard 's , and specialty stores Jimmy Jazz and Against All Odds . On May 27 , 2010 , Beyoncé teamed up with clothing store C & A to launch Deréon by Beyoncé at their stores in Brazil . The collection included tailored blazers with padded shoulders , little black dresses , embroidered tops and shirts and bandage dresses .
Starting in 1940 ( 18 months before Pearl Harbor ) , the nation mobilized , giving high priority to air power . American involvement in World War II in 1940–41 was limited to providing war material and financial support to Britain , the Soviet Union , and the Republic of China . The U.S. entered officially on 8 December 1941 following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Hawaii . Japanese forces soon seized American , Dutch , and British possessions across the Pacific and Southeast Asia , except for Australia , which became a main American forward base along with Hawaii .
Tacitus wrote in his Germania : Germania 9.6 : Ceterum nec cohibere parietibus deos neque in ullam humani oris speciem adsimulare ex magnitudine caelestium arbitrator – " The Germans , however , do not consider it consistent with the grandeur of celestial beings to confine the gods within walls , or to liken them to the form of any human countenance . " Germania 40 : mox vehiculum et vestis et , si credere velis , numen ipsum secreto lacu abluitur – " Afterwards the car , the vestments , and , if you like to believe it , the divinity herself , are purified in a secret lake . "
The Central Bank of Liberia is responsible for printing and maintaining the Liberian dollar , which is the primary form of currency in Liberia . Liberia is one of the world 's poorest countries , with a formal employment rate of 15 % . GDP per capita peaked in 1980 at US $ 496 , when it was comparable to Egypt 's ( at the time ) . In 2011 , the country 's nominal GDP was US $ 1.154 billion , while nominal GDP per capita stood at US $ 297 , the third-lowest in the world . Historically , the Liberian economy has depended heavily on foreign aid , foreign direct investment and exports of natural resources such as iron ore , rubber and timber .
Yugoslavia had a liberal travel policy permitting foreigners to freely travel through the country and its citizens to travel worldwide , whereas it was limited by most Communist countries . A number [ quantify ] of Yugoslav citizens worked throughout Western Europe . Tito met many world leaders during his rule , such as Soviet rulers Joseph Stalin , Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev ; Egypt 's Gamal Abdel Nasser , Indian politicians Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi ; British Prime Ministers Winston Churchill , James Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher ; U.S. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower , John F. Kennedy , Richard Nixon , Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter ; other political leaders , dignitaries and heads of state that Tito met at least once in his lifetime included Che Guevara , Fidel Castro , Yasser Arafat , Willy Brandt , Helmut Schmidt , Georges Pompidou , Queen Elizabeth II , Hua Guofeng , Kim Il Sung , Sukarno , Sheikh Mujibur Rahman , Suharto , Idi Amin , Haile Selassie , Kenneth Kaunda , Gaddafi , Erich Honecker , Nicolae Ceaușescu , János Kádár and Urho Kekkonen . He also met numerous celebrities .
During the 1950s and 1960s , FBI officials became increasingly concerned about the influence of civil rights leaders , whom they believed had communist ties or were unduly influenced by them . In 1956 , for example , Hoover sent an open letter denouncing Dr. T.R.M . Howard , a civil rights leader , surgeon , and wealthy entrepreneur in Mississippi who had criticized FBI inaction in solving recent murders of George W. Lee , Emmett Till , and other blacks in the South . The FBI carried out controversial domestic surveillance in an operation it called the COINTELPRO , which was short for " COunter-INTELligence PROgram . " It was to investigate and disrupt the activities of dissident political organizations within the United States , including both militant and non-violent organizations . Among its targets was the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , a leading civil rights organization with clergy leadership .
The best-known medieval Chinese name for Tibet is Tubo ( Chinese : 吐蕃 also written as 土蕃 or 土番 ; pinyin : Tǔbō or Tǔfān ) . This name first appears in Chinese characters as 土番 in the 7th century ( Li Tai ) and as 吐蕃 in the 10th-century ( Old Book of Tang describing 608–609 emissaries from Tibetan King Namri Songtsen to Emperor Yang of Sui ) . In the Middle Chinese spoken during that period , as reconstructed by William H. Baxter , 土番 was pronounced thux-phjon and 吐蕃 was pronounced thux-pjon ( with the x representing tone ) .
The group 's second LP , Queen II , was released in 1974 , and features rock photographer Mick Rock 's iconic image of the band on the cover . This image would be used as the basis for the 1975 " Bohemian Rhapsody " music video production . The album reached number five on the British album chart and became the first Queen album to chart in the UK . The Freddie Mercury-written lead single " Seven Seas of Rhye " reached number ten in the UK , giving the band their first hit . The album is the first real testament to the band 's distinctive layered sound , and features long complex instrumental passages , fantasy-themed lyrics , and musical virtuosity . Aside from its only single , the album also included the song " The March of the Black Queen " , a six-minute epic which lacks a chorus . The Daily Vault described the number as " menacing " . Critical reaction was mixed ; the Winnipeg Free Press , while praising the band 's debut album , described Queen II as a " over-produced monstrosity " . Allmusic has described the album as a favourite among the band 's hardcore fans , and it is the first of three Queen albums to feature in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .
The county has a long tradition of supplying freestone and building stone . Quarries at Doulting supplied freestone used in the construction of Wells Cathedral . Bath stone is also widely used . Ralph Allen promoted its use in the early 18th century , as did Hans Price in the 19th century , but it was used long before then . It was mined underground at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines , and as a result of cutting the Box Tunnel , at locations in Wiltshire such as Box . Bath stone is still used on a reduced scale today , but more often as a cladding rather than a structural material . Further south , Hamstone is the colloquial name given to stone from Ham Hill , which is also widely used in the construction industry . Blue Lias has been used locally as a building stone and as a raw material for lime mortar and Portland cement . Until the 1960s , Puriton had Blue Lias stone quarries , as did several other Polden villages . Its quarries also supplied a cement factory at Dunball , adjacent to the King 's Sedgemoor Drain . Its derelict , early 20th century remains , was removed when the M5 motorway was constructed in the mid-1970s . Since the 1920s , the county has supplied aggregates . Foster Yeoman is Europe 's large supplier of limestone aggregates , with quarries at Merehead Quarry . It has a dedicated railway operation , Mendip Rail , which is used to transport aggregates by rail from a group of Mendip quarries .
London has numerous venues for rock and pop concerts , including the world 's busiest arena the o2 arena and other large arenas such as Earls Court , Wembley Arena , as well as many mid-sized venues , such as Brixton Academy , the Hammersmith Apollo and the Shepherd 's Bush Empire . Several music festivals , including the Wireless Festival , South West Four , Lovebox , and Hyde Park 's British Summer Time are all held in London . The city is home to the first and original Hard Rock Cafe and the Abbey Road Studios where The Beatles recorded many of their hits . In the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s , musicians and groups like Elton John , Pink Floyd , David Bowie , Queen , The Kinks , The Rolling Stones , The Who , Eric Clapton , Led Zeppelin , The Small Faces , Iron Maiden , Fleetwood Mac , Elvis Costello , Cat Stevens , The Police , The Cure , Madness , The Jam , Dusty Springfield , Phil Collins , Rod Stewart and Sade , derived their sound from the streets and rhythms vibrating through London .
In December 1993 , the Famicom received a similar redesign . It also loads cartridges through a covered slot on the top of the unit and uses non-hardwired controllers . Because HVC-101 used composite video output instead of being RF only like the HVC-001 , Nintendo marketed the newer model as the AV Famicom ( AV仕様ファミコン , Eibui Shiyō Famikon ? ) . Since the new controllers do n't have microphones on them like the second controller on the original console , certain games such as the Disk System version of The Legend of Zelda and Raid on Bungeling Bay will have certain tricks that can not be replicated when played on an HVC-101 Famicom without a modded controller . However , the HVC-101 Famicom is compatible with most NES controllers due to having the same controller port . Nintendo had also released a 3D graphic capable headset . However , this peripheral was never released outside Japan . [ citation needed ]
Classical statistical mechanics requires the existence of h ( but does not define its value ) . Eventually , following upon Planck 's discovery , it was recognized that physical action can not take on an arbitrary value . Instead , it must be some multiple of a very small quantity , the " quantum of action " , now called the Planck constant . Classical physics can not explain this fact . In many cases , such as for monochromatic light or for atoms , this quantum of action also implies that only certain energy levels are allowed , and values in between are forbidden .
The Warnerke Standard Sensitometer consisted of a frame holding an opaque screen with an array of typically 25 numbered , gradually pigmented squares brought into contact with the photographic plate during a timed test exposure under a phosphorescent tablet excited before by the light of a burning Magnesium ribbon . The speed of the emulsion was then expressed in 'degrees ' Warnerke ( sometimes seen as Warn . or °W . ) corresponding with the last number visible on the exposed plate after development and fixation . Each number represented an increase of 1/3 in speed , typical plate speeds were between 10° and 25° Warnerke at the time .
The tourism industry began in the early 19th century when foreigners visited the Alps , traveled to the bases of the mountains to enjoy the scenery , and stayed at the spa-resorts . Large hotels were built during the Belle Époque ; cog-railways , built early in the 20th century , brought tourists to ever higher elevations , with the Jungfraubahn terminating at the Jungfraujoch , well above the eternal snow-line , after going through a tunnel in Eiger . During this period winter sports were slowly introduced : in 1882 the first figure skating championship was held in St. Moritz , and downhill skiing became a popular sport with English visitors early in the 20th century , as the first ski-lift was installed in 1908 above Grindelwald .
Hayek received new attention in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of conservative governments in the United States , United Kingdom , and Canada . After winning the United Kingdom general election , 1979 , Margaret Thatcher appointed Keith Joseph , the director of the Hayekian Centre for Policy Studies , as her secretary of state for industry in an effort to redirect parliament 's economic strategies . Likewise , David Stockman , Ronald Reagan 's most influential financial official in 1981 was an acknowledged follower of Hayek .
There are 29 isotopes of copper . 63Cu and 65Cu are stable , with 63Cu comprising approximately 69 % of naturally occurring copper ; they both have a spin of 3⁄2 . The other isotopes are radioactive , with the most stable being 67Cu with a half-life of 61.83 hours . Seven metastable isotopes have been characterized , with 68mCu the longest-lived with a half-life of 3.8 minutes . Isotopes with a mass number above 64 decay by β− , whereas those with a mass number below 64 decay by β+ . 64Cu , which has a half-life of 12.7 hours , decays both ways .
In 1939 the Regierungsbezirk Zichenau was annexed by Germany and incorporated into East Prussia . Parts of it were transferred to other regions , e.g . Suwałki to Regierungsbezirk Gumbinnen and Soldau to Regierungsbezirk Allenstein . Despite Nazi propaganda presenting all of the regions annexed as possessing significant German populations that wanted reunification with Germany , the Reich 's statistics of late 1939 show that only 31,000 out of 994,092 people in this territory were ethnic Germans .

During the English Civil War the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause . After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642 culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green , London was surrounded by defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication . The lines were built by an up to 20,000 people , and were completed in under two months . The fortifications failed their only test when the New Model Army entered London in 1647 , and they were levelled by Parliament the same year .
However , there is significant disagreement within Orthodox Judaism , particularly between Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism , about the extent and circumstances under which the proper application of Halakha should be re-examined as a result of changing realities . As a general rule , Haredi Jews believe that when at all possible the law should be maintained as it was understood by their authorities at the haskalah , believing that it had never changed . Modern Orthodox authorities are more willing to assume that under scrupulous examination , identical principles may lead to different applications in the context of modern life . To the Orthodox Jew , halakha is a guide , God 's Law , governing the structure of daily life from the moment he or she wakes up to the moment he goes to sleep . It includes codes of behaviour applicable to a broad range of circumstances ( and many hypothetical ones ) . There are though a number of halakhic meta-principles that guide the halakhic process and in an instance of opposition between a specific halakha and a meta-principle , the meta-principle often wins out . Examples of Halakhic Meta-Principles are : " Deracheha Darchei Noam " - the ways of Torah are pleasant , " Kavod Habriyot " - basic respect for human beings , " Pikuach Nefesh " - the sanctity of human life .
Wine was considered the basic drink , consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite inexpensive . Cato the Elder once advised cutting his rations in half to conserve wine for the workforce . Many types of drinks involving grapes and honey were consumed as well . Drinking on an empty stomach was regarded as boorish and a sure sign for alcoholism , the debilitating physical and psychological effects of which were known to the Romans . An accurate accusation of being an alcoholic was an effective way to discredit political rivals . Prominent Roman alcoholics included Mark Antony , and Cicero 's own son Marcus ( Cicero Minor ) . Even Cato the Younger was known to be a heavy drinker . [ citation needed ]
Portuguese cinema has a long tradition , reaching back to the birth of the medium in the late 19th century . Portuguese film directors such as Arthur Duarte , António Lopes Ribeiro , António Reis , Pedro Costa , Manoel de Oliveira , João César Monteiro , António-Pedro Vasconcelos , Fernando Lopes , João Botelho and Leonel Vieira , are among those that gained notability . Noted Portuguese film actors include Joaquim de Almeida , Daniela Ruah , Maria de Medeiros , Diogo Infante , Soraia Chaves , Ribeirinho , Lúcia Moniz , and Diogo Morgado .
During most of the war , the UN navies patrolled the west and east coasts of North Korea , sinking supply and ammunition ships and denying the North Koreans the ability to resupply from the sea . Aside from very occasional gunfire from North Korean shore batteries , the main threat to United States and UN navy ships was from magnetic mines . During the war , five U.S. Navy ships were lost to mines : two minesweepers , two minesweeper escorts , and one ocean tug . Mines and gunfire from North Korean coastal artillery damaged another 87 U.S. warships , resulting in slight to moderate damage .
In 1906 , precipitation hardening alloys were discovered by Alfred Wilm . Precipitation hardening alloys , such as certain alloys of aluminium , titanium , and copper , are heat-treatable alloys that soften when quenched ( cooled quickly ) , and then harden over time . After quenching a ternary alloy of aluminium , copper , and magnesium , Wilm discovered that the alloy increased in hardness when left to age at room temperature . Although an explanation for the phenomenon was not provided until 1919 , duralumin was one of the first " age hardening " alloys to be used , and was soon followed by many others . Because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight , these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry , including the construction of modern aircraft .
In terms of sexual identity , adolescence is when most gay/lesbian and transgender adolescents begin to recognize and make sense of their feelings . Many adolescents may choose to come out during this period of their life once an identity has been formed ; many others may go through a period of questioning or denial , which can include experimentation with both homosexual and heterosexual experiences . A study of 194 lesbian , gay , and bisexual youths under the age of 21 found that having an awareness of one 's sexual orientation occurred , on average , around age 10 , but the process of coming out to peers and adults occurred around age 16 and 17 , respectively . Coming to terms with and creating a positive LGBT identity can be difficult for some youth for a variety of reasons . Peer pressure is a large factor when youth who are questioning their sexuality or gender identity are surrounded by heteronormative peers and can cause great distress due to a feeling of being different from everyone else . While coming out can also foster better psychological adjustment , the risks associated are real . Indeed , coming out in the midst of a heteronormative peer environment often comes with the risk of ostracism , hurtful jokes , and even violence . Because of this , statistically the suicide rate amongst LGBT adolescents is up to four times higher than that of their heterosexual peers due to bullying and rejection from peers or family members .
Florey and Chain succeeded in purifying the first penicillin , penicillin G , in 1942 , but it did not become widely available outside the Allied military before 1945 . Later , Norman Heatley developed the back extraction technique for efficiently purifying penicillin in bulk . The chemical structure of penicillin was determined by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1945 . Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans . Furthermore , its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus , unlike the synthetic sulfonamides . The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented , and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety . For their successful development of penicillin , which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself , as a therapeutic drug , Ernst Chain and Howard Florey shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Fleming . Florey credited Dubos with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds , which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived Florey 's research in penicillin .
The eastern shoreline of Funafuti Lagoon was modified during World War II when the airfield ( what is now Funafuti International Airport ) was constructed . The coral base of the atoll was used as fill to create the runway . The resulting borrow pits impacted the fresh-water aquifer . In the low areas of Funafuti the sea water can be seen bubbling up through the porous coral rock to form pools with each high tide . Since 1994 a project has been in development to assess the environmental impact of transporting sand from the lagoon to fill all the borrow pits and low-lying areas on Fongafale . In 2014 the Tuvalu Borrow Pits Remediation ( BPR ) project was approved in order to fill 10 borrow pits , leaving Tafua Pond , which is a natural pond . The New Zealand Government funded the BPR project . The project was carried out in 2015 with 365,000 sqm of sand being dredged from the lagoon to fill the holes and improve living conditions on the island . This project increase the usable land space on Fongafale by eight per cent .
In the 20th century , as Beijing , Shanghai , Nanjing , and Wuhan had all been occupied by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War , the capital of the Republic of China had been temporary relocated to Chongqing , then a major city in Sichuan . An enduring legacy of this move is that nearby inland provinces , such as Shaanxi , Gansu , and Guizhou , which previously never had modern Western-style universities , began to be developed in this regard . The difficulty of accessing the region overland from the eastern part of China and the foggy climate hindering the accuracy of Japanese bombing of the Sichuan Basin , made the region the stronghold of Chiang Kai-Shek 's Kuomintang government during 1938-45 , and led to the Bombing of Chongqing .
The German states proclaimed their union as the German Empire under the Prussian king , Wilhelm I , uniting Germany as a nation-state . The Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871 gave Germany most of Alsace and some parts of Lorraine , which became the Imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine ( Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen ) .The German conquest of France and the unification of Germany upset the European balance of power , that had existed since the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and Otto von Bismarck maintained great authority in international affairs for two decades . French determination to regain Alsace-Lorraine and fear of another Franco-German war , along with British apprehension about the balance of power , became factors in the causes of World War I .
To make pulp from wood , a chemical pulping process separates lignin from cellulose fibres . This is accomplished by dissolving lignin in a cooking liquor , so that it may be washed from the cellulose ; this preserves the length of the cellulose fibres . Paper made from chemical pulps are also known as wood-free papers–not to be confused with tree-free paper ; this is because they do not contain lignin , which deteriorates over time . The pulp can also be bleached to produce white paper , but this consumes 5 % of the fibres ; chemical pulping processes are not used to make paper made from cotton , which is already 90 % cellulose .
During the 19th century , an important producer of art was the Academia de San Carlos ( San Carlos Art Academy ) , founded during colonial times , and which later became the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas ( the National School of Arts ) including painting , sculpture and graphic design , one of UNAM 's art schools . Many of the works produced by the students and faculty of that time are now displayed in the Museo Nacional de San Carlos ( National Museum of San Carlos ) . One of the students , José María Velasco , is considered one of the greatest Mexican landscape painters of the 19th century . Porfirio Díaz 's regime sponsored arts , especially those that followed the French school . Popular arts in the form of cartoons and illustrations flourished , e.g . those of José Guadalupe Posada and Manuel Manilla . The permanent collection of the San Carlos Museum also includes paintings by European masters such as Rembrandt , Velázquez , Murillo , and Rubens .
In September 2003 , a new type of blue LED was demonstrated by Cree that consumes 24 mW at 20 milliamperes ( mA ) . This produced a commercially packaged white light giving 65 lm/W at 20 mA , becoming the brightest white LED commercially available at the time , and more than four times as efficient as standard incandescents . In 2006 , they demonstrated a prototype with a record white LED luminous efficacy of 131 lm/W at 20 mA . Nichia Corporation has developed a white LED with luminous efficacy of 150 lm/W at a forward current of 20 mA . Cree 's XLamp XM-L LEDs , commercially available in 2011 , produce 100 lm/W at their full power of 10 W , and up to 160 lm/W at around 2 W input power . In 2012 , Cree announced a white LED giving 254 lm/W , and 303 lm/W in March 2014 . Practical general lighting needs high-power LEDs , of one watt or more . Typical operating currents for such devices begin at 350 mA .
On runways , green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing , while red lights indicate the end of the runway . Runway edge lighting consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway , indicating the edge . Some airports have more complicated lighting on the runways including lights that run down the centerline of the runway and lights that help indicate the approach ( an approach lighting system , or ALS ) . Low-traffic airports may use pilot controlled lighting to save electricity and staffing costs .
Hindu philosophy refers to a group of darśanas ( philosophies , world views , teachings ) that emerged in ancient India . The mainstream Hindu philosophy includes six systems ( ṣaḍdarśana ) – Samkhya , Yoga , Nyaya , Vaisheshika , Mimamsa and Vedanta . These are also called the Astika ( orthodox ) philosophical traditions and are those that accept the Vedas as authoritative , important source of knowledge . [ note 1 ] [ note 2 ] Ancient and medieval India was also the source of philosophies that share philosophical concepts but rejected the Vedas , and these have been called nāstika ( heterodox or non-orthodox ) Indian philosophies . Nāstika Indian philosophies include Buddhism , Jainism , Cārvāka , Ājīvika , and others .
According to Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli , Beyoncé uses different fashion styles to work with her music while performing . Her mother co-wrote a book , published in 2002 , titled Destiny 's Style an account of how fashion had an impact on the trio 's success . The B'Day Anthology Video Album showed many instances of fashion-oriented footage , depicting classic to contemporary wardrobe styles . In 2007 , Beyoncé was featured on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue , becoming the second African American woman after Tyra Banks , and People magazine recognized Beyoncé as the best-dressed celebrity .
Later , the public bars gradually improved until sometimes almost the only difference was in the prices , so that customers could choose between economy and exclusivity ( or youth and age , or a jukebox or dartboard ) . [ citation needed ] With the blurring of class divisions in the 1960s and 1970s , [ citation needed ] the distinction between the saloon and the public bar was often seen as archaic , [ citation needed ] and was frequently abolished , usually by the removal of the dividing wall or partition . [ citation needed ] While the names of saloon and public bar may still be seen on the doors of pubs , the prices ( and often the standard of furnishings and decoration ) are the same throughout the premises , and many pubs now comprise one large room . However the modern importance of dining in pubs encourages some establishments to maintain distinct rooms or areas .
Another example of the persecution of heretics under Protestant rule was the execution of the Boston martyrs in 1659 , 1660 , and 1661 . These executions resulted from the actions of the Anglican Puritans , who at that time wielded political as well as ecclesiastic control in the Massachusetts Bay Colony . At the time , the colony leaders were apparently hoping to achieve their vision of a " purer absolute theocracy " within their colony . [ citation needed ] As such , they perceived the teachings and practices of the rival Quaker sect as heretical , even to the point where laws were passed and executions were performed with the aim of ridding their colony of such perceived " heresies " . [ citation needed ] It should be noticed that the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox communions generally regard the Puritans themselves as having been heterodox or heretical .
iPods have won several awards ranging from engineering excellence , [ not in citation given ] to most innovative audio product , to fourth best computer product of 2006. iPods often receive favorable reviews ; scoring on looks , clean design , and ease of use . PC World says that iPod line has " altered the landscape for portable audio players " . Several industries are modifying their products to work better with both the iPod line and the AAC audio format . Examples include CD copy-protection schemes , and mobile phones , such as phones from Sony Ericsson and Nokia , which play AAC files rather than WMA .
Between 1993 and 1996 , the FBI increased its counter-terrorism role in the wake of the first 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City , New York ; the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma ; and the arrest of the Unabomber in 1996 . Technological innovation and the skills of FBI Laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted . Justice Department investigations into the FBI 's roles in the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents were found to be obstructed by agents within the Bureau . During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta , Georgia , the FBI was criticized for its investigation of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing . It has settled a dispute with Richard Jewell , who was a private security guard at the venue , along with some media organizations , in regard to the leaking of his name during the investigation .
There are two major sports centers in Nanjing , Wutaishan Sports Center and Nanjing Olympic Sports Center . Both of these two are comprehensive sports centers , including stadium , gymnasium , natatorium , tennis court , etc . Wutaishan Sports Center was established in 1952 and it was one of the oldest and most advanced stadiums in early time of People 's Republic of China .
It was decided to focus on bombing Britain 's industrial cities in daylight to begin with . The main focus of the bombing operations was against the city of London . The first major raid in this regard took place on 7 September . On 15 September , on a date known as the Battle of Britain Day , a large-scale raid was launched in daylight , but suffered significant loss for no lasting gain . Although there were a few large air battles fought in daylight later in the month and into October , the Luftwaffe switched its main effort to night attacks in order to reduce losses . This became official policy on 7 October . The air campaign soon got underway against London and other British cities . However , the Luftwaffe faced limitations . Its aircraft—Dornier Do 17 , Junkers Ju 88 , and Heinkel He 111s—were capable of carrying out strategic missions , but were incapable of doing greater damage because of bomb-load limitations . The Luftwaffe 's decision in the interwar period to concentrate on medium bombers can be attributed to several reasons : Hitler did not intend or foresee a war with Britain in 1939 ; the OKL believed a medium bomber could carry out strategic missions just as well as a heavy bomber force ; and Germany did not possess the resources or technical ability to produce four-engined bombers before the war .
From 1938 until 1995 , the U.S. Supreme Court did not invalidate any federal statute as exceeding Congress ' power under the Commerce Clause . Most actions by the federal government can find some legal support among the express powers , such as the Commerce Clause , whose applicability has been narrowed by the Supreme Court in recent years . In 1995 the Supreme Court rejected the Gun-Free School Zones Act in the Lopez decision , and also rejected the civil remedy portion of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 in the United States v. Morrison decision . Recently , the Commerce Clause was interpreted to include marijuana laws in the Gonzales v. Raich decision .
The League of American Bicyclists gave Tucson a gold rating for bicycle friendliness in late April 2007 . Tucson hosts the largest perimeter cycling event in the United States . The ride called " El Tour de Tucson " happens in November on the Saturday before Thanksgiving . El Tour de Tucson produced and promoted by Perimeter Bicycling has as many as 10,000 participants from all over the world , annually . Tucson is one of only nine cities in the U.S. to receive a gold rating or higher for cycling friendliness from the League of American Bicyclists . The city is known for its winter cycling opportunities . Both road and mountain biking are popular in and around Tucson with trail areas including Starr Pass and Fantasy Island .
At a certain temperature , ( usually between 1,500 °F ( 820 °C ) and 1,600 °F ( 870 °C ) , depending on carbon content ) , the base metal of steel undergoes a change in the arrangement of the atoms in its crystal matrix , called allotropy . This allows the small carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal , diffusing into the iron matrix . When this happens , the carbon atoms are said to be in solution , or mixed with the iron , forming a single , homogeneous , crystalline phase called austenite . If the steel is cooled slowly , the iron will gradually change into its low temperature allotrope . When this happens the carbon atoms will no longer be soluble with the iron , and will be forced to precipitate out of solution , nucleating into the spaces between the crystals . The steel then becomes heterogeneous , being formed of two phases ; the carbon ( carbide ) phase cementite , and ferrite . This type of heat treatment produces steel that is rather soft and bendable . However , if the steel is cooled quickly the carbon atoms will not have time to precipitate . When rapidly cooled , a diffusionless ( martensite ) transformation occurs , in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution . This causes the iron crystals to deform intrinsically when the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state , making it very hard and brittle .
After the Partisans managed to endure and avoid these intense Axis attacks between January and June 1943 , and the extent of Chetnik collaboration became evident , Allied leaders switched their support from Draža Mihailović to Tito . King Peter II , American President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill joined Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin in officially recognising Tito and the Partisans at the Tehran Conference . This resulted in Allied aid being parachuted behind Axis lines to assist the Partisans . On 17 June 1944 on the Dalmatian island of Vis , the Treaty of Vis ( Viški sporazum ) was signed in an attempt to merge Tito 's government ( the AVNOJ ) with the government in exile of King Peter II . The Balkan Air Force was formed in June 1944 to control operations that were mainly aimed at aiding his forces .
There are three main chemical pulping processes : the sulfite process dates back to the 1840s and it was the dominant method extent before the second world war . The kraft process , invented in the 1870s and first used in the 1890s , is now the most commonly practiced strategy , one of its advantages is the chemical reaction with lignin , that produces heat , which can be used to run a generator . Most pulping operations using the kraft process are net contributors to the electricity grid or use the electricity to run an adjacent paper mill . Another advantage is that this process recovers and reuses all inorganic chemical reagents . Soda pulping is another specialty process used to pulp straws , bagasse and hardwoods with high silicate content .
By developing commercial centres and routes , encouraging people to extend the area of cultivated land in the country and international trade through its dominions , the state performed basic economic functions in the Empire . But in all this the financial and political interests of the state were dominant . Within the social and political system they were living in Ottoman administrators could not have comprehended or seen the desirability of the dynamics and principles of the capitalist and mercantile economies developing in Western Europe .
Aristotle noted that cranes traveled from the steppes of Scythia to marshes at the headwaters of the Nile . Pliny the Elder , in his Historia Naturalis , repeats Aristotle 's observations .
Starting in the 1980s , he travelled with his all-female Amazonian Guard , who were allegedly sworn to a life of celibacy . However , according to psychologist Seham Sergewa , after the civil war several of the guards told her they had been pressured into joining and raped by Gaddafi and senior officials . He hired several Ukrainian nurses to care for him and his family 's health , and traveled everywhere with his trusted Ukrainian nurse Halyna Kolotnytska . Kolotnytska 's daughter denied the suggestion that the relationship was anything but professional .
In 1883 , salt water taffy was conceived in Atlantic City by David Bradley . The traditional story is that Bradley 's shop was flooded after a major storm , soaking his taffy with salty Atlantic Ocean water . He sold some " salt water taffy " to a girl , who proudly walked down to the beach to show her friends . Bradley 's mother was in the back of the store when the sale was made , and loved the name , and so salt water taffy was born .
Japanese seismologist Yuji Yagi at the University of Tsukuba said that the earthquake occurred in two stages : " The 155-mile Longmenshan Fault tore in two sections , the first one ripping about seven yards , followed by a second one that sheared four yards . " His data also showed that the earthquake lasted about two minutes and released 30 times the energy of the Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995 in Japan , which killed over 6,000 people . He pointed out that the shallowness of the epicenter and the density of population greatly increased the severity of the earthquake . Teruyuki Kato , a seismologist at the University of Tokyo , said that the seismic waves of the quake traveled a long distance without losing their power because of the firmness of the terrain in central China . According to reports from Chengdu , the capital of Sichuan province , the earthquake tremors lasted for " about two or three minutes " .
Though the music varied widely between regions and artists , the post-punk movement has been characterized by its " conceptual assault " on rock conventions and rejection of aesthetics perceived of as traditionalist , hegemonic or rockist in favor of experimentation with production techniques and non-rock musical styles such as dub , electronic music , disco , noise , jazz , krautrock , world music and the avant-garde . While post-punk musicians often avoided or intentionally obscured conventional influences , previous musical styles did serve as touchstones for the movement , including particular brands of glam , art rock and " [ the ] dark undercurrent of '60s music " . [ nb 1 ] According to Reynolds , artists once again approached the studio as an instrument , using new recording methods and pursuing novel sonic territories . Author Matthew Bannister wrote that post-punk artists rejected the high cultural references of 1960s rock artists like the Beatles and Bob Dylan as well as paradigms that defined " rock as progressive , as art , as 'sterile ' studio perfectionism ... by adopting an avant-garde aesthetic " .
The motor centers of reptiles react to sensory cues of vision , sound , touch , chemical , gravity , and motion with pre-set body movements and programmed postures . With the arrival of night-active mammals , smell replaced vision as the dominant sense , and a different way of responding arose from the olfactory sense , which is proposed to have developed into mammalian emotion and emotional memory . The mammalian brain invested heavily in olfaction to succeed at night as reptiles slept—one explanation for why olfactory lobes in mammalian brains are proportionally larger than in the reptiles . These odor pathways gradually formed the neural blueprint for what was later to become our limbic brain .
Arnold Schwarzenegger has been involved with the Special Olympics for many years after they were founded by his ex-mother-in-law , Eunice Kennedy Shriver . In 2007 , Schwarzenegger was the official spokesperson for the Special Olympics which were held in Shanghai , China . Schwarzenegger believes that quality school opportunities should be made available to children who might not normally be able to access them . In 1995 , he founded the Inner City Games Foundation ( ICG ) which provides cultural , educational and community enrichment programming to youth . ICG is active in 15 cities around the country and serves over 250,000 children in over 400 schools countrywide . He has also been involved with After-School All-Stars , and founded the Los Angeles branch in 2002 . ASAS is an after school program provider , educating youth about health , fitness and nutrition .
Bush focused his campaign on national security , presenting himself as a decisive leader and contrasted Kerry as a " flip-flopper . " This strategy was designed to convey to American voters the idea that Bush could be trusted to be tough on terrorism while Kerry would be " uncertain in the face of danger . " Bush ( just as his father did with Dukakis in the 1988 election ) also sought to portray Kerry as a " Massachusetts liberal " who was out of touch with mainstream Americans . One of Kerry 's slogans was " Stronger at home , respected in the world . " This advanced the suggestion that Kerry would pay more attention to domestic concerns ; it also encapsulated Kerry 's contention that Bush had alienated American allies by his foreign policy .
U.S. President Barack Obama has rarely used the term , but in his inaugural address on 20 January 2009 , he stated " Our nation is at war , against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred . " In March 2009 the Defense Department officially changed the name of operations from " Global War on Terror " to " Overseas Contingency Operation " ( OCO ) . In March 2009 , the Obama administration requested that Pentagon staff members avoid use of the term , instead using " Overseas Contingency Operation " . Basic objectives of the Bush administration " war on terror " , such as targeting al Qaeda and building international counterterrorism alliances , remain in place . In December 2012 , Jeh Johnson , the General Counsel of the Department of Defense , stated that the military fight will be replaced by a law enforcement operation when speaking at Oxford University , predicting that al Qaeda will be so weakened to be ineffective , and has been " effectively destroyed " , and thus the conflict will not be an armed conflict under international law . In May 2013 , Obama stated that the goal is " to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America " ; which coincided with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget having changed the wording from " Overseas Contingency Operations " to " Countering Violent Extremism " in 2010 .
The ultimate substantive legacy of Principia Mathematica is mixed . It is generally accepted that Kurt Gödel 's incompleteness theorem of 1931 definitively demonstrated that for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics , there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them , and hence that Principia Mathematica could never achieve its aims . However , Gödel could not have come to this conclusion without Whitehead and Russell 's book . In this way , Principia Mathematica 's legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals . But beyond this somewhat ironic legacy , the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic , epistemology , and metaphysics .
Public and private schools in Hyderabad are governed by the Central Board of Secondary Education and follow a " 10+2+3 " plan . About two-thirds of pupils attend privately run institutions . Languages of instruction include English , Hindi , Telugu and Urdu . Depending on the institution , students are required to sit the Secondary School Certificate or the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education . After completing secondary education , students enroll in schools or junior colleges with a higher secondary facility . Admission to professional graduation colleges in Hyderabad , many of which are affiliated with either Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad ( JNTUH ) or Osmania University ( OU ) , is through the Engineering Agricultural and Medical Common Entrance Test ( EAM-CET ) .
The Napoleonic Wars were the cause of the final dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire , and ultimately the cause for the quest for a German nation state in 19th-century German nationalism . After the Congress of Vienna , Austria and Prussia emerged as two competitors . Austria , trying to remain the dominant power in Central Europe , led the way in the terms of the Congress of Vienna . The Congress of Vienna was essentially conservative , assuring that little would change in Europe and preventing Germany from uniting . These terms came to a sudden halt following the Revolutions of 1848 and the Crimean War in 1856 , paving the way for German unification in the 1860s . By the 1820s , large numbers of Jewish German women had intermarried with Christian German men and had converted to Christianity . Jewish German Eduard Lasker was a prominent German nationalist figure who promoted the unification of Germany in the mid-19th century .
On January 13 , 1887 , the U , S . Government moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation . After a series of decisions and reversals , the Bell company won a decision in the Supreme Court , though a couple of the original claims from the lower court cases were left undecided . By the time that the trial wound its way through nine years of legal battles , the U.S. prosecuting attorney had died and the two Bell patents ( No . 174,465 dated March 7 , 1876 and No . 186,787 dated January 30 , 1877 ) were no longer in effect , although the presiding judges agreed to continue the proceedings due to the case 's importance as a " precedent " . With a change in administration and charges of conflict of interest ( on both sides ) arising from the original trial , the US Attorney General dropped the lawsuit on November 30 , 1897 leaving several issues undecided on the merits .
Asphalt/bitumen also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as " oil sands " in Alberta , Canada , and the similar " tar sands " in Utah , US . The Canadian province of Alberta has most of the world 's reserves of natural bitumen , in three huge deposits covering 142,000 square kilometres ( 55,000 sq mi ) , an area larger than England or New York state . These bituminous sands contain 166 billion barrels ( 26.4×10^9 m3 ) of commercially established oil reserves , giving Canada the third largest oil reserves in the world . and produce over 2.3 million barrels per day ( 370×10^3 m3/d ) of heavy crude oil and synthetic crude oil . Although historically it was used without refining to pave roads , nearly all of the bitumen is now used as raw material for oil refineries in Canada and the United States .
The Armed Forces are today funded by approximately $ 20.1 billion annually and are presently ranked 74th in size compared to the world 's other armed forces by number of total personnel , and 58th in terms of active personnel , standing at a strength of roughly 68,000 , plus 27,000 reservists , 5000 Rangers , and 19,000 supplementary reserves , bringing the total force to approximately 119,000 . The number of primary reserve personnel is expected to go up to 30,000 by 2020 , and the number of active to at least 70,000 . In addition , 5000 rangers and 19,000 supplementary personnel will be serving . If this happens the total strength would be around 124,000 . These individuals serve on numerous CF bases located in all regions of the country , and are governed by the Queen 's Regulations and Orders and the National Defence Act .
The latest study using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to humans and dogs together proved that dogs have same response to voices and use the same parts of the brain as humans to do so . This gives dogs the ability to recognize emotional human sounds , making them friendly social pets to humans .
Since the opening policy in 1979 , the Chinese department stores also develops swiftly along with the fast-growing economy . There are different department store groups dominating different regions . For example , INTIME department store has the biggest market presence in Zhejiang province , while Jinying department stores dominate Jiangsu Province . Besides , there are many other department store groups , such as Pacific , Parkson , Wangfujing，New World，etc. , many of them are expanding quickly by listing in the financial market .
In the subtractive color system , used in painting and color printing , green is created by a combination of yellow and blue , or yellow and cyan ; in the RGB color model , used on television and computer screens , it is one of the additive primary colors , along with red and blue , which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors . On the HSV color wheel , also known as the RGB color wheel , the complement of green is magenta ; that is , a color corresponding to an equal mixture of red and blue light ( one of the purples ) . On a traditional color wheel , based on subtractive color , the complementary color to green is considered to be red .
On the day of the abdication , the Oireachtas , the parliament of the Irish Free State , removed all direct mention of the monarch from the Irish constitution . The next day , it passed the External Relations Act , which gave the monarch limited authority ( strictly on the advice of the government ) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and to be involved in the making of foreign treaties . The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth .
In February 20 , 1988 , after a week of growing demonstrations in Stepanakert , capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast ( the Armenian majority area within Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic ) , the Regional Soviet voted to secede and join with the Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia . This local vote in a small , remote part of the Soviet Union made headlines around the world ; it was an unprecedented defiance of republic and national authorities . On February 22 , 1988 , in what became known as the " Askeran clash " , two Azerbaijanis were killed by Karabakh police . These deaths , announced on state radio , led to the Sumgait Pogrom . Between February 26 and March 1 , the city of Sumgait ( Azerbaijan ) saw violent anti-Armenian rioting during which 32 people were killed . The authorities totally lost control and occupied the city with paratroopers and tanks ; nearly all of the 14,000 Armenian residents of Sumgait fled .
Cockfighting is said to be the world 's oldest spectator sport and may have originated in Persia 6,000 years ago . Two mature males ( cocks or roosters ) are set to fight each other , and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed . Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour . The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians , Chinese , Greeks , and Romans , and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter . Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of cruelty to animals .
The cloth or fiber material used , resin material , and the cloth to resin ratio determine the laminate 's type designation ( FR-4 , CEM-1 , G-10 , etc . ) and therefore the characteristics of the laminate produced . Important characteristics are the level to which the laminate is fire retardant , the dielectric constant ( er ) , the loss factor ( tδ ) , the tensile strength , the shear strength , the glass transition temperature ( Tg ) , and the Z-axis expansion coefficient ( how much the thickness changes with temperature ) .
Both Roger Williams and John Clarke , his compatriot and coworker for religious freedom , are variously credited as founding the earliest Baptist church in North America . In 1639 , Williams established a Baptist church in Providence , Rhode Island , and Clarke began a Baptist church in Newport , Rhode Island . According to a Baptist historian who has researched the matter extensively , " There is much debate over the centuries as to whether the Providence or Newport church deserved the place of 'first ' Baptist congregation in America .

Schwarzenegger was born in Thal , a village bordering the city of Graz in Styria , Austria and christened Arnold Alois . His parents were Gustav Schwarzenegger ( August 17 , 1907 – December 13 , 1972 ) , and Aurelia Schwarzenegger ( née Jadrny ; July 29 , 1922 – August 2 , 1998 ) . Gustav was the local chief of police , and had served in World War II as a Hauptfeldwebel after voluntarily joining the Nazi Party in 1938 , though he was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria . He married Arnold 's mother on October 20 , 1945 ; – he was 38 , and she was 23 years old . According to Schwarzenegger , both of his parents were very strict : " Back then in Austria it was a very different world , if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents , the rod was not spared . " He grew up in a Roman Catholic family who attended Mass every Sunday .
The Mahayana sutras are a very broad genre of Buddhist scriptures that the Mahayana Buddhist tradition holds are original teachings of the Buddha . Some adherents of Mahayana accept both the early teachings ( including in this the Sarvastivada Abhidharma , which was criticized by Nagarjuna and is in fact opposed to early Buddhist thought ) and the Mahayana sutras as authentic teachings of Gautama Buddha , and claim they were designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual understanding .
The area near the border with Cameroon close to the coast is rich rainforest and part of the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests ecoregion , an important centre for biodiversity . It is habitat for the drill monkey , which is found in the wild only in this area and across the border in Cameroon . The areas surrounding Calabar , Cross River State , also in this forest , are believed to contain the world 's largest diversity of butterflies . The area of southern Nigeria between the Niger and the Cross Rivers has lost most of its forest because of development and harvesting by increased population , with it being replaced by grassland ( see Cross-Niger transition forests ) .
Sanskrit ( /ˈsænskrɪt/ ; Sanskrit : saṃskṛtam [ səmskr̩t̪əm ] or saṃskṛta , originally saṃskṛtā vāk , " refined speech " ) is the primary sacred language of Hinduism , a philosophical language in Buddhism , Hinduism , Sikhism and Jainism , and a literary language that was in use as a lingua franca in Greater India . It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan , originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European . Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand . As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists , Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies .
Many pesticides can be grouped into chemical families . Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines , organophosphates , and carbamates . Organochlorine hydrocarbons ( e.g. , DDT ) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes , cyclodiene compounds , and other related compounds . They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber , forcing the nerve to transmit continuously . Their toxicities vary greatly , but they have been phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate . :239–240 Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines . Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase , allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis . Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates , and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates . :136–137 Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates . Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides ( e.g . 2,4-D ) , triazines ( e.g. , atrazine ) , ureas ( e.g. , diuron ) , and Chloroacetanilides ( e.g. , alachlor ) . Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses . The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones , and grow cells without normal cell division , crushing the plant 's nutrient transport system . :300 Triazines interfere with photosynthesis . :335 Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families , including glyphosate .
On April 9 , 2007 , it was announced that Apple had sold its one-hundred millionth iPod , making it the biggest selling digital music player of all time . In April 2007 , Apple reported second quarter revenue of US $ 5.2 billion , of which 32 % was made from iPod sales . Apple and several industry analysts suggest that iPod users are likely to purchase other Apple products such as Mac computers .
Switzerland 's most important economic sector is manufacturing . Manufacturing consists largely of the production of specialist chemicals , health and pharmaceutical goods , scientific and precision measuring instruments and musical instruments . The largest exported goods are chemicals ( 34 % of exported goods ) , machines/electronics ( 20.9 % ) , and precision instruments/watches ( 16.9 % ) . Exported services amount to a third of exports . The service sector – especially banking and insurance , tourism , and international organisations – is another important industry for Switzerland .
After the American Revolutionary War , the number and proportion of free people of color increased markedly in the North and the South as slaves were freed . Most northern states abolished slavery , sometimes , like New York , in programs of gradual emancipation that took more than two decades to be completed . The last slaves in New York were not freed until 1827 . In connection with the Second Great Awakening , Quaker and Methodist preachers in the South urged slaveholders to free their slaves . Revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves , some by deed and others by will , so that from 1782 to 1810 , the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the South .
Northern leaders agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting . Secession and Confederate nationalism had to be totally repudiated and all forms of slavery or quasi-slavery had to be eliminated . Lincoln proved effective in mobilizing support for the war goals , raising large armies and supplying them , avoiding foreign interference , and making the end of slavery a war goal . The Confederacy had a larger area than it could defend , and it failed to keep its ports open and its rivers clear . The North kept up the pressure as the South could barely feed and clothe its soldiers . Its soldiers , especially those in the East under the command of General Robert E. Lee proved highly resourceful until they finally were overwhelmed by Generals Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman in 1864–65 , The Reconstruction Era ( 1863–77 ) began with the Emancipation proclamation in 1863 , and included freedom , full citizenship and the vote for the Southern blacks . It was followed by a reaction that left the blacks in a second class status legally , politically , socially and economically until the 1960s .
As of the first decade of the 21st century , contemporary neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of New Classical Architecture . Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism/Revivalism , Traditionalism or simply neoclassical architecture like the historical style . For sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture , materials and craftsmanship , the term Traditional Architecture ( or vernacular ) is mostly used . The Driehaus Architecture Prize is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture , and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist Pritzker Prize .
Greek culture has evolved over thousands of years , with its beginning in the Mycenaean civilization , continuing through the Classical period , the Roman and Eastern Roman periods and was profoundly affected by Christianity , which it in turn influenced and shaped . Ottoman Greeks had to endure through several centuries of adversity that culminated in genocide in the 20th century but nevertheless included cultural exchanges and enriched both cultures . The Diafotismos is credited with revitalizing Greek culture and giving birth to the synthesis of ancient and medieval elements that characterize it today .
The net quality of a ground reflection depends on the topography of the surface . When the irregularities of the surface are much smaller than the wavelength , we are in the regime of specular reflection , and the receiver sees both the real antenna and an image of the antenna under the ground due to reflection . But if the ground has irregularities not small compared to the wavelength , reflections will not be coherent but shifted by random phases . With shorter wavelengths ( higher frequencies ) , this is generally the case .
The most common source of new genes in eukaryotic lineages is gene duplication , which creates copy number variation of an existing gene in the genome . The resulting genes ( paralogs ) may then diverge in sequence and in function . Sets of genes formed in this way comprise a gene family . Gene duplications and losses within a family are common and represent a major source of evolutionary biodiversity . Sometimes , gene duplication may result in a nonfunctional copy of a gene , or a functional copy may be subject to mutations that result in loss of function ; such nonfunctional genes are called pseudogenes . :7.6
During this time , Atlantic City was under the mayoral reign of Edward L. Bader , known for his contributions to the construction , athletics and aviation of Atlantic City . Despite the opposition of many others , he purchased land that became the city 's municipal airport and high school football stadium , both of which were later named Bader Field in his honor . He led the initiative , in 1923 , to construct the Atlantic City High School at Albany and Atlantic Avenues . Bader , in November 1923 , initiated a public referendum , during the general election , at which time residents approved the construction of a Convention Center . The city passed an ordinance approving a bond issue for $ 1.5 million to be used for the purchase of land for Convention Hall , now known as the Boardwalk Hall , finalized September 30 , 1924 . Bader was also a driving force behind the creation of the Miss America competition .
In early 1962 Nasser again attempted to wrest control of the military command from Amer . Amer responded by directly confronting Nasser for the first time and secretly rallying his loyalist officers . Nasser ultimately backed down , wary of a possible violent confrontation between the military and his civilian government . According to Boghdadi , the stress caused by the UAR 's collapse and Amer 's increasing autonomy forced Nasser , who already had diabetes , to practically live on painkillers from then on .
In 2004 , worldwide sales of audio CDs , CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs . By 2007 , 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide . CDs are increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution , with the result that audio CD sales rates in the U.S. have dropped about 50 % from their peak ; however , they remain one of the primary distribution methods for the music industry . In 2014 , revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time .
In 2015 Beyoncé signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for ; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma , urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively , which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation .
The island experienced large-scale immigration over the 20th century , especially after the Second World War . Bermuda has a diverse population including both those with relatively deep roots in Bermuda extending back for centuries , and newer communities whose ancestry results from recent immigration , especially from Britain , North America , the West Indies , and the Portuguese Atlantic islands ( especially the Azores ) , although these groups are steadily merging . About 46 % of the population identified themselves with Bermudian ancestry in 2010 , which was a decrease from the 51 % who did so in the 2000 census . Those identifying with British ancestry dropped by 1 % to 11 % ( although those born in Britain remain the largest non-native group at 3,942 persons ) . The number of people born in Canada declined by 13 % . Those who reported West Indian ancestry were 13 % . The number of people born in the West Indies actually increased by 538 . A significant segment of the population is of Portuguese ancestry ( 10 % ) , the result of immigration over the past 160 years , of whom 79 % have residency status .

The downwards journey is completed at a reduced speed of 600 meters per minute , with the doors opening at the 52nd second .
The influence of Nasser 's Arab nationalism over the RCC was immediately apparent . The administration was instantly recognized by the neighbouring Arab nationalist regimes in Egypt , Syria , Iraq and Sudan , with Egypt sending experts to aid the inexperienced RCC . Gaddafi propounded Pan-Arab ideas , proclaiming the need for a single Arab state stretching across North Africa and the Middle East . In December 1969 , Libya founded the Arab Revolutionary Front with Egypt and Sudan as a step towards political unification , and in 1970 Syria stated its intention to join .
Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing , shortness of breath , chest tightness , and coughing . Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up . During recovery from an attack , it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils . Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air . Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms , usually in response to triggers , whereas others may have marked and persistent symptoms .
The San Diego Surf of the American Basketball Association is located in the city . The annual Farmers Insurance Open golf tournament ( formerly the Buick Invitational ) on the PGA Tour occurs at Torrey Pines Golf Course . This course was also the site of the 2008 U.S. Open Golf Championship . The San Diego Yacht Club hosted the America 's Cup yacht races three times during the period 1988 to 1995 . The amateur beach sport Over-the-line was invented in San Diego , and the annual world Over-the-line championships are held at Mission Bay every year .
The southern side of Miami includes Coral Way , The Roads and Coconut Grove . Coral Way is a historic residential neighborhood built in 1922 connecting Downtown with Coral Gables , and is home to many old homes and tree-lined streets . Coconut Grove was established in 1825 and is the location of Miami 's City Hall in Dinner Key , the Coconut Grove Playhouse , CocoWalk , many nightclubs , bars , restaurants and bohemian shops , and as such , is very popular with local college students . It is a historic neighborhood with narrow , winding roads , and a heavy tree canopy . Coconut Grove has many parks and gardens such as Villa Vizcaya , The Kampong , The Barnacle Historic State Park , and is the home of the Coconut Grove Convention Center and numerous historic homes and estates .
The first legal steps taken to end the occurrence of child labour was enacted more than fifty years ago . In 1966 , the nation adopted the UN General Assembly of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . This act legally limited the minimum age for when children could start work at the age of 14 . But 23 years later in 1989 the Convention on the Rights of Children was adopted and helped to reduce the exploitation of children and demanded safe working environments . They all worked towards the goal of ending the most problematic forms of child labour .
Von Neumann liked to eat and drink ; his wife , Klara , said that he could count everything except calories . He enjoyed Yiddish and " off-color " humor ( especially limericks ) . He was a non-smoker . At Princeton he received complaints for regularly playing extremely loud German march music on his gramophone , which distracted those in neighbouring offices , including Albert Einstein , from their work . Von Neumann did some of his best work blazingly fast in noisy , chaotic environments , and once admonished his wife for preparing a quiet study for him to work in . He never used it , preferring the couple 's living room with its television playing loudly .
Although testing can determine the correctness of software under the assumption of some specific hypotheses ( see hierarchy of testing difficulty below ) , testing can not identify all the defects within software . Instead , it furnishes a criticism or comparison that compares the state and behavior of the product against oracles—principles or mechanisms by which someone might recognize a problem . These oracles may include ( but are not limited to ) specifications , contracts , comparable products , past versions of the same product , inferences about intended or expected purpose , user or customer expectations , relevant standards , applicable laws , or other criteria .
According to John N. Gray , Popper held that " a theory is scientific only in so far as it is falsifiable , and should be given up as soon as it is falsified . " By applying Popper 's account of scientific method , Gray 's Straw Dogs states that this would have " killed the theories of Darwin and Einstein at birth . " When they were first advanced , Gray claims , each of them was " at odds with some available evidence ; only later did evidence become available that gave them crucial support . " Against this , Gray seeks to establish the irrationalist thesis that " the progress of science comes from acting against reason . "
There were four major HDTV systems tested by SMPTE in the late 1970s , and in 1979 an SMPTE study group released A Study of High Definition Television Systems :
Mexico’s capital is both the oldest capital city in the Americas and one of two founded by Amerindians ( Native Americans ) , the other being Quito . The city was originally built on an island of Lake Texcoco by the Aztecs in 1325 as Tenochtitlan , which was almost completely destroyed in the 1521 siege of Tenochtitlan , and subsequently redesigned and rebuilt in accordance with the Spanish urban standards . In 1524 , the municipality of Mexico City was established , known as México Tenochtitlán , and as of 1585 it was officially known as Ciudad de México ( Mexico City ) . Mexico City served as the political , administrative and financial center of a major part of the Spanish colonial empire . After independence from Spain was achieved , the Federal District was created in 1824 .
People of Ashkenazi descent constitute around 47.5 % of Israeli Jews ( and therefore 35–36 % of Israelis ) . They have played a prominent role in the economy , media , and politics of Israel since its founding . During the first decades of Israel as a state , strong cultural conflict occurred between Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews ( mainly east European Ashkenazim ) . The roots of this conflict , which still exists to a much smaller extent in present-day Israeli society , are chiefly attributed to the concept of the " melting pot " . That is to say , all Jewish immigrants who arrived in Israel were strongly encouraged to " melt down " their own particular exilic identities within the general social " pot " in order to become Israeli .
The Samoan word for dance is siva with unique gentle movements of the body in time to music and which tells a story , although the Samoan male dances can be more physical and snappy . The sasa is also a traditional dance where rows of dancers perform rapid synchronised movements in time to the rhythm of wooden drums ( pate ) or rolled mats . Another dance performed by males is called the fa'ataupati or the slap dance , creating rhythmic sounds by slapping different parts of the body . This is believed to have been derived from slapping insects on the body .
A number of sculptural ensembles of that era , erected at the tombs of royals and other dignitaries , have survived ( in various degrees of preservation ) in Nanjing 's northeastern and eastern suburbs , primarily in Qixia and Jiangning District . Possibly the best preserved of them is the ensemble of the Tomb of Xiao Xiu ( 475–518 ) , a brother of Emperor Wu of Liang . The period of division ended when the Sui Dynasty reunified China and almost destroyed the entire city , turning it into a small town .
Copper is synthesized in massive stars and is present in the Earth 's crust at a concentration of about 50 parts per million ( ppm ) , where it occurs as native copper or in minerals such as the copper sulfides chalcopyrite and chalcocite , the copper carbonates azurite and malachite , and the copper ( I ) oxide mineral cuprite . The largest mass of elemental copper discovered weighed 420 tonnes and was found in 1857 on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan , US . Native copper is a polycrystal , with the largest described single crystal measuring 4.4×3.2×3.2 cm .
The Heian period was preceded by the Nara period and began in 794 A.D after the movement of the capital of Japan to Heian-kyō ( present day Kyōto京都 ) , by the 50th emperor , Emperor Kanmu . Kanmu first tried to move the capital to Nagaoka-kyō , but a series of disasters befell the city , prompting the emperor to relocate the capital a second time , to Heian . The Heian Period is considered a high point in Japanese culture that later generations have always admired . The period is also noted for the rise of the samurai class , which would eventually take power and start the feudal period of Japan .
The Premier League is broadcast in the United States through NBC Sports . Premier League viewership has increased rapidly , with NBC and NBCSN averaging a record 479,000 viewers in the 2014–15 season , up 118 % from 2012–13 when coverage still aired on Fox Soccer and ESPN/ESPN2 ( 220,000 viewers ) , and NBC Sports has been widely praised for its coverage . NBC Sports reached a six-year extension with the Premier League in 2015 to broadcast the league through the 2021–22 season in a deal valued at $ 1 billion ( £640 million ) .
The Greeks of the Classical era made several notable contributions to science and helped lay the foundations of several western scientific traditions , like philosophy , historiography and mathematics . The scholarly tradition of the Greek academies was maintained during Roman times with several academic institutions in Constantinople , Antioch , Alexandria and other centres of Greek learning while Eastern Roman science was essentially a continuation of classical science . Greeks have a long tradition of valuing and investing in paideia ( education ) . Paideia was one of the highest societal values in the Greek and Hellenistic world while the first European institution described as a university was founded in 5th century Constantinople and operated in various incarnations until the city 's fall to the Ottomans in 1453 . The University of Constantinople was Christian Europe 's first secular institution of higher learning since no theological subjects were taught , and considering the original meaning of the world university as a corporation of students , the world’s first university as well .
During the Cold War , a principal focus of Canadian defence policy was contributing to the security of Europe in the face of the Soviet military threat . Toward that end , Canadian ground and air forces were based in Europe from the early 1950s until the early 1990s .
Stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley , and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast . There are a number of variations including Baltic porter , dry stout , and Imperial stout . The name Porter was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of London . This same beer later also became known as stout , though the word stout had been used as early as 1677 . The history and development of stout and porter are intertwined .
After World War II , eastern European countries such as the Soviet Union , Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Romania and Yugoslavia expelled the Germans from their territories . Many of those had inhabited these lands for centuries , developing a unique culture . Germans were also forced to leave the former eastern territories of Germany , which were annexed by Poland ( Silesia , Pomerania , parts of Brandenburg and southern part of East Prussia ) and the Soviet Union ( northern part of East Prussia ) . Between 12 and 16,5 million ethnic Germans and German citizens were expelled westwards to allied-occupied Germany .
About 69 % of the population is of Dutch ancestry . Approximately 10 % of the population consists of immigrants from Western countries , while 21 % of the population is of non-Western origin ( 9 % Moroccan , 5 % Turkish , 3 % Surinamese and Dutch Caribbean and 5 % of other countries ) . Some of the city 's boroughs have a relatively high percentage of originally non-Dutch inhabitants – i.e . Kanaleneiland 83 % and Overvecht 57 % . Like Rotterdam , Amsterdam , The Hague and other large Dutch cities , Utrecht faces some socio-economic problems . About 38 % percent of its population either earns a minimum income or is dependent on social welfare ( 17 % of all households ) . Boroughs such as Kanaleneiland , Overvecht and Hoograven consist primarily of high-rise housing developments , and are known for relatively high poverty and crime rate .
On August 24 , 2006 , Apple and Creative announced a broad settlement to end their legal disputes . Apple will pay Creative US $ 100 million for a paid-up license , to use Creative 's awarded patent in all Apple products . As part of the agreement , Apple will recoup part of its payment , if Creative is successful in licensing the patent . Creative then announced its intention to produce iPod accessories by joining the Made for iPod program .
The English sailor and adventurer William Adams ( 1564–1620 ) was the first Westerner to receive the dignity of samurai . The Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu presented him with two swords representing the authority of a samurai , and decreed that William Adams the sailor was dead and that Anjin Miura ( 三浦按針 ) , a samurai , was born . Adams also received the title of hatamoto ( bannerman ) , a high-prestige position as a direct retainer in the Shogun 's court . He was provided with generous revenues : " For the services that I have done and do daily , being employed in the Emperor 's service , the Emperor has given me a living " ( Letters ) . He was granted a fief in Hemi ( 逸見 ) within the boundaries of present-day Yokosuka City , " with eighty or ninety husbandmen , that be my slaves or servants " ( Letters ) . His estate was valued at 250 koku . He finally wrote " God hath provided for me after my great misery " , ( Letters ) by which he meant the disaster-ridden voyage that initially brought him to Japan .
In May 2014 , the Government of China banned the internal purchase of Windows 8-based products under government contracts requiring " energy-efficient " devices . The Xinhua News Agency claimed that Windows 8 was being banned in protest of Microsoft 's support lifecycle policy and the end of support for Windows XP ( which , as of January 2014 , had a market share of 49 % in China ) , as the government " obviously can not ignore the risks of running OS [ sic ] without guaranteed technical support . " However , Ni Guangnan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences had also previously warned that Windows 8 could allegedly expose users to surveillance by the United States government due to its heavy use of internet-based services .

Most Israelis are drafted into the military at the age of 18 . Men serve two years and eight months and women two years . Following mandatory service , Israeli men join the reserve forces and usually do up to several weeks of reserve duty every year until their forties . Most women are exempt from reserve duty . Arab citizens of Israel ( except the Druze ) and those engaged in full-time religious studies are exempt from military service , although the exemption of yeshiva students has been a source of contention in Israeli society for many years . An alternative for those who receive exemptions on various grounds is Sherut Leumi , or national service , which involves a program of service in hospitals , schools and other social welfare frameworks . As a result of its conscription program , the IDF maintains approximately 176,500 active troops and an additional 445,000 reservists .
Berlin starts National Cyber Defense Initiative : On June 16 , 2011 , the German Minister for Home Affairs , officially opened the new German NCAZ ( National Center for Cyber Defense ) Nationales Cyber-Abwehrzentrum located in Bonn . The NCAZ closely cooperates with BSI ( Federal Office for Information Security ) Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik , BKA ( Federal Police Organisation ) Bundeskriminalamt ( Deutschland ) , BND ( Federal Intelligence Service ) Bundesnachrichtendienst , MAD ( Military Intelligence Service ) Amt für den Militärischen Abschirmdienst and other national organisations in Germany taking care of national security aspects . According to the Minister the primary task of the new organisation founded on February 23 , 2011 , is to detect and prevent attacks against the national infrastructure and mentioned incidents like Stuxnet .
The Japanese enlarged administration and appointed local leaders , which weakened the authority of local traditional leaders . Japan also tried to change the social organization in the islands from Matrilineality to the Japanese Patriarchal system , but with no success . Moreover , during the 1930s , one third of all land up to the high water level was declared the property of the Japanese government . On the archipelago , before it banned foreign traders , the activities of Catholic and Protestant missionaries were allowed . Indigenous people were educated in Japanese schools , and studied Japanese language and Japanese culture . This policy was the government strategy not only in the Marshall Islands , but on all the other mandated territories in Micronesia . On March 27 , 1933 , Japan handed in its notice at the League of Nations , but continued to manage the islands , and in the late 1930s began building air bases on several atolls . The Marshall Islands were in an important geographical position , being the easternmost point in Japan 's defensive ring at the beginning of World War II .
In January 1989 , Madonna signed an endorsement deal with soft-drink manufacturer , Pepsi . In one of her Pepsi commercials , she debuted her song " Like a Prayer " . The corresponding music video featured many Catholic symbols such as stigmata and cross burning , and a dream of making love to a saint , leading the Vatican to condemn the video . Religious groups sought to ban the commercial and boycott Pepsi products . Pepsi revoked the commercial and canceled her sponsorship contract . The song was included on Madonna 's fourth studio album , Like a Prayer , which was co-written and co-produced by Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray . Madonna received positive feedback for the album , with Rolling Stone writing that it was " as close to art as pop music gets " . Like a Prayer peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 15 million copies worldwide , with 4 million copies sold in the U.S. alone . Six singles were released from the album , including " Like a Prayer " , which reached number one , and " Express Yourself " and " Cherish " , both peaking at number two . By the end of the 1980s , Madonna was named as the " Artist of the Decade " by MTV , Billboard and Musician magazine .
In 1956 , the British and French prime ministers , Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet , discussed the possibility of France joining the Commonwealth . The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the Treaty of Rome , which established the European Economic Community , the precursor to the European Union . In November 1956 , Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal . Lord Mountbatten claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion , though Eden denied it . Eden resigned two months later .
From April 20–23 , 1989 , pre-election meetings were held in Lviv for four consecutive days , drawing crowds of up to 25,000 . The action included an one-hour warning strike at eight local factories and institutions . It was the first labor strike in Lviv since 1944 . On May 3 , a pre-election rally attracted 30,000 in Lviv . On May 7 , The Memorial Society organized a mass meeting at Bykivnia , site of a mass grave of Ukrainian and Polish victims of Stalinist terror . After a march from Kiev to the site , a memorial service was staged .
Treaties can be loosely compared to contracts : both are means of willing parties assuming obligations among themselves , and a party to either that fails to live up to their obligations can be held liable under international law .
Modern Egypt is considered to be a regional and middle power , with significant cultural , political , and military influence in North Africa , the Middle East and the Muslim world . Its economy is one of the largest and most diversified in the Middle East , with sectors such as tourism , agriculture , industry and services at almost equal production levels . In 2011 , longtime President Hosni Mubarak stepped down amid mass protests . Later elections saw the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood , which was ousted by the army a year later amid mass protests .
Historians see the growing Roman influence over the east , as with the west , as not a matter of intentional empire-building , but constant crisis management narrowly focused on short-term goals within a highly unstable , unpredictable , and inter-dependent network of alliances and dependencies . With some major exceptions of outright military rule , the Roman Republic remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms ( with varying degrees of independence , both de jure and de facto ) until it transitioned into the Roman Empire . It was not until the time of the Roman Empire that the entire Roman world was organized into provinces under explicit Roman control .
Biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli described her ballad " I 'll Remember " ( 1994 ) as an attempt to tone down her provocative image . The song was recorded for Alek Keshishian 's film With Honors . She made a subdued appearance with Letterman at an awards show and appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno after realizing that she needed to change her musical direction in order to sustain her popularity . With her sixth studio album , Bedtime Stories ( 1994 ) , Madonna employed a softer image to try to improve the public perception . The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and produced four singles , including " Secret " and " Take a Bow " , the latter topping the Hot 100 for seven weeks , the longest period of any Madonna single . At the same time , she became romantically involved with fitness trainer Carlos Leon . Something to Remember , a collection of ballads , was released in November 1995 . The album featured three new songs : " You 'll See " , " One More Chance " , and a cover of Marvin Gaye 's " I Want You " .
In ancient Greece , the epics of Homer , who wrote the Iliad and the Odyssey , and Hesiod , who wrote Works and Days and Theogony , are some of the earliest , and most influential , of Ancient Greek literature . Classical Greek genres included philosophy , poetry , historiography , comedies and dramas . Plato and Aristotle authored philosophical texts that are the foundation of Western philosophy , Sappho and Pindar were influential lyric poets , and Herodotus and Thucydides were early Greek historians . Although drama was popular in Ancient Greece , of the hundreds of tragedies written and performed during the classical age , only a limited number of plays by three authors still exist : Aeschylus , Sophocles , and Euripides . The plays of Aristophanes provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy , the earliest form of Greek Comedy , and are in fact used to define the genre .
In an attempt to gain increased support from Polish nationalists and patriots , Napoleon termed the war the Second Polish War—the First Polish War had been the Bar Confederation uprising by Polish nobles against Russia in 1768 . Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland to be joined with the Duchy of Warsaw and an independent Poland created . This was rejected by Napoleon , who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen . Napoleon refused to manumit the Russian serfs because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army 's rear . The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France 's retreat .
Opinions differ whether the transition to liberal democracy is underway . According to some reports , the military 's presence continues as the label 'disciplined democracy ' suggests . This label asserts that the Burmese military is allowing certain civil liberties while clandestinely institutionalising itself further into Burmese politics . Such an assertion assumes that reforms only occurred when the military was able to safeguard its own interests through the transition—here , " transition " does not refer to a transition to a liberal democracy , but transition to a quasi-military rule .
Mali underwent economic reform , beginning in 1988 by signing agreements with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . During 1988 to 1996 , Mali 's government largely reformed public enterprises . Since the agreement , sixteen enterprises were privatized , 12 partially privatized , and 20 liquidated . In 2005 , the Malian government conceded a railroad company to the Savage Corporation . Two major companies , Societé de Telecommunications du Mali ( SOTELMA ) and the Cotton Ginning Company ( CMDT ) , were expected to be privatized in 2008 .
Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture , convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world , mostly depending on distance from the equator . Although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends , all renewable energies , other than geothermal and tidal , derive their energy from the Sun in a direct or indirect way .
British colonial rule introduced Western elements of culture to Burma . Burma 's education system is modelled after that of the United Kingdom . Colonial architectural influences are most evident in major cities such as Yangon . Many ethnic minorities , particularly the Karen in the southeast and the Kachin and Chin who populate the north and northeast , practice Christianity . According to the The World Factbook , the Burman population is 68 % and the ethnic groups constitute 32 % . However , the exiled leaders and organisations claims that ethnic population is 40 % , which is implicitly contrasted with CIA report ( official US report ) .
In intelligent mammals , such as primates , the cerebrum is larger relative to the rest of the brain . Intelligence itself is not easy to define , but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn , matched with behavioral flexibility . Rats , for example , are considered to be highly intelligent , as they can learn and perform new tasks , an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat . In some mammals , food gathering appears to be related to intelligence : a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat , which must think to outwit its prey .
During a 10-day run in Oklahoma City , the State Fair of Oklahoma attracts roughly one million people along with the annual Festival of the Arts . Large national pow-wows , various Latin and Asian heritage festivals , and cultural festivals such as the Juneteenth celebrations are held in Oklahoma City each year . The Tulsa State Fair attracts over one million people during its 10-day run , and the city 's Mayfest festival entertained more than 375,000 people in four days during 2007 . In 2006 , Tulsa 's Oktoberfest was named one of the top 10 in the world by USA Today and one of the top German food festivals in the nation by Bon Appetit magazine .
Major projects include the current construction of a new campus for Gateway Community College downtown , and also a 32-story , 500-unit apartment/retail building called 360 State Street . The 360 State Street project is now occupied and is the largest residential building in Connecticut . A new boathouse and dock is planned for New Haven Harbor , and the linear park Farmington Canal Trail is set to extend into downtown New Haven within the coming year . Additionally , foundation and ramp work to widen I-95 to create a new harbor crossing for New Haven , with an extradosed bridge to replace the 1950s-era Q Bridge , has begun . The city still hopes to redevelop the site of the New Haven Coliseum , which was demolished in 2007 .
The most commonly used forms of medium distance transport in Hyderabad include government owned services such as light railways and buses , as well as privately operated taxis and auto rickshaws . Bus services operate from the Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station in the city centre and carry over 130 million passengers daily across the entire network . :76 Hyderabad 's light rail transportation system , the Multi-Modal Transport System ( MMTS ) , is a three line suburban rail service used by over 160,000 passengers daily . Complementing these government services are minibus routes operated by Setwin ( Society for Employment Promotion & Training in Twin Cities ) . Intercity rail services also operate from Hyderabad ; the main , and largest , station is Secunderabad Railway Station , which serves as Indian Railways ' South Central Railway zone headquarters and a hub for both buses and MMTS light rail services connecting Secunderabad and Hyderabad . Other major railway stations in Hyderabad are Hyderabad Deccan Station , Kachiguda Railway Station , Begumpet Railway Station , Malkajgiri Railway Station and Lingampally Railway Station . The Hyderabad Metro , a new rapid transit system , is to be added to the existing public transport infrastructure and is scheduled to operate three lines by 2015 .
Some researchers believe that the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the 17th century . According to this hypothesis , in 1648 several koches of Semyon Dezhnyov 's expedition came ashore in Alaska by storm and founded this settlement . This hypothesis is based on the testimony of Chukchi geographer Nikolai Daurkin , who had visited Alaska in 1764–1765 and who had reported on a village on the Kheuveren River , populated by " bearded men " who " pray to the icons " . Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with Koyuk River .
Voting results have been a consistent source of controversy . The mechanism of voting had also aroused considerable criticisms , most notably in season two when Ruben Studdard beat Clay Aiken in a close vote , and in season eight , when the massive increase in text votes ( 100 million more text votes than season 7 ) fueled the texting controversy . Concerns about power voting have been expressed from the very first season . Since 2004 , votes also have been affected to a limited degree by online communities such as DialIdol , Vote for the Worst ( closed in 2013 ) , and Vote for the Girls ( started 2010 ) .
The earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo , may be two figures from the Ionic sanctuary on the island of Delos . Such statues were found across the Greek speaking world , the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoios , Boeotia alone . The last stage in the development of the Kouros type is the late archaic period ( 520–485 BC ) , in which the Greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole . Ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze Piraeus Apollo . It was found in Piraeus , the harbour of Athens . The statue originally held the bow in its left hand , and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand . It probably comes from north-eastern Peloponnesus . The emphasis is given in anatomy , and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion , and beauty relative to proportions , which appear mostly in post-Archaic art . The statue throws some light on an artistic centre which , with an independently developed harder , simpler , and heavier style , restricts Ionian influence in Athens . Finally , this is the germ from which the art of Polykleitos was to grow two or three generations later .
Albert the Great wrote that wisdom and understanding enhance one 's faith in God . According to him , these are the tools that God uses to commune with a contemplative . Love in the soul is both the cause and result of true understanding and judgement . It causes not only an intellectual knowledge of God , but a spiritual and emotional knowledge as well . Contemplation is the means whereby one can obtain this goal of understanding . Things that once seemed static and unchanging become full of possibility and perfection . The contemplative then knows that God is , but she does not know what God is . Thus , contemplation forever produces a mystified , imperfect knowledge of God . The soul is exalted beyond the rest of God 's creation but it can not see God Himself .
The Great Depression ended at different times in different countries with the effect lasting into the next era . America 's Great Depression ended in 1941 with America 's entry into World War II . The majority of countries set up relief programs , and most underwent some sort of political upheaval , pushing them to the left or right . In some world states , the desperate citizens turned toward nationalist demagogues—the most infamous being Adolf Hitler—setting the stage for the next era of war . The convulsion brought on by the worldwide depression resulted in the rise of Nazism . In Asia , Japan became an ever more assertive power , especially with regards to China .
Insects were among the earliest terrestrial herbivores and acted as major selection agents on plants . Plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects , in turn , evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins . Many insects make use of these toxins to protect themselves from their predators . Such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors . This successful evolutionary pattern has also been used by mimics . Over time , this has led to complex groups of coevolved species . Conversely , some interactions between plants and insects , like pollination , are beneficial to both organisms . Coevolution has led to the development of very specific mutualisms in such systems .
Clay models of ducks found in China dating back to 4000 BC may indicate the domestication of ducks took place there during the Yangshao culture . Even if this is not the case , domestication of the duck took place in the Far East at least 1500 years earlier than in the West . Lucius Columella , writing in the first century BC , advised those who sought to rear ducks to collect wildfowl eggs and put them under a broody hen , because when raised in this way , the ducks " lay aside their wild nature and without hesitation breed when shut up in the bird pen " . Despite this , ducks did not appear in agricultural texts in Western Europe until about 810 AD , when they began to be mentioned alongside geese , chickens , and peafowl as being used for rental payments made by tenants to landowners .
Though almost any variety of acoustic mandolin might be adequate for Irish traditional music , virtually all Irish players prefer flat-backed instruments with oval sound holes to the Italian-style bowl-back mandolins or the carved-top mandolins with f-holes favoured by bluegrass mandolinists . The former are often too soft-toned to hold their own in a session ( as well as having a tendency to not stay in place on the player 's lap ) , whilst the latter tend to sound harsh and overbearing to the traditional ear . The f-hole mandolin , however , does come into its own in a traditional session , where its brighter tone cuts through the sonic clutter of a pub . Greatly preferred for formal performance and recording are flat-topped " Irish-style " mandolins ( reminiscent of the WWI-era Martin Army-Navy mandolin ) and carved ( arch ) top mandolins with oval soundholes , such as the Gibson A-style of the 1920s .
About 150,000 East African and black people live in Israel , amounting to just over 2 % of the nation 's population . The vast majority of these , some 120,000 , are Beta Israel , most of whom are recent immigrants who came during the 1980s and 1990s from Ethiopia . In addition , Israel is home to over 5,000 members of the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem movement that are descendants of African Americans who emigrated to Israel in the 20th century , and who reside mainly in a distinct neighborhood in the Negev town of Dimona . Unknown numbers of black converts to Judaism reside in Israel , most of them converts from the United Kingdom , Canada , and the United States .
After his arrival in 1674 , Captain Damian de Esplana ordered the arrest of rebels who attacked the population of certain towns . Hostilities eventually led to the destruction of villages such as Chochogo , Pepura , Tumon , Sidia-Aty , Sagua , Nagan and Ninca . :74–75 Starting in June 1676 , the first Spanish Governor of Guam , Capt . Francisco de Irrisarri y Vinar controlled internal affairs more strictly than his predecessors in order to curb tensions . He also ordered the construction of schools , roads and other infrastructure . :75–76 Later , Capt . Jose de Quiroga arrived in 1680 and continued some of the development projects started by his predecessors . He also continued the search for the rebels who had assassinated Father San Vitores , resulting in campaigns against the rebels which were hiding out in some islands , eventually leading to the death of Matapang , Hurao and Aguarin . :77–78 Quiroga brought some natives from the northern islands to Guam , ordering the population to live in a few large villages . :78–79 These included Jinapsan , Umatac , Pago , Agat and Inarajan , where he built a number of churches . :79 By July 1695 , Quiroga had completed the pacification process in Guam , Rota , Tinian and Aguigan . :85
Currently printed denominations are $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 50 , and $ 100 . Notes above the $ 100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969 . These notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by organized crime ; it was the latter usage that prompted President Richard Nixon to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use . With the advent of electronic banking , they became less necessary . Notes in denominations of $ 500 , $ 1,000 , $ 5,000 , $ 10,000 and $ 100,000 were all produced at one time ; see large denomination bills in U.S. currency for details . These notes are now collectors ' items and are worth more than their face value to collectors .
The constraints of constructing a flight deck affect the role of a given carrier strongly , as they influence the weight , type , and configuration of the aircraft that may be launched . For example , assisted launch mechanisms are used primarily for heavy aircraft , especially those loaded with air-to-ground weapons . CATOBAR is most commonly used on USN supercarriers as it allows the deployment of heavy jets with full loadouts , especially on ground-attack missions . STOVL is used by other navies because it is cheaper to operate and still provides good deployment capability for fighter aircraft .
In military affairs , the use of infantry with specialised roles increased . Along with the still-dominant heavy cavalry , armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen , as well as sappers and engineers . Crossbows , which had been known in Late Antiquity , increased in use partly because of the increase in siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries . [ AB ] The increasing use of crossbows during the 12th and 13th centuries led to the use of closed-face helmets , heavy body armour , as well as horse armour . Gunpowder was known in Europe by the mid-13th century with a recorded use in European warfare by the English against the Scots in 1304 , although it was merely used as an explosive and not as a weapon . Cannon were being used for sieges in the 1320s , and hand-held guns were in use by the 1360s .
A very high resolution source may require more bandwidth than available in order to be transmitted without loss of fidelity . The lossy compression that is used in all digital HDTV storage and transmission systems will distort the received picture , when compared to the uncompressed source .
In 1971 , the United States Department of Health , Education , and Welfare approached Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Stan Lee to do a comic book story about drug abuse . Lee agreed and wrote a three-part Spider-Man story portraying drug use as dangerous and unglamorous . However , the industry 's self-censorship board , the Comics Code Authority , refused to approve the story because of the presence of narcotics , deeming the context of the story irrelevant . Lee , with Goodman 's approval , published the story regardless in The Amazing Spider-Man # 96–98 ( May–July 1971 ) , without the Comics Code seal . The market reacted well to the storyline , and the CCA subsequently revised the Code the same year .
The SASO consists of 12 questions . Six of these questions assess sexual attraction , four assess sexual behavior , and two assess sexual orientation identity . For each question on the scale that measures homosexuality there is a corresponding question that measures heterosexuality giving six matching pairs of questions . Taken all together , the six pairs of questions and responses provide a profile of an individual 's sexual orientation . However , results can be further simplified into four summaries that look specifically at responses that correspond to either homosexuality , heterosexuality , bisexuality or asexuality .
Under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin , the Bolsheviks established the Soviet state on 7 November [ O.S . 25 October ] 1917 , immediately after the Russian Provisional Government , which governed the Russian Republic , was overthrown during the October Revolution . Initially , the state did not have an official name and was n't recognized by neighboring countries for five months . Meanwhile , anti-Bolsheviks coined the mocking label " Sovdepia " for the nascent state of the " Soviets of Workers ' and Peasants ' Deputies " .
Frederick II of Prussia had received reports of the clashes in North America and had formed an alliance with Great Britain . On 29 August 1756 , he led Prussian troops across the border of Saxony , one of the small German states in league with Austria . He intended this as a bold pre-emption of an anticipated Austro-French invasion of Silesia . He had three goals in his new war on Austria . First , he would seize Saxony and eliminate it as a threat to Prussia , then using the Saxon army and treasury to aid the Prussian war effort . His second goal was to advance into Bohemia where he might set up winter quarters at Austria 's expense . Thirdly , he wanted to invade Moravia from Silesia , seize the fortress at Olmütz , and advance on Vienna to force an end to the war .
Dogs have lived and worked with humans in so many roles that they have earned the unique nickname , " man 's best friend " , a phrase used in other languages as well . They have been bred for herding livestock , hunting ( e.g . pointers and hounds ) , rodent control , guarding , helping fishermen with nets , detection dogs , and pulling loads , in addition to their roles as companions . In 1957 , a husky-terrier mix named Laika became the first animal to orbit the Earth .
London is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world and in 2015 was ranked as the most visited city in the world with over 65 million visits . It is also the top city in the world by visitor cross-border spending , estimated at US $ 20.23 billion in 2015 Tourism is one of London 's prime industries , employing the equivalent of 350,000 full-time workers in 2003 , and the city accounts for 54 % of all inbound visitor spend in UK . As of 2016 London is rated as the world top ranked city destination by TripAdvisor users .
Children working at a young age has been a consistent theme throughout Africa . Many children began first working in the home to help their parents run the family farm . Children in Africa today are often forced into exploitative labour due to family debt and other financial factors , leading to ongoing poverty . Other types of domestic child labour include working in commercial plantations , begging , and other sales such as boot shining . In total , there is an estimated five million children who are currently working in the field of agriculture which steadily increases during the time of harvest . Along with 30 percent of children who are picking coffee , there are an estimated 25,000 school age children who work year round .
Filming started in Austria in December 2014 , with production taking in the area around Sölden—including the Ötztal Glacier Road , Rettenbach glacier and the adjacent ski resort and cable car station—and Obertilliach and Lake Altaussee , before concluding in February 2015 . Scenes filmed in Austria centred on the Ice Q Restaurant , standing in for the fictional Hoffler Klinik , a private medical clinic in the Austrian Alps . Filming included an action scene featuring a Land Rover Defender Bigfoot and a Range Rover Sport . Production was temporarily halted first by an injury to Craig , who sprained his knee whilst shooting a fight scene , and later by an accident involving a filming vehicle that saw three crew members injured , at least one of them seriously .
From 2000 to 2010 , the average cost per asthma-related hospital stay in the United States for children remained relatively stable at about $ 3,600 , whereas the average cost per asthma-related hospital stay for adults increased from $ 5,200 to $ 6,600 . In 2010 , Medicaid was the most frequent primary payer among children and adults aged 18–44 years in the United States ; private insurance was the second most frequent payer . Among both children and adults in the lowest income communities in the United States there is a higher rates of hospital stays for asthma in 2010 than those in the highest income communities .
Since the late 18th century , Paris has been famous for its restaurants and haute cuisine , food meticulously prepared and artfully presented . A luxury restaurant , La Taverne Anglaise , opened in 1786 in the arcades of the Palais-Royal by Antoine Beauvilliers ; it featured an elegant dining room , an extensive menu , linen tablecloths , a large wine list and well-trained waiters ; it became a model for future Paris restaurants . The restaurant Le Grand Véfour in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period . The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century , including the Café de Paris , the Rocher de Cancale , the Café Anglais , Maison Dorée and the Café Riche , were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens ; they were immortalised in the novels of Balzac and Émile Zola . Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the Belle Epoque , including Maxim 's on Rue Royale , Ledoyen in the gardens of the Champs-Élysées , and the Tour d'Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle .
The small landowner-cultivators formed the majority of the Han tax base ; this revenue was threatened during the latter half of Eastern Han when many peasants fell into debt and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy landlords . The Han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner-cultivators out of debt and on their own farms . These reforms included reducing taxes , temporary remissions of taxes , granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary lodging and work in agricultural colonies until they could recover from their debts .
Also in Carrasco is The British Schools of Montevideo , one of the oldest educational institutions in the country , established in 1908 . [ citation needed ] Its original purpose was to give Uruguayan children a complete education , on par with the best schools of the United Kingdom and to establish strong bonds between the British and Uruguayan children living in the country . The School is governed by the Board of Governors , elected by the British Schools Society in Uruguay , whose honorary president is the British Ambassador to Uruguay . Prominent alumni include former government ministers Pedro Bordaberry Herrán and Gabriel Gurméndez Armand-Ugon .
Yale 's museum collections are also of international stature . The Yale University Art Gallery , the country 's first university-affiliated art museum , contains more than 180,000 works , including Old Masters and important collections of modern art , in the Swartout and Kahn buildings . The latter , Louis Kahn 's first large-scale American work ( 1953 ) , was renovated and reopened in December 2006 . The Yale Center for British Art , the largest collection of British art outside of the UK , grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building .
Even though the book had barely hinted at human evolution , it quickly became central to the debate as mental and moral qualities were seen as spiritual aspects of the immaterial soul , and it was believed that animals did not have spiritual qualities . This conflict could be reconciled by supposing there was some supernatural intervention on the path leading to humans , or viewing evolution as a purposeful and progressive ascent to mankind 's position at the head of nature . While many conservative theologians accepted evolution , Charles Hodge argued in his 1874 critique " What is Darwinism ? " that " Darwinism " , defined narrowly as including rejection of design , was atheism though he accepted that Asa Gray did not reject design . Asa Gray responded that this charge misrepresented Darwin 's text . By the early 20th century , four noted authors of The Fundamentals were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through evolution , but fundamentalism inspired the American creation–evolution controversy that began in the 1920s . Some conservative Roman Catholic writers and influential Jesuits opposed evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century , but other Catholic writers , starting with Mivart , pointed out that early Church Fathers had not interpreted Genesis literally in this area . The Vatican stated its official position in a 1950 papal encyclical , which held that evolution was not inconsistent with Catholic teaching .
Development Testing is a software development process that involves synchronized application of a broad spectrum of defect prevention and detection strategies in order to reduce software development risks , time , and costs . It is performed by the software developer or engineer during the construction phase of the software development lifecycle . Rather than replace traditional QA focuses , it augments it . Development Testing aims to eliminate construction errors before code is promoted to QA ; this strategy is intended to increase the quality of the resulting software as well as the efficiency of the overall development and QA process .
In 1903 , Brigham Young Academy was dissolved , and was replaced by two institutions : Brigham Young High School , and Brigham Young University . ( The BY High School class of 1907 was ultimately responsible for the famous giant " Y " that is to this day embedded on a mountain near campus . ) The Board elected George H. Brimhall as the new President of BYU . He had not received a high school education until he was forty . Nevertheless , he was an excellent orator and organizer . Under his tenure in 1904 the new Brigham Young University bought 17 acres ( 69,000 m2 ) of land from Provo called " Temple Hill " . After some controversy among locals over BYU 's purchase of this property , construction began in 1909 on the first building on the current campus , the Karl G. Maeser Memorial . Brimhall also presided over the University during a brief crisis involving the theory of evolution . The religious nature of the school seemed at the time to collide with this scientific theory . Joseph F. Smith , LDS Church president , settled the question for a time by asking that evolution not be taught at the school . A few have described the school at this time as nothing more than a " religious seminary " . However , many of its graduates at this time would go on to great success and become well renowned in their fields .
John , the youngest of five sons of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine , was at first not expected to inherit significant lands . Following the failed rebellion of his elder brothers between 1173 and 1174 , however , John became Henry 's favourite child . He was appointed the Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent . John 's elder brothers William , Henry and Geoffrey died young ; by the time Richard I became king in 1189 , John was a potential heir to the throne . John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against Richard 's royal administrators whilst his brother was participating in the Third Crusade . Despite this , after Richard died in 1199 , John was proclaimed King of England , and came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise John 's possession of the continental Angevin lands at the peace treaty of Le Goulet in 1200 .
Islam is the most widely practised religion in Southeast Asia , numbering approximately 240 million adherents which translate to about 40 % of the entire population , with majorities in Indonesia , Brunei , Malaysia and in Southern Philippines with Indonesia as the largest and most populated Muslim country around the world . Countries in Southeast Asia practice many different religions . Buddhism is predominant in Thailand , Cambodia , Laos , Burma , Vietnam and Singapore . Ancestor worship and Confucianism are also widely practised in Vietnam and Singapore . Christianity is predominant in the Philippines , eastern Indonesia , East Malaysia and East Timor . The Philippines has the largest Roman Catholic population in Asia . East Timor is also predominantly Roman Catholic due to a history of Portuguese rule .
Some other cultures do not recognize a homosexual/heterosexual/bisexual distinction . It is common to distinguish a person 's sexuality according to their sexual role ( active/passive ; insertive/penetrated ) . In this distinction , the passive role is typically associated with femininity and/or inferiority , while the active role is typically associated with masculinity and/or superiority . For example , an investigation of a small Brazilian fishing village revealed three sexual categories for men : men who have sex only with men ( consistently in a passive role ) , men who have sex only with women , and men who have sex with women and men ( consistently in an active role ) . While men who consistently occupied the passive role were recognized as a distinct group by locals , men who have sex with only women , and men who have sex with women and men , were not differentiated . Little is known about same-sex attracted females , or sexual behavior between females in these cultures .
This growing coalition expanded the potential enemies that Rome might face , and moved Rome closer to confrontation with major powers . The result was more alliance-seeking , on the part of both the Roman confederacy and city-states seeking membership ( and protection ) within that confederacy . While there were exceptions to this ( such as military rule of Sicily after the First Punic War ) , it was not until after the Second Punic War that these alliances started to harden into something more like an empire , at least in certain locations . This shift mainly took place in parts of the west , such as the southern Italian towns that sided with Hannibal .
It is easy for Western-educated scholars to fall into the trap of viewing hunter-gatherer social and sexual arrangements in the light of Western values . [ editorializing ] One common arrangement is the sexual division of labour , with women doing most of the gathering , while men concentrate on big game hunting . It might be imagined that this arrangement oppresses women , keeping them in the domestic sphere . However , according to some observers , hunter-gatherer women would not understand this interpretation . Since childcare is collective , with every baby having multiple mothers and male carers , the domestic sphere is not atomised or privatised but an empowering place to be . [ citation needed ] In all hunter-gatherer societies , women appreciate the meat brought back to camp by men . An illustrative account is Megan Biesele 's study of the southern African Ju/'hoan , 'Women Like Meat ' . Recent archaeological research suggests that the sexual division of labor was the fundamental organisational innovation that gave Homo sapiens the edge over the Neanderthals , allowing our ancestors to migrate from Africa and spread across the globe .
The largest single execution in United States history was the hanging of 38 American Indians convicted of murder and rape during the Dakota War of 1862 . They were executed simultaneously on December 26 , 1862 , in Mankato , Minnesota . A single blow from an axe cut the rope that held the large four-sided platform , and the prisoners ( except for one whose rope had broken and who had to be re-hanged ) fell to their deaths . The second-largest mass execution was also a hanging : the execution of 13 African-American soldiers for taking part in the Houston Riot of 1917 . The largest non-military mass execution occurred in one of the original thirteen colonies in 1723 , when 26 convicted pirates were hanged in Newport , Rhode Island by order of the Admiralty Court .
In December 1831 , he joined the Beagle expedition as a gentleman naturalist and geologist . He read Charles Lyell 's Principles of Geology and from the first stop ashore , at St. Jago , found Lyell 's uniformitarianism a key to the geological history of landscapes . Darwin discovered fossils resembling huge armadillos , and noted the geographical distribution of modern species in hope of finding their " centre of creation " . The three Fuegian missionaries the expedition returned to Tierra del Fuego were friendly and civilised , yet to Darwin their relatives on the island seemed " miserable , degraded savages " , and he no longer saw an unbridgeable gap between humans and animals . As the Beagle neared England in 1836 , he noted that species might not be fixed .
Sichuan has been historically known as the " Province of Abundance " . It is one of the major agricultural production bases of China . Grain , including rice and wheat , is the major product with output that ranked first in China in 1999 . Commercial crops include citrus fruits , sugar cane , sweet potatoes , peaches and grapes . Sichuan also had the largest output of pork among all the provinces and the second largest output of silkworm cocoons in 1999 . Sichuan is rich in mineral resources . It has more than 132 kinds of proven underground mineral resources including vanadium , titanium , and lithium being the largest in China . The Panxi region alone possesses 13.3 % of the reserves of iron , 93 % of titanium , 69 % of vanadium , and 83 % of the cobalt of the whole country . Sichuan also possesses China 's largest proven natural gas reserves , the majority of which is transported to more developed eastern regions .
The languages have not undergone the deliberate highlighting of minor linguistic differences in the name of nationalism as has occurred in the Bosnian , Serbian and Croatian standards of Serbo-Croatian . However , most Slavic languages ( including Czech ) have been distanced in this way from Russian influences because of widespread public resentment against the former Soviet Union ( which occupied Czechoslovakia in 1968 ) . Czech and Slovak form a dialect continuum , with great similarity between neighboring Czech and Slovak dialects . ( See " Dialects " below . )
During the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism , much of London passing from church to private ownership . The traffic in woollen cloths shipped undyed and undressed from London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries , where it was considered indispensable . But the tentacles of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe . The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps ; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan . Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565 , there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity . The Royal Exchange was founded . Mercantilism grew , and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established , with trade expanding to the New World . London became the principal North Sea port , with migrants arriving from England and abroad . The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605 .
A unit load is defined as 100 mA in USB 1.x and 2.0 , and 150 mA in USB 3.0 . A device may draw a maximum of five unit loads from a port in USB 1.x and 2.0 ( 500 mA ) , or six unit loads in USB 3.0 ( 900 mA ) . There are two types of devices : low-power and high-power . A low-power device ( such as a USB HID ) draws at most one-unit load , with minimum operating voltage of 4.4 V in USB 2.0 , and 4 V in USB 3.0 . A high-power device draws , at most , the maximum number of unit loads the standard permits . Every device functions initially as low-power ( including high-power functions during their low-power enumeration phases ) , but may request high-power , and get it if available on the providing bus .
Another example relates to AIG , which insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps . The basic CDS transaction involved AIG receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party A in the event party B defaulted . However , AIG did not have the financial strength to support its many CDS commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in September 2008 . U.S. taxpayers provided over $ 180 billion in government support to AIG during 2008 and early 2009 , through which the money flowed to various counterparties to CDS transactions , including many large global financial institutions .
Until recently , in the absence of prior agreement on a clear and precise definition , the concept was thought to mean ( as a shorthand ) 'a division of sovereignty between two levels of government ' . New research , however , argues that this can not be correct , as dividing sovereignty - when this concept is properly understood in its core meaning of the final and absolute source of political authority in a political community - is not possible . The descent of the United States into Civil War in the mid-nineteenth century , over disputes about unallocated competences concerning slavery and ultimately the right of secession , showed this . One or other level of government could be sovereign to decide such matters , but not both simultaneously . Therefore , it is now suggested that federalism is more appropriately conceived as 'a division of the powers flowing from sovereignty between two levels of government ' . What differentiates the concept from other multi-level political forms is the characteristic of equality of standing between the two levels of government established . This clarified definition opens the way to identifying two distinct federal forms , where before only one was known , based upon whether sovereignty resides in the whole ( in one people ) or in the parts ( in many peoples ) : the federal state ( or federation ) and the federal union of states ( or federal union ) , respectively . Leading examples of the federal state include the United States , Germany , Canada , Switzerland , Australia and India . The leading example of the federal union of states is the European Union .
The Jenkins Orphanage was established in 1891 by the Rev . Daniel J. Jenkins in Charleston . The orphanage accepted donations of musical instruments and Rev . Jenkins hired local Charleston musicians and Avery Institute Graduates to tutor the boys in music . As a result , Charleston musicians became proficient on a variety of instruments and were able to read music expertly . These traits set Jenkins musicians apart and helped land some of them positions in big bands with Duke Ellington and Count Basie . William " Cat " Anderson , Jabbo Smith , and Freddie Green are but a few of the alumni from the Jenkins Orphanage band who became professional musicians in some of the best bands of the day . Orphanages around the country began to develop brass bands in the wake of the Jenkins Orphanage Band 's success . At the Colored Waif 's Home Brass Band in New Orleans , for example , a young trumpeter named Louis Armstrong first began to draw attention .
The United Nations Charter states that treaties must be registered with the UN to be invoked before it or enforced in its judiciary organ , the International Court of Justice . This was done to prevent the proliferation of secret treaties that occurred in the 19th and 20th century . Section 103 of the Charter also states that its members ' obligations under it outweigh any competing obligations under other treaties .
Von Neumann 's principal contribution to the atomic bomb was in the concept and design of the explosive lenses needed to compress the plutonium core of the Fat Man weapon that was later dropped on Nagasaki . While von Neumann did not originate the " implosion " concept , he was one of its most persistent proponents , encouraging its continued development against the instincts of many of his colleagues , who felt such a design to be unworkable . He also eventually came up with the idea of using more powerful shaped charges and less fissionable material to greatly increase the speed of " assembly " .
The 150th anniversary of Bell 's birth in 1997 was marked by a special issue of commemorative £1 banknotes from the Royal Bank of Scotland . The illustrations on the reverse of the note include Bell 's face in profile , his signature , and objects from Bell 's life and career : users of the telephone over the ages ; an audio wave signal ; a diagram of a telephone receiver ; geometric shapes from engineering structures ; representations of sign language and the phonetic alphabet ; the geese which helped him to understand flight ; and the sheep which he studied to understand genetics . Additionally , the Government of Canada honored Bell in 1997 with a C $ 100 gold coin , in tribute also to the 150th anniversary of his birth , and with a silver dollar coin in 2009 in honor of the 100th anniversary of flight in Canada . That first flight was made by an airplane designed under Dr. Bell 's tutelage , named the Silver Dart . Bell 's image , and also those of his many inventions have graced paper money , coinage and postal stamps in numerous countries worldwide for many dozens of years .
In its first century and half , the EIC used a few hundred soldiers as guards . The great expansion came after 1750 , when it had 3000 regular troops . By 1763 , it had 26,000 ; by 1778 , it had 67,000 . It recruited largely Indian troops , and trained them along European lines . The company , fresh from a colossal victory , and with the backing of its own private well-disciplined and experienced army , was able to assert its interests in the Carnatic region from its base at Madras and in Bengal from Calcutta , without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers .
Jewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets . Jewish law requires Jews to feed dogs ( and other animals that they own ) before themselves , and make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them . In Christianity , dogs represent faithfulness .
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the ultimate court for criminal and civil matters in England , Wales and Northern Ireland and for civil matters in Scotland . ( The supreme court for criminal matters in Scotland is the High Court of Justiciary . ) The Supreme Court was established by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 with effect from 1 October 2009 , replacing and assuming the judicial functions of the House of Lords . Devolution issues under the Scotland Act 1998 , Government of Wales Act and Northern Ireland Act were also transferred to the new Supreme Court by the Constitutional Reform Act , from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council .
East 2nd Street begins just North of East Houston Street at Avenue C and also continues to Bowery . The East end of East 3rd , 4th , 5th , and 7th Streets is Avenue D , with East 6th Street continuing further Eastward and connecting to FDR Drive .
In 2012 , resident foreigners made up 23.3 % of the population . Most of these ( 64 % ) were from European Union or EFTA countries . Italians were the largest single group of foreigners with 15.6 % of total foreign population . They were closely followed by Germans ( 15.2 % ) , immigrants from Portugal ( 12.7 % ) , France ( 5.6 % ) , Serbia ( 5.3 % ) , Turkey ( 3.8 % ) , Spain ( 3.7 % ) , and Austria ( 2 % ) . Immigrants from Sri Lanka , most of them former Tamil refugees , were the largest group among people of Asian origin ( 6.3 % ) . Additionally , the figures from 2012 show that 34.7 % of the permanent resident population aged 15 or over in Switzerland , i.e . 2,335,000 persons , had an immigrant background . A third of this population ( 853,000 ) held Swiss citizenship . Four fifths of persons with an immigration background were themselves immigrants ( first generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens ) , whereas one fifth were born in Switzerland ( second generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens ) . In the 2000s , domestic and international institutions expressed concern about what they perceived as an increase in xenophobia , particularly in some political campaigns . In reply to one critical report the Federal Council noted that " racism unfortunately is present in Switzerland " , but stated that the high proportion of foreign citizens in the country , as well as the generally unproblematic integration of foreigners " , underlined Switzerland 's openness .
In an effort at revitalizing the city , New Jersey voters in 1976 passed a referendum , approving casino gambling for Atlantic City ; this came after a 1974 referendum on legalized gambling failed to pass . Immediately after the legislation passed , the owners of the Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel began converting it into the Resorts International . It was the first legal casino in the eastern United States when it opened on May 26 , 1978 . Other casinos were soon constructed along the Boardwalk and , later , in the marina district for a total of eleven today . The introduction of gambling did not , however , quickly eliminate many of the urban problems that plagued Atlantic City . Many people have suggested that it only served to exacerbate those problems , as attested to by the stark contrast between tourism intensive areas and the adjacent impoverished working-class neighborhoods . In addition , Atlantic City has been less popular than Las Vegas , as a gambling city in the United States . Donald Trump helped bring big name boxing bouts to the city to attract customers to his casinos . The boxer Mike Tyson had most of his fights in Atlantic City in the 1980s , which helped Atlantic City achieve nationwide attention as a gambling resort . Numerous highrise condominiums were built for use as permanent residences or second homes . By end of the decade it was one of the most popular tourist destinations in the United States .
The State of Israel is divided into six main administrative districts , known as mehozot ( מחוזות ; singular : mahoz ) – Center , Haifa , Jerusalem , North , Southern , and Tel Aviv Districts , as well as the Judea and Samaria Area in the West Bank . All of the Judea and Samaria Area and parts of the Jerusalem and North districts are not recognized internationally as part of Israel . Districts are further divided into fifteen sub-districts known as nafot ( נפות ; singular : nafa ) , which are themselves partitioned into fifty natural regions .

Effective verbal or spoken communication is dependent on a number of factors and can not be fully isolated from other important interpersonal skills such as non-verbal communication , listening skills and clarification . Human language can be defined as a system of symbols ( sometimes known as lexemes ) and the grammars ( rules ) by which the symbols are manipulated . The word " language " also refers to common properties of languages . Language learning normally occurs most intensively during human childhood . Most of the thousands of human languages use patterns of sound or gesture for symbols which enable communication with others around them . Languages tend to share certain properties , although there are exceptions . There is no defined line between a language and a dialect . Constructed languages such as Esperanto , programming languages , and various mathematical formalism is not necessarily restricted to the properties shared by human languages . Communication is two-way process not merely one-way .
Having initially announced a new album entitled So Help Me God slated for a 2014 release , in March 2015 West announced that the album would instead be tentatively called SWISH . Later that month , West was awarded an honorary doctorate by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for his contributions to music , fashion , and popular culture , officially making him an honorary DFA . The next month , West headlined at the Glastonbury Festival in the UK , despite a petition signed by almost 135,000 people against his appearance . At one point , he told the audience : " You are now watching the greatest living rock star on the planet . " Media outlets , including social media sites such as Twitter , were sharply divided on his performance . NME stated , " The decision to book West for the slot has proved controversial since its announcement , and the show itself appeared to polarise both Glastonbury goers and those who tuned in to watch on their TVs . " The publication added that " he 's letting his music speak for and prove itself . " The Guardian said that " his set has a potent ferocity – but there are gaps and stutters , and he cuts a strangely lone figure in front of the vast crowd . "
Native American music in North America is almost entirely monophonic , but there are notable exceptions . Traditional Native American music often centers around drumming . Rattles , clappersticks , and rasps were also popular percussive instruments . Flutes were made of rivercane , cedar , and other woods . The tuning of these flutes is not precise and depends on the length of the wood used and the hand span of the intended player , but the finger holes are most often around a whole step apart and , at least in Northern California , a flute was not used if it turned out to have an interval close to a half step . The Apache fiddle is a single stringed instrument .
For centuries , Jews worldwide have spoken the local or dominant languages of the regions they migrated to , often developing distinctive dialectal forms or branches that became independent languages . Yiddish is the Judæo-German language developed by Ashkenazi Jews who migrated to Central Europe . Ladino is the Judæo-Spanish language developed by Sephardic Jews who migrated to the Iberian peninsula . Due to many factors , including the impact of the Holocaust on European Jewry , the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries , and widespread emigration from other Jewish communities around the world , ancient and distinct Jewish languages of several communities , including Judæo-Georgian , Judæo-Arabic , Judæo-Berber , Krymchak , Judæo-Malayalam and many others , have largely fallen out of use .
Between the 1992–93 season and the 2012–13 season , Premier League clubs had won the UEFA Champions League four times ( as well as supplying five of the runners-up ) , behind Spain 's La Liga with six wins , and Italy 's Serie A with five wins , and ahead of , among others , Germany 's Bundesliga with three wins ( see table here ) . The FIFA Club World Cup ( or the FIFA Club World Championship , as it was originally called ) has been won by Premier league clubs once ( Manchester United in 2008 ) , and they have also been runners-up twice , behind Brazil 's Brasileirão with four wins , and Spain 's La Liga and Italy 's Serie A with two wins each ( see table here ) .
Following the events in Olympia , there were reports that China requested permission to deploy People 's Liberation Army personnel along the relay route to protect the flame in Canberra . Australian authorities stated that such a request , if it were to be made , would be refused . Chinese officials labeled it a rumor . Australian police have been given powers to search relay spectators , following a call by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association for Chinese Australian students to " go defend our sacred torch " against " ethnic degenerate scum and anti-China separatists " . Tony Goh , chairman of the Australian Council of Chinese Organisations , has said the ACCO would be taking " thousands " of pro-Beijing demonstrators to Canberra by bus , to support the torch relay . Zhang Rongan , a Chinese Australian student organising pro-Beijing demonstrations , told the press that Chinese diplomats were assisting with the organization of buses , meals and accommodation for pro-Beijing demonstrators , and helping them organise a " peaceful show of strength " . Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said Chinese officials were urging supporters to " turn up and put a point of view " , but that he had no objection to it as long as they remained peaceful .
According to the U.S. Census Bureau , as of 2015 , Tennessee had an estimated population of 6,600,299 , which is an increase of 50,947 , from the prior year and an increase of 254,194 , or 4.01 % , since the year 2010 . This includes a natural increase since the last census of 142,266 people ( that is 493,881 births minus 351,615 deaths ) , and an increase from net migration of 219,551 people into the state . Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 59,385 people , and migration within the country produced a net increase of 160,166 people . Twenty percent of Tennesseans were born outside the South in 2008 , compared to a figure of 13.5 % in 1990 .
In 2006 , due to ongoing violence , over 50,000 people in the country 's northwest were at risk of starvation but this was averted due to assistance from the United Nations . [ citation needed ] On 8 January 2008 , the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon declared that the Central African Republic was eligible to receive assistance from the Peacebuilding Fund . Three priority areas were identified : first , the reform of the security sector ; second , the promotion of good governance and the rule of law ; and third , the revitalization of communities affected by conflicts . On 12 June 2008 , the Central African Republic requested assistance from the UN Peacebuilding Commission , which was set up in 2005 to help countries emerging from conflict avoid devolving back into war or chaos .
Spielberg followed with War Horse , shot in England in the summer of 2010 . It was released just four days after The Adventures of Tintin , on December 25 , 2011 . The film , based on the novel of the same name written by Michael Morpurgo and published in 1982 , follows the long friendship between a British boy and his horse Joey before and during World War I – the novel was also adapted into a hit play in London which is still running there , as well as on Broadway . The film was released and distributed by Disney , with whom DreamWorks made a distribution deal in 2009 . War Horse received generally positive reviews from critics , and was nominated for six Academy Awards , including Best Picture .
By 1790 , the Jewish population of Alsace was approximately 22,500 , about 3 % of the provincial population . They were highly segregated and subject to long-standing anti-Jewish regulations . They maintained their own customs , Yiddish language , and historic traditions within the tightly-knit ghettos ; they adhered to Talmudic law enforced by their rabbis . Jews were barred from most cities and instead lived in villages . They concentrated in trade , services , and especially in money lending . They financed about a third of the mortgages in Alsace . Official tolerance grew during the French Revolution , with full emancipation in 1791 . However , local antisemitism also increased and Napoleon turned hostile in 1806 , imposing a one-year moratorium on all debts owed to Jews . [ citation needed ] In the 1830-1870 era most Jews moved to the cities , where they integrated and acculturated , as antisemitism sharply declined . By 1831 , the state began paying salaries to official rabbis , and in 1846 a special legal oath for Jews was discontinued . Antisemitic local riots occasionally occurred , especially during the Revolution of 1848 . Merger of Alsace into Germany in 1871-1918 lessened antisemitic violence .
Rowing has been popular in Philadelphia since the 18th century . Boathouse Row is a symbol of Philadelphia 's rich rowing history , and each Big Five member has its own boathouse . Philadelphia hosts numerous local and collegiate rowing clubs and competitions , including the annual Dad Vail Regatta , the largest intercollegiate rowing event in the U.S , the Stotesbury Cup Regatta , and the Head of the Schuylkill Regatta , all of which are held on the Schuylkill River . The regattas are hosted and organized by the Schuylkill Navy , an association of area rowing clubs that has produced numerous Olympic rowers .
In December 1831 , he joined the Beagle expedition as a gentleman naturalist and geologist . He read Charles Lyell 's Principles of Geology and from the first stop ashore , at St. Jago , found Lyell 's uniformitarianism a key to the geological history of landscapes . Darwin discovered fossils resembling huge armadillos , and noted the geographical distribution of modern species in hope of finding their " centre of creation " . The three Fuegian missionaries the expedition returned to Tierra del Fuego were friendly and civilised , yet to Darwin their relatives on the island seemed " miserable , degraded savages " , and he no longer saw an unbridgeable gap between humans and animals . As the Beagle neared England in 1836 , he noted that species might not be fixed .
The iPod line can play several audio file formats including MP3 , AAC/M4A , Protected AAC , AIFF , WAV , Audible audiobook , and Apple Lossless . The iPod photo introduced the ability to display JPEG , BMP , GIF , TIFF , and PNG image file formats . Fifth and sixth generation iPod Classics , as well as third generation iPod Nanos , can additionally play MPEG-4 ( H.264/MPEG-4 AVC ) and QuickTime video formats , with restrictions on video dimensions , encoding techniques and data-rates . Originally , iPod software only worked with Mac OS ; iPod software for Microsoft Windows was launched with the second generation model . Unlike most other media players , Apple does not support Microsoft 's WMA audio format—but a converter for WMA files without Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) is provided with the Windows version of iTunes . MIDI files also can not be played , but can be converted to audio files using the " Advanced " menu in iTunes . Alternative open-source audio formats , such as Ogg Vorbis and FLAC , are not supported without installing custom firmware onto an iPod ( e.g. , Rockbox ) .
A format called quiet storm is often included in urban adult contemporary , and is often played during the evening , blending the urban AC and soft AC styles of music . The music that is played is strictly ballads and slow jams , mostly but not limited to Black and Latino artists . Popular artists in the quiet storm format are Teena Marie , Freddie Jackson , Johnny Gill , Lalah Hathaway , Vanessa L. Williams , Toni Braxton , and En Vogue among others .
The BBC reported that France was the first journalist to face trial and be convicted under Operation Elveden since the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) had revised its guidance in April 2015 so that prosecutions would only be brought against journalists who had made payments to police officers over a period of time . As a result of the change in the CPS’ policy , charges against several journalists who had made payments to other types of public officials – including civil servants , health workers and prison staff - had been dropped . In July 2015 , Private Eye magazine reported that at a costs hearing at the Old Bailey The Sun 's parent company had refused to pay for the prosecution costs relating to France’s trial , leading the presiding judge to express his " considerable disappointment " at this state of affairs . Judge Timothy Pontius said in court that France’s illegal actions had been part of a " clearly recognised procedure at The Sun " , adding that , " There can be no doubt that News International bears some measure of moral responsibility if not legal culpability for the acts of the defendant " . The Private Eye report noted that despite this The Sun 's parent organisation was " considering disciplinary actions " against France whilst at the same time it was also preparing to bring a case to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal against the London Metropolitan Police Service for its actions relating to him and two other journalists .
As economic and demographic methods were applied to the study of history , the trend was increasingly to see the late Middle Ages as a period of recession and crisis . Belgian historian Henri Pirenne continued the subdivision of Early , High , and Late Middle Ages in the years around World War I . Yet it was his Dutch colleague , Johan Huizinga , who was primarily responsible for popularising the pessimistic view of the Late Middle Ages , with his book The Autumn of the Middle Ages ( 1919 ) . To Huizinga , whose research focused on France and the Low Countries rather than Italy , despair and decline were the main themes , not rebirth .
The traditional energy supply of Thuringia is lignite , mined in the bordering Leipzig region . Since 2000 , the importance of environmentally unfriendly lignite combustion has declined in favour of renewable energies , which reached an amount of 40 % ( in 2013 ) , and more clean gas combustion , often carried out as Cogeneration in the municipal power stations . The most important forms of renewable energies are Wind power and Biomass , followed by Solar energy and Hydroelectricity . Furthermore , Thuringia hosts two big pumped storage stations : the Goldisthal Pumped Storage Station and the Hohenwarte Dam .
The Islamic Golden Age coincided with the Middle Ages in the Muslim world , starting with the rise of Islam and establishment of the first Islamic state in 622 . The end of the age is variously given as 1258 with the Mongolian Sack of Baghdad , or 1492 with the completion of the Christian Reconquista of the Emirate of Granada in Al-Andalus , Iberian Peninsula . During the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun ar-Rashid ( 786 to 809 ) , the legendary House of Wisdom was inaugurated in Baghdad where scholars from various parts of the world sought to translate and gather all the known world 's knowledge into Arabic . The Abbasids were influenced by the Quranic injunctions and hadiths , such as " the ink of a scholar is more holy than the blood of a martyr , " that stressed the value of knowledge . The major Islamic capital cities of Baghdad , Cairo , and Córdoba became the main intellectual centers for science , philosophy , medicine , and education . During this period , the Muslim world was a collection of cultures ; they drew together and advanced the knowledge gained from the ancient Greek , Roman , Persian , Chinese , Indian , Egyptian , and Phoenician civilizations .
People of all ages attend , and many often move on to becoming imams . [ citation needed ] The certificate of an ʻālim , for example , requires approximately twelve years of study . [ citation needed ] A good number of the ḥuffāẓ ( plural of ḥāfiẓ ) are the product of the madaris . The madaris also resemble colleges , where people take evening classes and reside in dormitories . An important function of the madaris is to admit orphans and poor children in order to provide them with education and training . Madaris may enroll female students ; however , they study separately from the men . [ citation needed ]
Another recent environmental issue in Melbourne was the Victorian government project of channel deepening Melbourne Ports by dredging Port Phillip Bay—the Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project . It was subject to controversy and strict regulations among fears that beaches and marine wildlife could be affected by the disturbance of heavy metals and other industrial sediments . Other major pollution problems in Melbourne include levels of bacteria including E. coli in the Yarra River and its tributaries caused by septic systems , as well as litter . Up to 350,000 cigarette butts enter the storm water runoff every day . Several programs are being implemented to minimise beach and river pollution . In February 2010 , The Transition Decade , an initiative to transition human society , economics and environment towards sustainability , was launched in Melbourne .
Darwin had initially decided to call his book An abstract of an Essay on the Origin of Species and Varieties Through natural selection , but with Murray 's persuasion it was eventually changed to the snappier title : On the Origin of Species , with the title page adding by Means of Natural Selection , or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life . Here the term " races " is used as an alternative for " varieties " and does not carry the modern connotation of human races—the first use in the book refers to " the several races , for instance , of the cabbage " and proceeds to a discussion of " the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants " .
Cockroaches are among the fastest insect runners and , at full speed , adopt a bipedal run to reach a high velocity in proportion to their body size . As cockroaches move very quickly , they need to be video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait . More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks ( Phasmatodea ) . A few insects have evolved to walk on the surface of the water , especially members of the Gerridae family , commonly known as water striders . A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans , a habitat that has few insect species .
Friedrich Hayek CH ( German : [ ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈaʊ̯ɡʊst ˈhaɪ̯ɛk ] ; 8 May 1899 – 23 March 1992 ) , born in Austria-Hungary as Friedrich August von Hayek and frequently referred to as F. A. Hayek , was an Austrian and British economist and philosopher best known for his defense of classical liberalism . Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for his " pioneering work in the theory of money and economic fluctuations and ... penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic , social and institutional phenomena . "
After a lengthy period of formal racial segregation in the former Confederacy following the Reconstruction Era , and bans on interracial marriage in various parts of the country , more people are openly forming interracial unions . In addition , social conditions have changed and many multiracial people do not believe it is socially advantageous to try to " pass " as white . Diverse immigration has brought more mixed-race people into the United States , such as the large population of Hispanics identifying as mestizos . Since the 1980s , the United States has had a growing multiracial identity movement ( cf . Loving Day ) . Because more Americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins , the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one ethno-racial identity and thereby identify as multiracial . In 2008 Barack Obama was elected as the first multiracial President of the United States ; he acknowledges both sides of his family and identifies as African American .
Commentaries dealing with the zahir ( outward aspects ) of the text are called tafsir , and hermeneutic and esoteric commentaries dealing with the batin are called ta'wil ( " interpretation " or " explanation " ) , which involves taking the text back to its beginning . Commentators with an esoteric slant believe that the ultimate meaning of the Quran is known only to God . In contrast , Quranic literalism , followed by Salafis and Zahiris , is the belief that the Quran should only be taken at its apparent meaning . [ citation needed ]
Many causes for the financial crisis have been suggested , with varying weight assigned by experts . The U.S. Senate 's Levin–Coburn Report concluded that the crisis was the result of " high risk , complex financial products ; undisclosed conflicts of interest ; the failure of regulators , the credit rating agencies , and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street . " The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by " widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision " , " dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions " , " a combination of excessive borrowing , risky investments , and lack of transparency " by financial institutions , ill preparation and inconsistent action by government that " added to the uncertainty and panic " , a " systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics " , " collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline " , deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives , especially credit default swaps , and " the failures of credit rating agencies " to correctly price risk . The 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the United States . Critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products , and that governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address 21st-century financial markets . Research into the causes of the financial crisis has also focused on the role of interest rate spreads .
Kerry established a separate political action committee , Keeping America 's Promise , which declared as its mandate " A Democratic Congress will restore accountability to Washington and help change a disastrous course in Iraq " , and raised money and channeled contributions to Democratic candidates in state and federal races . Through Keeping America 's Promise in 2005 , Kerry raised over $ 5.5 million for other Democrats up and down the ballot . Through his campaign account and his political action committee , the Kerry campaign operation generated more than $ 10 million for various party committees and 179 candidates for the U.S. House , Senate , state and local offices in 42 states focusing on the midterm elections during the 2006 election cycle . " Cumulatively , John Kerry has done as much if not more than any other individual senator " , Hassan Nemazee , the national finance chairman of the DSCC said .
According to historian Shaye J. D. Cohen , the status of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined patrilineally in the Bible . He brings two likely explanations for the change in Mishnaic times : first , the Mishnah may have been applying the same logic to mixed marriages as it had applied to other mixtures ( Kil'ayim ) . Thus , a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a horse and a donkey , and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally . Second , the Tannaim may have been influenced by Roman law , which dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage , offspring would follow the mother .
Widowed in 1861 , the grief-stricken Queen withdrew from public life and left Buckingham Palace to live at Windsor Castle , Balmoral Castle and Osborne House . For many years the palace was seldom used , even neglected . In 1864 , a note was found pinned to the fence of Buckingham Palace , saying : " These commanding premises to be let or sold , in consequence of the late occupant 's declining business . " Eventually , public opinion forced the Queen to return to London , though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible . Court functions were still held at Windsor Castle , presided over by the sombre Queen habitually dressed in mourning black , while Buckingham Palace remained shuttered for most of the year .
Southeast Tucson continues to experience rapid residential development . The area includes Davis-Monthan Air Force Base . The area is considered to be south of Golf Links Road . It is the home of Santa Rita High School , Chuck Ford Park ( Lakeside Park ) , Lakeside Lake , Lincoln Park ( upper and lower ) , The Lakecrest Neighborhoods , and Pima Community College East Campus . The Atterbury Wash with its access to excellent bird watching is also located in the Southeast Tucson area . The suburban community of Rita Ranch houses many of the military families from Davis-Monthan , and is near the southeastern-most expansion of the current city limits . Close by Rita Ranch and also within the city limits lies Civano , a planned development meant to showcase ecologically sound building practices and lifestyles .
Other stories result from a natural rivalry between two or more characters . Outside of performance , these are referred to as feuds . A feud can exist between any number of participants and can last for a few days up to multiple decades . The feud between Ric Flair and Ricky Steamboat lasted from the late 1970s into the early 1990s and allegedly spanned over two thousand matches ( although most of those matches were mere dark matches ) . The career-spanning history between characters Mike Awesome and Masato Tanaka is another example of a long-running feud , as is the case of Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Mr. McMahon , one of the most lucrative feuds in the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) during 1998 and 1999 .
In 1986 , the Compact of Free Association with the United States entered into force , granting the Republic of the Marshall Islands ( RMI ) its sovereignty . The Compact provided for aid and U.S. defense of the islands in exchange for continued U.S. military use of the missile testing range at Kwajalein Atoll . The independence procedure was formally completed under international law in 1990 , when the UN officially ended the Trusteeship status pursuant to Security Council Resolution 683 .
Literary Catalan allows the use of words from different dialects , except those of very restricted use . However , from the 19th century onwards , there is a tendency of favoring words of Northern dialects in detriment of others , even though nowadays there is a greater freedom of choice .
The name evolved during the Middle Ages from Gallaecia , sometimes written Galletia , to Gallicia . In the 13th century , with the written emergence of the Galician language , Galiza became the most usual written form of the name of the country , being replaced during the 15th and 16th centuries by the current form , Galicia , which coincides with the Castilian Spanish name . The historical denomination Galiza became popular again during the end of the 19th and the first three-quarters of the 20th century , being still used with some frequency today , although not by the Xunta de Galicia , the local devolved government . The Royal Galician Academy , the institution responsible for regulating the Galician language , whilst recognizing it as a legitimate current denomination , has stated that the only official name of the country is Galicia .
In recent decades , a series of inscribed graphs and pictures have been found at Neolithic sites in China , including Jiahu ( c. 6500 BC ) , Dadiwan and Damaidi from the 6th millennium BC , and Banpo ( 5th millennium BC ) . Often these finds are accompanied by media reports that push back the purported beginnings of Chinese writing by thousands of years . However , because these marks occur singly , without any implied context , and are made crudely and simply , Qiu Xigui concluded that " we do not have any basis for stating that these constituted writing nor is there reason to conclude that they were ancestral to Shang dynasty Chinese characters . " They do however demonstrate a history of sign use in the Yellow River valley during the Neolithic through to the Shang period .
Armies typically have air defence in depth , from integral MANPADS such as the RBS 70 , Stinger and Igla at smaller force levels up to army-level missile defence systems such as Angara and Patriot . Often , the high-altitude long-range missile systems force aircraft to fly at low level , where anti-aircraft guns can bring them down . As well as the small and large systems , for effective air defence there must be intermediate systems . These may be deployed at regiment-level and consist of platoons of self-propelled anti-aircraft platforms , whether they are self-propelled anti-aircraft guns ( SPAAGs ) , integrated air-defence systems like Tunguska or all-in-one surface-to-air missile platforms like Roland or SA-8 Gecko .
RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it , but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes , therefore the CPU can only read from it . ROM is typically used to store the computer 's initial start-up instructions . In general , the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off , but ROM retains its data indefinitely . In a PC , the ROM contains a specialized program called the BIOS that orchestrates loading the computer 's operating system from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset . In embedded computers , which frequently do not have disk drives , all of the required software may be stored in ROM . Software stored in ROM is often called firmware , because it is notionally more like hardware than software . Flash memory blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM , as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable . It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however , so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary .
In 1348 and 1349 Portugal , like the rest of Europe , was devastated by the Black Death . In 1373 , Portugal made an alliance with England , which is the longest-standing alliance in the world . This alliance served both nations ' interests throughout history and is regarded by many as the predecessor to NATO . Over time this went way beyond geo-political and military cooperation ( protecting both nations ' interests in Africa , the Americas and Asia against French , Spanish and Dutch rivals ) and maintained strong trade and cultural ties between the two old European allies . Particularly in the Oporto region , there is visible English influence to this day .
The effects of local surface low pressure are extremely limited because upper-level subsidence still continues to block any form of air ascent . Also , to be protected against rain-bearing weather systems by the atmospheric circulation itself , the desert is made even drier by his geographical configuration and location . Indeed , the extreme aridity of the Sahara ca n't be only explained by the subtropical high pressure . The Atlas Mountains , found in Algeria , Morocco and Tunisia also help to enhance the aridity of the northern part of the desert . These major mountain ranges act as a barrier causing a strong rain shadow effect on the leeward side by dropping much of the humidity brought by atmospheric disturbances along the polar front which affects the surrounding Mediterranean climates .
The Hummers that Schwarzenegger bought 1992 are so large – each weighs 6,300 lb ( 2,900 kg ) and is 7 feet ( 2.1 m ) wide – that they are classified as large trucks , and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to them . During the gubernatorial recall campaign he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen . The conversion was reported to have cost about US $ 21,000 . After the election , he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the California Hydrogen Highway Network , and gained a U.S. Department of Energy grant to help pay for its projected US $ 91,000,000 cost . California took delivery of the first H2H ( Hydrogen Hummer ) in October 2004 .
New Mexico is commonly thought to have Spanish as an official language alongside English because of its wide usage and legal promotion of Spanish in the state ; however , the state has no official language . New Mexico 's laws are promulgated bilingually in Spanish and English . Although English is the state government 's paper working language , government business is often conducted in Spanish , particularly at the local level . Spanish has been spoken in the New Mexico-Colorado border and the contemporary U.S.–Mexico border since the 16th century . [ citation needed ]
Two days after the marriage , Bonaparte left Paris to take command of the Army of Italy . He immediately went on the offensive , hoping to defeat the forces of Piedmont before their Austrian allies could intervene . In a series of rapid victories during the Montenotte Campaign , he knocked Piedmont out of the war in two weeks . The French then focused on the Austrians for the remainder of the war , the highlight of which became the protracted struggle for Mantua . The Austrians launched a series of offensives against the French to break the siege , but Napoleon defeated every relief effort , scoring notable victories at the battles of Castiglione , Bassano , Arcole , and Rivoli . The decisive French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy . At Rivoli , the Austrians lost up to 14,000 men while the French lost about 5,000 .
Nutrition is taught in schools in many countries . In England and Wales , the Personal and Social Education and Food Technology curricula include nutrition , stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition labels on packaging . In many schools , a Nutrition class will fall within the Family and Consumer Science or Health departments . In some American schools , students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes . Nutrition is offered at many schools , and , if it is not a class of its own , nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as : Life Skills , Independent Living , Single Survival , Freshmen Connection , Health etc . In many Nutrition classes , students learn about the food groups , the food pyramid , Daily Recommended Allowances , calories , vitamins , minerals , malnutrition , physical activity , healthful food choices , portion sizes , and how to live a healthy life .
The domestic dog ( Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris ) is a domesticated canid which has been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors , sensory capabilities , and physical attributes .
Because the Quran is spoken in classical Arabic , many of the later converts to Islam ( mostly non-Arabs ) did not always understand the Quranic Arabic , they did not catch allusions that were clear to early Muslims fluent in Arabic and they were concerned with reconciling apparent conflict of themes in the Quran . Commentators erudite in Arabic explained the allusions , and perhaps most importantly , explained which Quranic verses had been revealed early in Muhammad 's prophetic career , as being appropriate to the very earliest Muslim community , and which had been revealed later , canceling out or " abrogating " ( nāsikh ) the earlier text ( mansūkh ) . Other scholars , however , maintain that no abrogation has taken place in the Quran . The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has published a ten-volume Urdu commentary on the Quran , with the name Tafseer e Kabir .
After centuries of Danish , Swedish and German rule the native Estonians started to yearn for independence during the period of national awakening while being governed by the Russian Empire . Established on 24 February 1918 , the Republic of Estonia came into existence towards the end of World War I . During World War II , Estonia was then occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 , then Nazi Germany a year later and again in 1944 establishing the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic . In 1988 , during the Singing Revolution , the Estonian SSR issued the Estonian Sovereignty Declaration to defy against the illegal Soviet rule . Estonia then restored its independence during the 1991 coup by the Soviets on the night of 20 August 1991 .
Admissions are characterized as " most selective " by U.S. News & World Report . There were 35,099 applications for the undergraduate class of 2020 ( entering 2016 ) , and 3,751 ( 10.7 % ) were admitted , making Northwestern one of the most selective schools in the United States . For freshmen enrolling in the class of 2019 , the interquartile range ( middle 50 % ) on the SAT was 690–760 for critical reading and 710-800 for math , ACT composite scores for the middle 50 % ranged from 31–34 , and 91 % ranked in the top ten percent of their high school class .
By the time of John Seller 's Atlas Maritima of 1670 , " India Beyond the Ganges " had become " the East Indies " including China , Korea , southeast Asia and the islands of the Pacific in a map that was every bit as distorted as Ptolemy 's , despite the lapse of approximately 1500 years . That " east " in turn was only an English translation of Latin Oriens and Orientalis , " the land of the rising sun , " used since Roman times for " east . " The world map of Jodocus Hondius of 1590 labels all of Asia from the Caspian to the Pacific as India Orientalis , shortly to appear in translation as the East Indies .
During the administration of U.S. President Martin Van Buren , nearly 17,000 Cherokees—along with approximately 2,000 black slaves owned by Cherokees—were uprooted from their homes between 1838 and 1839 and were forced by the U.S. military to march from " emigration depots " in Eastern Tennessee ( such as Fort Cass ) toward the more distant Indian Territory west of Arkansas . During this relocation an estimated 4,000 Cherokees died along the way west . In the Cherokee language , the event is called Nunna daul Isunyi— " the Trail Where We Cried . " The Cherokees were not the only American Indians forced to emigrate as a result of the Indian removal efforts of the United States , and so the phrase " Trail of Tears " is sometimes used to refer to similar events endured by other American Indian peoples , especially among the " Five Civilized Tribes " . The phrase originated as a description of the earlier emigration of the Choctaw nation .
During encoding , 576 time-domain samples are taken and are transformed to 576 frequency-domain samples . [ clarification needed ] If there is a transient , 192 samples are taken instead of 576 . This is done to limit the temporal spread of quantization noise accompanying the transient . ( See psychoacoustics . )
The casualties were horrible , especially for the attacking Prussian forces . A grand total of 20,163 German troops were killed , wounded or missing in action during the August 18 battle . The French losses were 7,855 killed and wounded along with 4,420 prisoners of war ( half of them were wounded ) for a total of 12,275 . While most of the Prussians fell under the French Chassepot rifles , most French fell under the Prussian Krupp shells . In a breakdown of the casualties , Frossard 's II Corps of the Army of the Rhine suffered 621 casualties while inflicting 4,300 casualties on the Prussian First Army under Steinmetz before the Pointe du Jour . The Prussian Guards Infantry Divisions losses were even more staggering with 8,000 casualties out of 18,000 men . The Special Guards Jäger lost 19 officers , a surgeon and 431 men out of a total of 700 . The 2nd Guards Infantry Brigade lost 39 officers and 1,076 men . The 3rd Guards Infantry Brigade lost 36 officers and 1,060 men . On the French side , the units holding St. Privat lost more than half their number in the village .
Santa Bárbara became the launching place for expeditions into New Mexico by Spanish conquistadors like : Antonio de Espejo , Gaspar Castaño , Antonio Gutiérrez de Umaña , Francisco Leyba de Bonilla , and Vicente de Zaldívar . Several expeditions were led to find a shorter route from Santa Barbara to New Mexico . In April 1598 , Juan de Oñate finally found a short route from Santa Barbara to New Mexico which came to be called El Paso del Norte ( The Northern Pass ) . The discovery of El Paso Del Norte was important for the expansion of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro ( The Inner Land Royal Road ) to link Spanish settlements in New Mexico to Mexico City ; El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro facilitated transport of settlers and supplies to New Mexico .
The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals , the Soviet Union ( USSR ) and the United States ( US ) , for supremacy in spaceflight capability . It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II , enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel . The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security , and symbolic of ideological superiority . The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites , unmanned space probes of the Moon , Venus , and Mars , and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon . The competition began on August 2 , 1955 , when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year , by declaring they would also launch a satellite " in the near future " . The Soviet Union beat the US to this , with the October 4 , 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1 , and later beat the US to the first human in space , Yuri Gagarin , on April 12 , 1961 . The Space Race peaked with the July 20 , 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11 . The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions , and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations . A period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo–Soyuz Test Project , resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew .

The Slovenian countryside displays a variety of disguised groups and individual characters among which the most popular and characteristic is the Kurent ( plural : Kurenti ) , a monstrous and demon-like , but fluffy figure . The most significant festival is held in Ptuj ( see : Kurentovanje ) . Its special feature are the Kurents themselves , magical creatures from another world , who visit major events throughout the country , trying to banish the winter and announce spring 's arrival , fertility , and new life with noise and dancing . The origin of the Kurent is a mystery , and not much is known of the times , beliefs , or purposes connected with its first appearance . The origin of the name itself is obscure .
During the 20th century , the county became increasingly urbanised , particularly the southern part . To the existing county boroughs of Barrow-in-Furness , Blackburn , Bolton , Bootle , Burnley , Bury , Liverpool , Manchester , Oldham , Preston , Rochdale , Salford , St Helens and Wigan were added Blackpool ( 1904 ) , Southport ( 1905 ) , and Warrington ( 1900 ) . The county boroughs also had many boundary extensions . The borders around the Manchester area were particularly complicated , with narrow protrusions of the administrative county between the county boroughs – Lees urban district formed a detached part of the administrative county , between Oldham county borough and the West Riding of Yorkshire .

An estimated 20,000 Somalis emigrated to the U.S. state of Minnesota some ten years ago and the Twin Cities ( Minneapolis and Saint Paul ) now have the highest population of Somalis in North America . The city of Minneapolis hosts hundreds of Somali-owned and operated businesses offering a variety of products , including leather shoes , jewelry and other fashion items , halal meat , and hawala or money transfer services . Community-based video rental stores likewise carry the latest Somali films and music . The number of Somalis has especially surged in the Cedar-Riverside area of Minneapolis .
Beginning around 2005 , drug traffickers based in Latin America began to use Guinea-Bissau , along with several neighboring West African nations , as a transshipment point to Europe for cocaine . The nation was described by a United Nations official as being at risk for becoming a " narco-state " . The government and the military have done little to stop drug trafficking , which increased after the 2012 coup d'état .
Malaysia-based Yazhou Zhoukan conducted an interview with former researcher at the China Seismological Bureau Geng Qingguo ( 耿庆国 ) , in which Geng claimed that a confidential written report was sent to the State Seismological Bureau on April 30 , 2008 , warning about the possible occurrence of a significant earthquake in Ngawa Prefecture region of Sichuan around May 8 , with a range of 10 days before or after the quake . Geng , while acknowledging that earthquake prediction was broadly considered problematic by the scientific community , believed that " the bigger the earthquake , the easier it is to predict . " Geng had long attempted to establish a correlation between the occurrence of droughts and earthquakes ; Premier Zhou Enlai reportedly took an interest in Geng 's work . Geng 's drought-earthquake correlation theory was first released in 1972 , and said to have successfully predicted the 1975 Haicheng and 1976 Tangshan earthquakes . The same Yazhou Zhoukan article pointed out the inherent difficulties associated with predicting earthquakes . In response , an official with the Seismological Bureau stated that " earthquake prediction is widely acknowledged around the world to be difficult from a scientific standpoint . " The official also denied that the Seismological Bureau had received reports predicting the earthquake .
Mammals include the largest animals on the planet , the rorquals and other large whales , as well as some of the most intelligent , such as elephants , primates , including humans , and cetaceans . The basic body type is a four-legged land-borne animal , but some mammals are adapted for life at sea , in the air , in trees , or on two legs . The largest group of mammals , the placentals , have a placenta , which enables feeding the fetus during gestation . Mammals range in size from the 30–40 mm ( 1.2–1.6 in ) bumblebee bat to the 33-meter ( 108 ft ) blue whale .
It was granted its Royal Charter in 1837 under King William IV . Supplemental Charters of 1887 , 1909 and 1925 were replaced by a single Charter in 1971 , and there have been minor amendments since then .
In January 2015 , a customer named Ricardo Brown received a bill from Comcast with his name changed to " Asshole Brown " . Brown 's wife , Lisa , believed a Comcast employee changed the name in response to the Browns ' request to cancel their cable service , an incident in which she was refused a cancellation unless she paid a $ 60 fee and instead was routed to a retention specialist . Comcast refused to correct the name on their bill after bringing it to the attention of numerous customer service outlets for the company by explaining that Ricardo is the legal name of the customer , so the Browns turned to consumer advocate Christopher Elliott . Elliott posted the facts of the incident , along with a copy of the bill , on his blog . Shortly thereafter , Elliott contacted Comcast and Comcast offered the Browns an apology , a $ 60 refund , and a promise to track down and fire the responsible employee . The Browns instead requested a full refund for their negative experience and Comcast agreed to refund the family the last two years of service and provide the next two years of service at no charge . Comcast released a statement explaining : " We have spoken with our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name change . We have zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened . We are working with our customer to make this right and will take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again . "

During the Wisconsinan glaciation , the New York City region was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet over 1,000 feet in depth . The ice sheet scraped away large amounts of soil , leaving the bedrock that serves as the geologic foundation for much of New York City today . Later on , the ice sheet would help split apart what are now Long Island and Staten Island .
A minority view is that early seventeenth-century Baptists were influenced by ( but not directly connected to ) continental Anabaptists . According to this view , the General Baptists shared similarities with Dutch Waterlander Mennonites ( one of many Anabaptist groups ) including believer 's baptism only , religious liberty , separation of church and state , and Arminian views of salvation , predestination and original sin . Representative writers including A.C. Underwood and William R. Estep . Gourley wrote that among some contemporary Baptist scholars who emphasize the faith of the community over soul liberty , the Anabaptist influence theory is making a comeback .
Beginning in 2005 , the CBC has contributed production funds for the BBC Wales revival of Doctor Who , for which it received a special credit at the end of each episode . This arrangement continued until the end of fourth season , broadcast in 2008 . The CBC similarly contributed to the first season of the spin-off series , Torchwood . More recently , the network has also begun picking up Canadian rights to some Australian series , including the drama series Janet King and Love Child , and the comedy-drama series Please Like Me .
Endospores show no detectable metabolism and can survive extreme physical and chemical stresses , such as high levels of UV light , gamma radiation , detergents , disinfectants , heat , freezing , pressure , and desiccation . In this dormant state , these organisms may remain viable for millions of years , and endospores even allow bacteria to survive exposure to the vacuum and radiation in space . According to scientist Dr. Steinn Sigurdsson , " There are viable bacterial spores that have been found that are 40 million years old on Earth — and we know they 're very hardened to radiation . " Endospore-forming bacteria can also cause disease : for example , anthrax can be contracted by the inhalation of Bacillus anthracis endospores , and contamination of deep puncture wounds with Clostridium tetani endospores causes tetanus .
By the start of the 20th century , Germany and the United States challenged Britain 's economic lead . Subsequent military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the First World War , during which Britain relied heavily upon its empire . The conflict placed enormous strain on the military , financial and manpower resources of Britain . Although the British Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after World War I , Britain was no longer the world 's pre-eminent industrial or military power . In the Second World War , Britain 's colonies in South-East Asia were occupied by Imperial Japan . Despite the final victory of Britain and its allies , the damage to British prestige helped to accelerate the decline of the empire . India , Britain 's most valuable and populous possession , achieved independence as part of a larger decolonisation movement in which Britain granted independence to most territories of the Empire . The transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997 marked for many the end of the British Empire . Fourteen overseas territories remain under British sovereignty . After independence , many former British colonies joined the Commonwealth of Nations , a free association of independent states . The United Kingdom is now one of 16 Commonwealth nations , a grouping known informally as the Commonwealth realms , that share one monarch—Queen Elizabeth II .

According to Buddhist traditions a Buddha is a fully awakened being who has completely purified his mind of the three poisons of desire , aversion and ignorance . A Buddha is no longer bound by Samsara and has ended the suffering which unawakened people experience in life .
Hayek also wrote that the state can play a role in the economy , and specifically , in creating a " safety net " . He wrote , " There is no reason why , in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has , the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom ; that is : some minimum of food , shelter and clothing , sufficient to preserve health . Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision . "
In 1983 fighting between Palestinian refugees and Lebanese factions reignited that nation 's long-running civil war . A UN agreement brought an international force of peacekeepers to occupy Beirut and guarantee security . US Marines landed in August 1982 along with Italian and French forces . On October 23 , 1983 , a suicide bomber driving a truck filled with 6 tons of TNT crashed through a fence and destroyed the Marine barracks , killing 241 Marines ; seconds later , a second bomber leveled a French barracks , killing 58 . Subsequently the US Navy engaged in bombing of militia positions inside Lebanon . While US President Ronald Reagan was initially defiant , political pressure at home eventually forced the withdrawal of the Marines in February 1984 .
FBI Directors are appointed by the President of the United States . They must be confirmed by the United States Senate and serve a term of office of five years , with a maximum of ten years , if reappointed , unless they resign or are fired by the President before their term ends . J. Edgar Hoover , appointed by Calvin Coolidge in 1924 , was by far the longest-serving director , serving until his death in 1972 . In 1968 , Congress passed legislation as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act Pub.L . 90–351 , June 19 , 1968 , 82 Stat . 197 that specified a 10-year limit , a maximum of two 5-year terms , for future FBI Directors , as well as requiring Senate confirmation of appointees . As the incumbent , this legislation did not apply to Hoover , only to his successors . The current FBI Director is James B. Comey , who was appointed in 2013 by Barack Obama .
According to the Quran , God communicated with man and made his will known through signs and revelations . Prophets , or 'Messengers of God ' , received revelations and delivered them to humanity . The message has been identical and for all humankind . " Nothing is said to you that was not said to the messengers before you , that your lord has at his Command forgiveness as well as a most Grievous Penalty . " The revelation does not come directly from God to the prophets . Angels acting as God 's messengers deliver the divine revelation to them . This comes out in Quran 42:51 , in which it is stated : " It is not for any mortal that God should speak to them , except by revelation , or from behind a veil , or by sending a messenger to reveal by his permission whatsoever He will . "
Programming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run . Unlike natural languages , programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise . They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud . They are generally either translated into machine code by a compiler or an assembler before being run , or translated directly at run time by an interpreter . Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques .
Cladistics is a technique borrowed from biology , where it was originally named phylogenetic systematics by Willi Hennig . In biology , the technique is used to determine the evolutionary relationships between different species . In its application in textual criticism , the text of a number of different manuscripts is entered into a computer , which records all the differences between them . The manuscripts are then grouped according to their shared characteristics . The difference between cladistics and more traditional forms of statistical analysis is that , rather than simply arranging the manuscripts into rough groupings according to their overall similarity , cladistics assumes that they are part of a branching family tree and uses that assumption to derive relationships between them . This makes it more like an automated approach to stemmatics . However , where there is a difference , the computer does not attempt to decide which reading is closer to the original text , and so does not indicate which branch of the tree is the " root " —which manuscript tradition is closest to the original . Other types of evidence must be used for that purpose .
Some 97 percent of male BYU graduates and 32 percent of female graduates took a hiatus from their undergraduate studies at one point to serve as LDS missionaries . In October 2012 , the LDS Church announced at its general conference that young men could serve a mission after they turn 18 and have graduated from high school , rather than after age 19 under the old policy . Many young men would often attend a semester or two of higher education prior to beginning missionary service . This policy change will likely impact what has been the traditional incoming freshman class at BYU . Female students may now begin their missionary service anytime after turning 19 , rather than age 21 under the previous policy . For males , a full-time mission is two years in length , and for females it lasts 18 months .
The Districts of Germany ( Kreise ) are administrative districts , and every state except the city-states of Berlin , Hamburg , and Bremen consists of " rural districts " ( Landkreise ) , District-free Towns/Cities ( Kreisfreie Städte , in Baden-Württemberg also called " urban districts " , or Stadtkreise ) , cities that are districts in their own right , or local associations of a special kind ( Kommunalverbände besonderer Art ) , see below . The state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen consists of two urban districts , while Berlin and Hamburg are states and urban districts at the same time .
Bilateral treaties are concluded between two states or entities . It is possible , however , for a bilateral treaty to have more than two parties ; consider for instance the bilateral treaties between Switzerland and the European Union ( EU ) following the Swiss rejection of the European Economic Area agreement . Each of these treaties has seventeen parties . These however are still bilateral , not multilateral , treaties . The parties are divided into two groups , the Swiss ( " on the one part " ) and the EU and its member states ( " on the other part " ) . The treaty establishes rights and obligations between the Swiss and the EU and the member states severally—it does not establish any rights and obligations amongst the EU and its member states .

In some countries , such as Britain and Germany during the Second World War , the Soviet Union and NATO 's Allied Command Europe , ground based air defence and air defence aircraft have been under integrated command and control . However , while overall air defence may be for homeland defence including military facilities , forces in the field , wherever they are , invariably deploy their own air defence capability if there is an air threat . A surface-based air defence capability can also be deployed offensively to deny the use of airspace to an opponent .
Agricultural diversity can also be divided by whether it is ‘planned’ diversity or ‘associated’ diversity . This is a functional classification that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity . Planned diversity includes the crops which a farmer has encouraged , planted or raised ( e.g . : crops , covers , symbionts and livestock , among others ) , which can be contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the crops , uninvited ( e.g . : herbivores , weed species and pathogens , among others ) .
The concept of a gene continues to be refined as new phenomena are discovered . For example , regulatory regions of a gene can be far removed from its coding regions , and coding regions can be split into several exons . Some viruses store their genome in RNA instead of DNA and some gene products are functional non-coding RNAs . Therefore , a broad , modern working definition of a gene is any discrete locus of heritable , genomic sequence which affect an organism 's traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression .
According to the Namibia Labour Force Survey Report 2012 , conducted by the Namibia Statistics Agency , the country 's unemployment rate is 27.4 % . " Strict unemployment " ( people actively seeking a full-time job ) stood at 20.2 % in 2000 , 21.9 % in 2004 and spiraled to 29.4 % in 2008 . Under a broader definition ( including people that have given up searching for employment ) unemployment rose to 36.7 % in 2004 . This estimate considers people in the informal economy as employed . Labour and Social Welfare Minister Immanuel Ngatjizeko praised the 2008 study as " by far superior in scope and quality to any that has been available previously " , but its methodology has also received criticism .
The Taira and the Minamoto clashed again in 1180 , beginning the Gempei War , which ended in 1185 . Samurai fought at the naval battle of Dan-no-ura , at the Shimonoseki Strait which separates Honshu and Kyushu in 1185 . The victorious Minamoto no Yoritomo established the superiority of the samurai over the aristocracy . In 1190 he visited Kyoto and in 1192 became Sei'i-taishōgun , establishing the Kamakura Shogunate , or Kamakura Bakufu . Instead of ruling from Kyoto , he set up the Shogunate in Kamakura , near his base of power . " Bakufu " means " tent government " , taken from the encampments the soldiers would live in , in accordance with the Bakufu 's status as a military government .
Maas comments further that " A dictation revised by the author must be regarded as equivalent to an autograph manuscript " . The lack of autograph manuscripts applies to many cultures other than Greek and Roman . In such a situation , a key objective becomes the identification of the first exemplar before any split in the tradition . That exemplar is known as the archetype . " If we succeed in establishing the text of [ the archetype ] , the constitutio ( reconstruction of the original ) is considerably advanced .
John Dewey ( 1859–1952 ) modified James ' pragmatism to form a theory known as instrumentalism . The role of sense experience in Dewey 's theory is crucial , in that he saw experience as unified totality of things through which everything else is interrelated . Dewey 's basic thought , in accordance with empiricism was that reality is determined by past experience . Therefore , humans adapt their past experiences of things to perform experiments upon and test the pragmatic values of such experience . The value of such experience is measured experientially and scientifically , and the results of such tests generate ideas that serve as instruments for future experimentation , in physical sciences as in ethics . Thus , ideas in Dewey 's system retain their empiricist flavour in that they are only known a posteriori .
The end for the Laemmles came with a lavish version of Show Boat ( 1936 ) , a remake of its earlier 1929 part-talkie production , and produced as a high-quality , big-budget film rather than as a B-picture . The new film featured several stars from the Broadway stage version , which began production in late 1935 , and unlike the 1929 film was based on the Broadway musical rather than the novel . Carl , Jr. 's spending habits alarmed company stockholders . They would not allow production to start on Show Boat unless the Laemmles obtained a loan . Universal was forced to seek a $ 750,000 production loan from the Standard Capital Corporation , pledging the Laemmle family 's controlling interest in Universal as collateral . It was the first time Universal had borrowed money for a production in its 26-year history . The production went $ 300,000 over budget ; Standard called in the loan , cash-strapped Universal could not pay , Standard foreclosed and seized control of the studio on April 2 , 1936 .
The Berbers along the Barbary Coast ( modern day Libya ) sent pirates to capture merchant ships and hold the crews for ransom . The U.S. paid protection money until 1801 , when President Thomas Jefferson refused to pay and sent in the Navy to challenge the Barbary States , the First Barbary War followed . After the U.S.S . Philadelphia was captured in 1803 , Lieutenant Stephen Decatur led a raid which successfully burned the captured ship , preventing Tripoli from using or selling it . In 1805 , after William Eaton captured the city of Derna , Tripoli agreed to a peace treaty . The other Barbary states continued to raid U.S. shipping , until the Second Barbary War in 1815 ended the practice .
Universal owned the rights to the " Oswald the Lucky Rabbit " character , although Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks had created Oswald , and their films had enjoyed a successful theatrical run . After Charles Mintz had unsuccessfully demanded that Disney accept a lower fee for producing the property , Mintz produced the films with his own group of animators . Instead , Disney and Iwerks created Mickey Mouse who in 1928 stared in the first " sync " sound animated short , Steamboat Willie . This moment effectively launched Walt Disney Studios ' foothold , while Universal became a minor player in film animation . Universal subsequently severed its link to Mintz and formed its own in-house animation studio to produce Oswald cartoons headed by Walter Lantz .
Estimates for the percentage of the population that are bisexual vary widely , at least in part due to differing definitions of bisexuality . Some studies only consider a person bisexual if they are nearly equally attracted to both sexes , and others consider a person bisexual if they are at all attracted to the same sex ( for otherwise mostly heterosexual persons ) or to the opposite sex ( for otherwise mostly homosexual persons ) . A small percentage of people are not sexually attracted to anyone ( asexuality ) . A study in 2004 placed the prevalence of asexuality at 1 % .
At these higher altitudes , the plants tend to form isolated cushions . In the Alps , several species of flowering plants have been recorded above 4,000 m ( 13,120 ft ) , including Ranunculus glacialis , Androsace alpina and Saxifraga biflora . The Eritrichium nanum , commonly known as the King of the Alps , is the most elusive of the alpine flowers , growing on rocky ridges at 2,600 to 3,750 m ( 8,530 to 12,303 ft ) . Perhaps the best known of the alpine plants is the Edelweiss which grows in rocky areas and can be found at altitudes as low as 1,400 m ( 4,593 ft ) and as high as 3,400 m ( 11,155 ft ) . The plants that grow at the highest altitudes have adapted to conditions by specialization such as growing in rock screes that give protection from winds .
The Philippine–American War ( 1899–1902 ) was an armed conflict between a group of Filipino revolutionaries and the American forces following the ceding of the Philippines to the United States after the defeat of Spanish forces in the Battle of Manila . The Army sent in 100,000 soldiers ( mostly from the National Guard ) under General Elwell Otis . Defeated in the field and losing its capital in March 1899 , the poorly armed and poorly led rebels broke into armed bands . The insurgency collapsed in March 1901 when the leader Emilio Aguinaldo was captured by General Frederick Funston and his Macabebe allies . Casualties included 1,037 Americans killed in action and 3,340 who died from disease ; 20,000 rebels were killed .
Notably , a statute does not disappear automatically merely because it has been found unconstitutional ; it must be deleted by a subsequent statute . Many federal and state statutes have remained on the books for decades after they were ruled to be unconstitutional . However , under the principle of stare decisis , no sensible lower court will enforce an unconstitutional statute , and any court that does so will be reversed by the Supreme Court . Conversely , any court that refuses to enforce a constitutional statute ( where such constitutionality has been expressly established in prior cases ) will risk reversal by the Supreme Court .
Initially , the station 's range was officially a 40 kilometres radius of the Alexandra Palace transmitter—in practice , however , transmissions could be picked up a good deal further away , and on one occasion in 1938 were picked up by engineers at RCA in New York , who were experimenting with a British television set .
On 1 September , Germany invaded Poland from the west . Within the first few days of the invasion , Germany began conducting massacres of Polish and Jewish civilians and POWs . These executions took place in over 30 towns and villages in the first month of German occupation . The Luftwaffe also took part by strafing fleeing civilian refugees on roads and carrying out a bombing campaign . The Soviet Union assisted German air forces by allowing them to use signals broadcast by the Soviet radio station at Minsk allegedly " for urgent aeronautical experiments " .
Between April 1877 and February 1878 , she threatened five times to abdicate while pressuring Disraeli to act against Russia during the Russo-Turkish War , but her threats had no impact on the events or their conclusion with the Congress of Berlin . Disraeli 's expansionist foreign policy , which Victoria endorsed , led to conflicts such as the Anglo-Zulu War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War . " If we are to maintain our position as a first-rate Power " , she wrote , " we must ... be Prepared for attacks and wars , somewhere or other , CONTINUALLY . " Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign , protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers : " It is not in our custom to annexe countries " , she said , " unless we are obliged & forced to do so . " To Victoria 's dismay , Disraeli lost the 1880 general election , and Gladstone returned as prime minister . When Disraeli died the following year , she was blinded by " fast falling tears " , and erected a memorial tablet " placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend , Victoria R.I . "
Detroit remains one of the most racially segregated cities in the United States . From the 1940s to the 1970s a second wave of Blacks moved to Detroit to escape Jim Crow laws in the south and find jobs . However , they soon found themselves excluded from white areas of the city—through violence , laws , and economic discrimination ( e.g. , redlining ) . White residents attacked black homes : breaking windows , starting fires , and exploding bombs . The pattern of segregation was later magnified by white migration to the suburbs . One of the implications of racial segregation , which correlates with class segregation , may be overall worse health for some populations .
Clickjacking , also known as " UI redress attack or User Interface redress attack " , is a malicious technique in which an attacker tricks a user into clicking on a button or link on another webpage while the user intended to click on the top level page . This is done using multiple transparent or opaque layers . The attacker is basically " hijacking " the clicks meant for the top level page and routing them to some other irrelevant page , most likely owned by someone else . A similar technique can be used to hijack keystrokes . Carefully drafting a combination of stylesheets , iframes , buttons and text boxes , a user can be led into believing that they are typing the password or other information on some authentic webpage while it is being channeled into an invisible frame controlled by the attacker .
World War II holds a special place in the American psyche as the country 's greatest triumph , and the U.S. military personnel of World War II are frequently referred to as " the Greatest Generation . " Over 16 million served ( about 11 % of the population ) , and over 400,000 died during the war . The U.S. emerged as one of the two undisputed superpowers along with the Soviet Union , and unlike the Soviet Union , the U.S. homeland was virtually untouched by the ravages of war . During and following World War II , the United States and Britain developed an increasingly strong defense and intelligence relationship . Manifestations of this include extensive basing of U.S. forces in the UK , shared intelligence , shared military technology ( e.g . nuclear technology ) , and shared procurement .
The slowing sales growth has been attributed to the maturing PC market , which constituted 66 % of Dell 's sales , and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage , services and servers . Dell 's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs , but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company 's supply chain , and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell , weakening Dell 's traditional price differentiation . Throughout the entire PC industry , declines in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers ( a lucrative strategy of encouraging buyers to upgrade the processor or memory ) . As a result , the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before , which eroded profit margins . The laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the PC market , but Dell produced low-cost notebooks in China like other PC manufacturers which eliminated Dell 's manufacturing cost advantages , plus Dell 's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores . CNET has suggested that Dell was getting trapped in the increasing commoditization of high volume low margin computers , which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded .
The League of American Bicyclists gave Tucson a gold rating for bicycle friendliness in late April 2007 . Tucson hosts the largest perimeter cycling event in the United States . The ride called " El Tour de Tucson " happens in November on the Saturday before Thanksgiving . El Tour de Tucson produced and promoted by Perimeter Bicycling has as many as 10,000 participants from all over the world , annually . Tucson is one of only nine cities in the U.S. to receive a gold rating or higher for cycling friendliness from the League of American Bicyclists . The city is known for its winter cycling opportunities . Both road and mountain biking are popular in and around Tucson with trail areas including Starr Pass and Fantasy Island .
Labour improved its performance in 1987 , gaining 20 seats and so reducing the Conservative majority from 143 to 102 . They were now firmly re-established as the second political party in Britain as the Alliance had once again failed to make a breakthrough with seats . A merger of the SDP and Liberals formed the Liberal Democrats . Following the 1987 election , the National Executive Committee resumed disciplinary action against members of Militant , who remained in the party , leading to further expulsions of their activists and the two MPs who supported the group .
A political party is typically led by a party leader ( the most powerful member and spokesperson representing the party ) , a party secretary ( who maintains the daily work and records of party meetings ) , party treasurer ( who is responsible for membership dues ) and party chair ( who forms strategies for recruiting and retaining party members , and also chairs party meetings ) . Most of the above positions are also members of the party executive , the leading organization which sets policy for the entire party at the national level . The structure is far more decentralized in the United States because of the separation of powers , federalism and the multiplicity of economic interests and religious sects . Even state parties are decentralized as county and other local committees are largely independent of state central committees . The national party leader in the U.S. will be the president , if the party holds that office , or a prominent member of Congress in opposition ( although a big-state governor may aspire to that role ) . Officially , each party has a chairman for its national committee who is a prominent spokesman , organizer and fund-raiser , but without the status of prominent elected office holders .
In March 1912 , in Chihuahua , Gen. Pascual Orozco revolted . Immediately President Francisco Madero commanded Gen. Victoriano Huerta of the Federal Army , to put down the Orozco revolt . The governor of Chihuahua mobilized the state militia led by Colonel Pancho Villa to supplement General Huerta . By June , Villa notified Huerta that the Orozco revolt had been put down and that the militia would consider themselves no longer under Huerta 's command and would depart . Huerta became furious and ordered that Villa be executed . Raúl Madero , Madero 's brother , intervened to save Villa 's life . Jailed in Mexico City , Villa fled to the United States . Madero 's time as leader was short-lived , ended by a coup d'état in 1913 led by Gen. Victoriano Huerta ; Orozco sided with Huerta , and Huerta made him one of his generals .
Geology did not undergo systematic restructuring during the Scientific Revolution , but individual theorists made important contributions . Robert Hooke , for example , formulated a theory of earthquakes , and Nicholas Steno developed the theory of superposition and argued that fossils were the remains of once-living creatures . Beginning with Thomas Burnet 's Sacred Theory of the Earth in 1681 , natural philosophers began to explore the idea that the Earth had changed over time . Burnet and his contemporaries interpreted Earth 's past in terms of events described in the Bible , but their work laid the intellectual foundations for secular interpretations of Earth history .
Buses now provide the majority of local public transport . The main bus operators are First Southampton and Bluestar . Other operators include Brijan Tours , Stagecoach and Xelabus . The other large service provider is the Uni-link bus service ( running from early in the morning to midnight ) , which was commissioned by the University of Southampton to provide transport from the university to the town . Previously run by Enterprise , it is now run by Bluestar . Free buses are provided by City-link ' . The City-link runs from the Red Funnel ferry terminal at Town Quay to Central station via WestQuay and is operated by Bluestar . There is also a door-to-door minibus service called Southampton Dial a Ride , for residents who can not access public transport . This is funded by the council and operated by SCA Support Services .
The Roman Catholic Church canon law also includes the main five rites ( groups ) of churches which are in full union with the Roman Catholic Church and the Supreme Pontiff :
Established bands made something of a comeback in the mid-1980s . After an 8-year separation , Deep Purple returned with the classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers ( 1984 ) , which reached number five in the UK , hit the top five in five other countries , and was a platinum-seller in the US . After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album , Fair Warning , Van Halen rebounded with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982 , then reached their commercial pinnacle with 1984 . It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and provided the track " Jump " , which reached number one on the singles chart and remained there for several weeks . Heart , after floundering during the first half of the decade , made a comeback with their eponymous ninth studio album which hit number one and contained four Top 10 singles including their first number one hit . The new medium of video channels was used with considerable success by bands formed in previous decades . Among the first were ZZ Top , who mixed hard blues rock with new wave music to produce a series of highly successful singles , beginning with " Gim me All Your Lovin ' " ( 1983 ) , which helped their albums Eliminator ( 1983 ) and Afterburner ( 1985 ) achieve diamond and multi-platinum status respectively . Others found renewed success in the singles charts with power ballads , including REO Speedwagon with " Keep on Loving You " ( 1980 ) and " Ca n't Fight This Feeling " ( 1984 ) , Journey with " Do n't Stop Believin ' " ( 1981 ) and " Open Arms " ( 1982 ) , Foreigner 's " I Want to Know What Love Is " , Scorpions ' " Still Loving You " ( both from 1984 ) , Heart’s " What About Love " ( 1985 ) and " These Dreams " ( 1986 ) , and Boston 's " Amanda " ( 1986 ) .
The city council of the city of Bern decided against having twinned cities except for a temporary ( during the UEFA Euro 2008 ) cooperation with the Austrian city Salzburg
The boreholes on Funafuti , at the site now called Darwin 's Drill , are the result of drilling conducted by the Royal Society of London for the purpose of investigating the formation of coral reefs to determine whether traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the coral of Pacific atolls . This investigation followed the work on The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs conducted by Charles Darwin in the Pacific . Drilling occurred in 1896 , 1897 and 1898 . Professor Edgeworth David of the University of Sydney was a member of the 1896 " Funafuti Coral Reef Boring Expedition of the Royal Society " , under Professor William Sollas and lead the expedition in 1897 . Photographers on these trips recorded people , communities , and scenes at Funafuti .
Valencia was founded as a Roman colony in 138 BC . The city is situated on the banks of the Turia , on the east coast of the Iberian Peninsula , fronting the Gulf of Valencia on the Mediterranean Sea . Its historic centre is one of the largest in Spain , with approximately 169 hectares ; this heritage of ancient monuments , views and cultural attractions makes Valencia one of the country 's most popular tourist destinations . Major monuments include Valencia Cathedral , the Torres de Serrans , the Torres de Quart , the Llotja de la Seda ( declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1996 ) , and the Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències ( City of Arts and Sciences ) , an entertainment-based cultural and architectural complex designed by Santiago Calatrava and Félix Candela . The Museu de Belles Arts de València houses a large collection of paintings from the 14th to the 18th centuries , including works by Velázquez , El Greco , and Goya , as well as an important series of engravings by Piranesi . The Institut Valencià d'Art Modern ( Valencian Institute of Modern Art ) houses both permanent collections and temporary exhibitions of contemporary art and photography .
Differences in pain perception and tolerance thresholds are associated with , among other factors , ethnicity , genetics , and sex . People of Mediterranean origin report as painful some radiant heat intensities that northern Europeans describe as nonpainful . And Italian women tolerate less intense electric shock than Jewish or Native American women . Some individuals in all cultures have significantly higher than normal pain perception and tolerance thresholds . For instance , patients who experience painless heart attacks have higher pain thresholds for electric shock , muscle cramp and heat .
Thousands of fonts exist on the market , but fewer than a dozen fonts—sometimes described as " pan-Unicode " fonts—attempt to support the majority of Unicode 's character repertoire . Instead , Unicode-based fonts typically focus on supporting only basic ASCII and particular scripts or sets of characters or symbols . Several reasons justify this approach : applications and documents rarely need to render characters from more than one or two writing systems ; fonts tend to demand resources in computing environments ; and operating systems and applications show increasing intelligence in regard to obtaining glyph information from separate font files as needed , i.e. , font substitution . Furthermore , designing a consistent set of rendering instructions for tens of thousands of glyphs constitutes a monumental task ; such a venture passes the point of diminishing returns for most typefaces .
The Portuguese explorer Diogo Cão reached the mouth of the Congo in 1484 . Commercial relationships quickly grew between the inland Bantu kingdoms and European merchants who traded various commodities , manufactured goods , and people captured from the hinterlands . After centuries as a major hub for transatlantic trade , direct European colonization of the Congo river delta began in the late 19th century , subsequently eroding the power of the Bantu societies in the region .
There are several reasons an otherwise valid and agreed upon treaty may be rejected as a binding international agreement , most of which involve problems created at the formation of the treaty . [ citation needed ] For example , the serial Japan-Korea treaties of 1905 , 1907 and 1910 were protested ; and they were confirmed as " already null and void " in the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea .
Another milestone in the early development of Baptist doctrine was in 1638 with John Spilsbury , a Calvinistic minister who helped to promote the strict practice of believer 's baptism by immersion . According to Tom Nettles , professor of historical theology at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary , " Spilsbury 's cogent arguments for a gathered , disciplined congregation of believers baptized by immersion as constituting the New Testament church gave expression to and built on insights that had emerged within separatism , advanced in the life of John Smyth and the suffering congregation of Thomas Helwys , and matured in Particular Baptists . "
Besides the bit rate of an encoded piece of audio , the quality of MP3 files also depends on the quality of the encoder itself , and the difficulty of the signal being encoded . As the MP3 standard allows quite a bit of freedom with encoding algorithms , different encoders may feature quite different quality , even with identical bit rates . As an example , in a public listening test featuring two different MP3 encoders at about 128 kbit/s , one scored 3.66 on a 1–5 scale , while the other scored only 2.22 .
Detroit 's protracted decline has resulted in severe urban decay and thousands of empty buildings around the city . Some parts of Detroit are so sparsely populated that the city has difficulty providing municipal services . The city has considered various solutions , such as demolishing abandoned homes and buildings ; removing street lighting from large portions of the city ; and encouraging the small population in certain areas to move to more populated locations . While some have estimated 20,000 stray dogs roam the city , studies have shown the true number to be around 1,000-3,000 . Roughly half of the owners of Detroit 's 305,000 properties failed to pay their 2011 tax bills , resulting in about $ 246 million in taxes and fees going uncollected , nearly half of which was due to Detroit ; the rest of the money would have been earmarked for Wayne County , Detroit Public Schools , and the library system .
A knot is a particular type of imperfection in a piece of wood ; it will affect the technical properties of the wood , usually reducing the local strength and increasing the tendency for splitting along the wood grain , but may be exploited for visual effect . In a longitudinally sawn plank , a knot will appear as a roughly circular " solid " ( usually darker ) piece of wood around which the grain of the rest of the wood " flows " ( parts and rejoins ) . Within a knot , the direction of the wood ( grain direction ) is up to 90 degrees different from the grain direction of the regular wood .
In infrared photography , infrared filters are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum . Digital cameras often use infrared blockers . Cheaper digital cameras and camera phones have less effective filters and can " see " intense near-infrared , appearing as a bright purple-white color . This is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near IR-bright areas ( such as near a lamp ) , where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image . There is also a technique called 'T-ray ' imaging , which is imaging using far-infrared or terahertz radiation . Lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques . Recently T-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy .
The Chicago Transit Authority 's elevated train running through Evanston is called the Purple Line , taking its name from Northwestern 's school color . The Foster and Davis stations are within walking distance of the southern end of the campus , while the Noyes station is close to the northern end of the campus . The Central station is close to Ryan Field , Northwestern 's football stadium . The Evanston Davis Street Metra station serves the Northwestern campus in downtown Evanston and the Evanston Central Street Metra station is near Ryan Field . Pace Suburban Bus Service and the CTA have several bus routes that run through or near the Evanston campus .
A major battleground , Burma was devastated during World War II . By March 1942 , within months after they entered the war , Japanese troops had advanced on Rangoon and the British administration had collapsed . A Burmese Executive Administration headed by Ba Maw was established by the Japanese in August 1942 . Wingate 's British Chindits were formed into long-range penetration groups trained to operate deep behind Japanese lines . A similar American unit , Merrill 's Marauders , followed the Chindits into the Burmese jungle in 1943 . Beginning in late 1944 , allied troops launched a series of offensives that led to the end of Japanese rule in July 1945 . The battles were intense with much of Burma laid waste by the fighting . Overall , the Japanese lost some 150,000 men in Burma . Only 1,700 prisoners were taken .
The Crimean War was a military conflict fought between October 1853 – March 1856 in which Russia lost to an alliance of France , the United Kingdom , the Ottoman Empire , and Sardinia . The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land , which was controlled by the Ottoman Empire . The French promoted the rights of Catholics , while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Christians . The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of the United Kingdom and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense . It has widely been noted that the causes , in one case involving an argument over a key , have never revealed a " greater confusion of purpose " , yet led to a war noted for its " notoriously incompetent international butchery . "
Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1970s , the bureau investigated cases of espionage against the United States and its allies . Eight Nazi agents who had planned sabotage operations against American targets were arrested , and six were executed ( Ex parte Quirin ) under their sentences . Also during this time , a joint US/UK code-breaking effort ( the Venona project ) —with which the FBI was heavily involved—broke Soviet diplomatic and intelligence communications codes , allowing the US and British governments to read Soviet communications . This effort confirmed the existence of Americans working in the United States for Soviet intelligence . Hoover was administering this project but failed to notify the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) until 1952 . Another notable case is the arrest of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in 1957 . The discovery of Soviet spies operating in the US allowed Hoover to pursue his longstanding obsession with the threat he perceived from the American Left , ranging from Communist Party of the United States of America ( CPUSA ) union organizers to American liberals .
Prior to 1948 , approximately 800,000 Jews were living in lands which now make up the Arab world ( excluding Israel ) . Of these , just under two-thirds lived in the French-controlled Maghreb region , 15–20 % in the Kingdom of Iraq , approximately 10 % in the Kingdom of Egypt and approximately 7 % in the Kingdom of Yemen . A further 200,000 lived in Pahlavi Iran and the Republic of Turkey . Today , around 26,000 Jews live in Arab countries and around 30,000 in Iran and Turkey . A small-scale exodus had begun in many countries in the early decades of the 20th century , although the only substantial aliyah came from Yemen and Syria . The exodus from Arab and Muslim countries took place primarily from 1948 . The first large-scale exoduses took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s , primarily in Iraq , Yemen and Libya , with up to 90 % of these communities leaving within a few years . The peak of the exodus from Egypt occurred in 1956 . The exodus in the Maghreb countries peaked in the 1960s . Lebanon was the only Arab country to see a temporary increase in its Jewish population during this period , due to an influx of refugees from other Arab countries , although by the mid-1970s the Jewish community of Lebanon had also dwindled . In the aftermath of the exodus wave from Arab states , an additional migration of Iranian Jews peaked in the 1980s when around 80 % of Iranian Jews left the country . [ citation needed ]
Much of the medieval period was a time of power struggles between competing dynasties such as the House of Savoy , the Visconti in northern Italy and the House of Habsburg in Austria and Slovenia . In 1291 to protect themselves from incursions by the Habsburgs , four cantons in the middle of Switzerland drew up a charter that is considered to be a declaration of independence from neighboring kingdoms . After a series of battles fought in the 13th , 14th and 15th centuries , more cantons joined the confederacy and by the 16th century Switzerland was well-established as a separate state .
Nociceptive pain may also be divided into " visceral " , " deep somatic " and " superficial somatic " pain . Visceral structures are highly sensitive to stretch , ischemia and inflammation , but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain in other structures , such as burning and cutting . Visceral pain is diffuse , difficult to locate and often referred to a distant , usually superficial , structure . It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting and may be described as sickening , deep , squeezing , and dull . Deep somatic pain is initiated by stimulation of nociceptors in ligaments , tendons , bones , blood vessels , fasciae and muscles , and is dull , aching , poorly-localized pain . Examples include sprains and broken bones . Superficial pain is initiated by activation of nociceptors in the skin or other superficial tissue , and is sharp , well-defined and clearly located . Examples of injuries that produce superficial somatic pain include minor wounds and minor ( first degree ) burns .
The " formal " interpretation is more widespread than the " substantive " interpretation . Formalists hold that the law must be prospective , well-known , and have characteristics of generality , equality , and certainty . Other than that , the formal view contains no requirements as to the content of the law . This formal approach allows laws that protect democracy and individual rights , but recognizes the existence of " rule of law " in countries that do not necessarily have such laws protecting democracy or individual rights .
At the dawn of the Grand Lodge era , during the 1720s , James Anderson composed the first printed constitutions for Freemasons , the basis for most subsequent constitutions , which specifically excluded women from Freemasonry . As Freemasonry spread , continental masons began to include their ladies in Lodges of Adoption , which worked three degrees with the same names as the men 's but different content . The French officially abandoned the experiment in the early 19th century . Later organisations with a similar aim emerged in the United States , but distinguished the names of the degrees from those of male masonry .
Alternative proposals for the etymology of *Slověninъ propounded by some scholars have much less support . Lozinski argues that the word *slava once had the meaning of worshipper , in this context meaning " practicer of a common Slavic religion , " and from that evolved into an ethnonym . S.B . Bernstein speculates that it derives from a reconstructed Proto-Indo-European * ( s ) lawos , cognate to Ancient Greek λαός laós " population , people , " which itself has no commonly accepted etymology . Meanwhile , others have pointed out that the suffix -enin indicates a man from a certain place , which in this case should be a place called Slova or Slava , possibly a river name . The Old East Slavic Slavuta for the Dnieper River was argued by Henrich Bartek ( 1907–1986 ) to be derived from slova and also the origin of Slovene .
Windows 8 was released to a mixed critical reception . Although reaction towards its performance improvements , security enhancements , and improved support for touchscreen devices was positive , the new user interface of the operating system was widely criticized for being potentially confusing and difficult to learn ( especially when used with a keyboard and mouse instead of a touchscreen ) . Despite these shortcomings , 60 million Windows 8 licenses have been sold through January 2013 , a number which included both upgrades and sales to OEMs for new PCs .
By the Middle Ages , large numbers of Jews lived in the Holy Roman Empire and had assimilated into German culture , including many Jews who had previously assimilated into French culture and had spoken a mixed Judeo-French language . Upon assimilating into German culture , the Jewish German peoples incorporated major parts of the German language and elements of other European languages into a mixed language known as Yiddish . However tolerance and assimilation of Jews in German society suddenly ended during the Crusades with many Jews being forcefully expelled from Germany and Western Yiddish disappeared as a language in Germany over the centuries , with German Jewish people fully adopting the German language .
Portugal has developed a specific culture while being influenced by various civilizations that have crossed the Mediterranean and the European continent , or were introduced when it played an active role during the Age of Discovery . In the 1990s and 2000s ( decade ) , Portugal modernized its public cultural facilities , in addition to the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation established in 1956 in Lisbon . These include the Belém Cultural Centre in Lisbon , Serralves Foundation and the Casa da Música , both in Porto , as well as new public cultural facilities like municipal libraries and concert halls that were built or renovated in many municipalities across the country . Portugal is home to fifteen UNESCO World Heritage Sites , ranking it 8th in Europe and 17th in the world .
Seasonal rankings ( based on average total viewers per episode ) of American Idol . It holds the distinction of having the longest winning streak in the Nielsen annual television ratings ; it became the highest-rated of all television programs in the United States overall for an unprecedented seven consecutive years , or eight consecutive ( and total ) years when either its performance or result show was ranked number one overall .
Spielberg was scheduled to shoot a $ 200 million adaptation of Daniel H. Wilson 's novel Robopocalypse , adapted for the screen by Drew Goddard . The film would follow a global human war against a robot uprising about 15–20 years in the future . Like Lincoln , it was to be released by Disney in the United States and Fox overseas . It was set for release on April 25 , 2014 , with Anne Hathaway and Chris Hemsworth set to star , but Spielberg postponed production indefinitely in January 2013 , just before it had been set to begin .
By May 15 , Premier Wen Jiabao ordered the deployment of an additional 90 helicopters , of which 60 were to be provided by the PLAAF , and 30 were to be provided by the civil aviation industry , bringing the total of number of aircraft deployed in relief operations by the air force , army , and civil aviation to over 150 , resulting in the largest non-combat airlifting operation in People 's Liberation Army history .
In England , one of the few licensed venues The Eclipse attracted people from up and down the country as it was open until the early hours . The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 was a government attempt to ban large rave dance events featuring music with " repetitive beats " . There were a number of abortive " Kill the Bill " demonstrations . The Spiral Tribe at Castle Morten was probably the nail in the coffin for illegal raves , and forced through the bill , which became law , in November 1994 . The music continued to grow and change , as typified by Leftfield with " Release the Pressure " , which introduced dub and reggae into the house sound , although Leftfield had prior releases , such as " Not Forgotten " released in 1990 on Sheffield 's Outer Rhythm records .
ADSL-broadband service is provided with maximum speeds of up to 1536 KBit/s downstream and 512 KBit/s upstream offered on contract levels from lite £16 per month to gold+ at £190 per month . There are a few public WiFi hotspots in Jamestown , which are also being operated by SURE ( formerly Cable & Wireless ) .
Quotient groups and subgroups together form a way of describing every group by its presentation : any group is the quotient of the free group over the generators of the group , quotiented by the subgroup of relations . The dihedral group D4 , for example , can be generated by two elements r and f ( for example , r = r1 , the right rotation and f = fv the vertical ( or any other ) reflection ) , which means that every symmetry of the square is a finite composition of these two symmetries or their inverses . Together with the relations
Cancer is now common in developing countries . According to a study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer , " In the developing world , cancers of the liver , stomach and esophagus were more common , often linked to consumption of carcinogenic preserved foods , such as smoked or salted food , and parasitic infections that attack organs . " Lung cancer rates are rising rapidly in poorer nations because of increased use of tobacco . Developed countries " tended to have cancers linked to affluence or a 'Western lifestyle ' — cancers of the colon , rectum , breast and prostate — that can be caused by obesity , lack of exercise , diet and age . "
Imperial submitted a total of 1,257 staff across 14 units of assessment to the 2014 Research Excellence Framework ( REF ) assessment . In the REF results 46 % of Imperial 's submitted research was classified as 4* , 44 % as 3* , 9 % as 2* and 1 % as 1* , giving an overall GPA of 3.36 . In rankings produced by Times Higher Education based upon the REF results Imperial was ranked 2nd overall for GPA and 8th for " research power " ( compared to 6th and 7th respectively in the equivalent rankings for the RAE 2008 ) .
On 17 March 1883 , she fell down some stairs at Windsor , which left her lame until July ; she never fully recovered and was plagued with rheumatism thereafter . Brown died 10 days after her accident , and to the consternation of her private secretary , Sir Henry Ponsonby , Victoria began work on a eulogistic biography of Brown . Ponsonby and Randall Davidson , Dean of Windsor , who had both seen early drafts , advised Victoria against publication , on the grounds that it would stoke the rumours of a love affair . The manuscript was destroyed . In early 1884 , Victoria did publish More Leaves from a Journal of a Life in the Highlands , a sequel to her earlier book , which she dedicated to her " devoted personal attendant and faithful friend John Brown " . On the day after the first anniversary of Brown 's death , Victoria was informed by telegram that her youngest son , Leopold , had died in Cannes . He was " the dearest of my dear sons " , she lamented . The following month , Victoria 's youngest child , Beatrice , met and fell in love with Prince Henry of Battenberg at the wedding of Victoria 's granddaughter Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine to Henry 's brother Prince Louis of Battenberg . Beatrice and Henry planned to marry , but Victoria opposed the match at first , wishing to keep Beatrice at home to act as her companion . After a year , she was won around to the marriage by Henry and Beatrice 's promise to remain living with and attending her .
However , Mathews ' frustration with Whitehead 's books did not negatively affect his interest . In fact , there were numerous philosophers and theologians at Chicago 's Divinity School that perceived the importance of what Whitehead was doing without fully grasping all of the details and implications . In 1927 they invited one of America 's only Whitehead experts – Henry Nelson Wieman – to Chicago to give a lecture explaining Whitehead 's thought . Wieman 's lecture was so brilliant that he was promptly hired to the faculty and taught there for twenty years , and for at least thirty years afterward Chicago 's Divinity School was closely associated with Whitehead 's thought .
The cardinal deacons are the lowest-ranking cardinals . Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are either officials of the Roman Curia or priests elevated after their 80th birthday . Bishops with diocesan responsibilities , however , are created cardinal priests .
human activities are more likely to affect the habitat in areas of permanent water ( oases ) or where water comes close to the surface . Here , the local pressure on natural resources can be intense . The remaining populations of large mammals have been greatly reduced by hunting for food and recreation . In recent years development projects have started in the deserts of Algeria and Tunisia using irrigated water pumped from underground aquifers . These schemes often lead to soil degradation and salinization .
The oldest evidence of burial customs in the Horn of Africa comes from cemeteries in Somalia dating back to 4th millennium BC . The stone implements from the Jalelo site in northern Somalia are said to be the most important link in evidence of the universality in palaeolithic times between the East and the West .
Anthropologists maintain that hunter/gatherers do n't have permanent leaders ; instead , the person taking the initiative at any one time depends on the task being performed . In addition to social and economic equality in hunter-gatherer societies , there is often , though not always , sexual parity as well . Hunter-gatherers are often grouped together based on kinship and band ( or tribe ) membership . Postmarital residence among hunter-gatherers tends to be matrilocal , at least initially . Young mothers can enjoy childcare support from their own mothers , who continue living nearby in the same camp . The systems of kinship and descent among human hunter-gatherers were relatively flexible , although there is evidence that early human kinship in general tended to be matrilineal .
The creation of the public sphere has been associated with two long-term historical trends : the rise of the modern nation state and the rise of capitalism . The modern nation state , in its consolidation of public power , created by counterpoint a private realm of society independent of the state , which allowed for the public sphere . Capitalism also increased society 's autonomy and self-awareness , and an increasing need for the exchange of information . As the nascent public sphere expanded , it embraced a large variety of institutions ; the most commonly cited were coffee houses and cafés , salons and the literary public sphere , figuratively localized in the Republic of Letters . In France , the creation of the public sphere was helped by the aristocracy 's move from the King 's palace at Versailles to Paris in about 1720 , since their rich spending stimulated the trade in luxuries and artistic creations , especially fine paintings .
The creation of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 was through the unification of the western states ( which were previously under American , British , and French administration ) created in the aftermath of World War II . Initially , in 1949 , the states of the Federal Republic were Baden , Bavaria ( in German : Bayern ) , Bremen , Hamburg , Hesse ( Hessen ) , Lower Saxony ( Niedersachsen ) , North Rhine Westphalia ( Nordrhein-Westfalen ) , Rhineland-Palatinate ( Rheinland-Pfalz ) , Schleswig-Holstein , Württemberg-Baden , and Württemberg-Hohenzollern . West Berlin , while officially not part of the Federal Republic , was largely integrated and considered as a de facto state .
A thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives , including psychology , biology , history , sociology , education , and anthropology . Within all of these perspectives , adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood , whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles . It is a period of multiple transitions involving education , training , employment and unemployment , as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another .
Interspersed repeats mainly come from transposable elements ( TEs ) , but they also include some protein coding gene families and pseudogenes . Transposable elements are able to integrate into the genome at another site within the cell . It is believed that TEs are an important driving force on genome evolution of higher eukaryotes . TEs can be classified into two categories , Class 1 ( retrotransposons ) and Class 2 ( DNA transposons ) .
The first mention of the name " Rajasthan " appears in James Tod 's 1829 publication Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han or the Central and Western Rajpoot States of India , while the earliest known record of " Rajputana " as a name for the region is in George Thomas 's 1800 memoir Military Memories . John Keay , in his book India : A History , stated that " Rajputana " was coined by the British in 1829 , John Briggs , translating Ferishta 's history of early Islamic India , used the phrase " Rajpoot ( Rajput ) princes " rather than " Indian princes " .
On 15 July 1974 , the Greek military junta under Dimitrios Ioannides carried out a coup d'état in Cyprus , to unite the island with Greece . The coup ousted president Makarios III and replaced him with pro-enosis nationalist Nikos Sampson . In response to the coup , five days later , on 20 July 1974 , the Turkish army invaded the island , citing a right to intervene to restore the constitutional order from the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee . This justification has been rejected by the United Nations and the international community .
Since 2009 , the Tucson Festival of Books has been held annually over a two-day period in March at the University of Arizona . By 2010 it had become the fourth largest book festival in the United States , with 450 authors and 80,000 attendees . In addition to readings and lectures , it features a science fair , varied entertainment , food , and exhibitors ranging from local retailers and publishers to regional and national nonprofit organizations . In 2011 , the Festival began presenting a Founder 's Award ; recipients include Elmore Leonard and R.L . Stine .
On the eve of America 's entry into World War II , CAA began to extend its ATC responsibilities to takeoff and landing operations at airports . This expanded role eventually became permanent after the war . The application of radar to ATC helped controllers in their drive to keep abreast of the postwar boom in commercial air transportation . In 1946 , meanwhile , Congress gave CAA the added task of administering the federal-aid airport program , the first peacetime program of financial assistance aimed exclusively at promoting development of the nation 's civil airports .
Gorbachev again refused to make any changes to the status of Nagorno Karabakh , which remained part of Azerbaijan . Instead he sacked both Republics ' Communist Party Leaders : On May 21 , 1988 , Karen Demirchian was replaced by Suren Harutyunyan as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia . However , Harutyunyan quickly decided to run before the nationalist wind and on May 28 , allowed Armenians to unfurl the red-blue-gold First Armenian Republic flag for the first time in almost 70 years . On June 15 , 1988 , the Armenian Supreme Soviet adopted a resolution formally approving the idea of Nagorno Karabakh joining Armenia . Armenia , formerly one of the most loyal Republics , had suddenly turned into the leading rebel republic . On July 5 , 1988 , when a contingent of troops was sent in to remove demonstrators by force from Yerevan 's Zvartnots International Airport , shots were fired and one student protester was killed . In September , further large demonstrations in Yerevan led to the deployment of armored vehicles . In the autumn of 1988 almost all the 200,000 Azerbaijani minority in Armenia was expelled by Armenian Nationalists , with over 100 killed in the process – this , after the Sumgait pogrom earlier that year carried out by Azerbaijanis against ethnic Armenians and subsequent expulsion of all Armenians from Azerbaijan . On November 25 , 1988 , a military commandant took control of Yerevan as the Soviet government moved to prevent further ethnic violence .
According to a tradition first reported by Sulcard in about 1080 , a church was founded at the site ( then known as Thorn Ey ( Thorn Island ) ) in the 7th century , at the time of Mellitus , a Bishop of London . Construction of the present church began in 1245 , on the orders of King Henry III .
Writing in 1998 Kurt Jonassohn and Karin Björnson stated that the CPPCG was a legal instrument resulting from a diplomatic compromise . As such the wording of the treaty is not intended to be a definition suitable as a research tool , and although it is used for this purpose , as it has an international legal credibility that others lack , other definitions have also been postulated . Jonassohn and Björnson go on to say that none of these alternative definitions have gained widespread support for various reasons .
Oklahoma holds eleven public regional universities , including Northeastern State University , the second-oldest institution of higher education west of the Mississippi River , also containing the only College of Optometry in Oklahoma and the largest enrollment of Native American students in the nation by percentage and amount . Langston University is Oklahoma 's only historically black college . Six of the state 's universities were placed in the Princeton Review 's list of best 122 regional colleges in 2007 , and three made the list of top colleges for best value . The state has 55 post-secondary technical institutions operated by Oklahoma 's CareerTech program for training in specific fields of industry or trade .
At Buya in Eritrea , one of the oldest hominids representing a possible link between Homo erectus and an archaic Homo sapiens was found by Italian scientists . Dated to over 1 million years old , it is the oldest skeletal find of its kind and provides a link between hominids and the earliest anatomically modern humans . It is believed that the section of the Danakil Depression in Eritrea was also a major player in terms of human evolution , and may contain other traces of evolution from Homo erectus hominids to anatomically modern humans .
Other cities with a concentration of secular Gothic include Bruges and Siena . Most surviving small secular buildings are relatively plain and straightforward ; most windows are flat-topped with mullions , with pointed arches and vaulted ceilings often only found at a few focal points . The country-houses of the nobility were slow to abandon the appearance of being a castle , even in parts of Europe , like England , where defence had ceased to be a real concern . The living and working parts of many monastic buildings survive , for example at Mont Saint-Michel .
The black-body problem was revisited in 1905 , when Rayleigh and Jeans ( on the one hand ) and Einstein ( on the other hand ) independently proved that classical electromagnetism could never account for the observed spectrum . These proofs are commonly known as the " ultraviolet catastrophe " , a name coined by Paul Ehrenfest in 1911 . They contributed greatly ( along with Einstein 's work on the photoelectric effect ) to convincing physicists that Planck 's postulate of quantized energy levels was more than a mere mathematical formalism . The very first Solvay Conference in 1911 was devoted to " the theory of radiation and quanta " . Max Planck received the 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics " in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta " .
In 1943 , at the age of 16 , Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the Grenadier Guards , of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year . As she approached her 18th birthday , parliament changed the law so that she could act as one of five Counsellors of State in the event of her father 's incapacity or absence abroad , such as his visit to Italy in July 1944 . In February 1945 , she joined the Women 's Auxiliary Territorial Service as an honorary second subaltern with the service number of 230873 . She trained as a driver and mechanic and was promoted to honorary junior commander five months later .
Victoria 's father was Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn , the fourth son of the reigning King of the United Kingdom , George III . Until 1817 , Edward 's niece , Princess Charlotte of Wales , was the only legitimate grandchild of George III . Her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children . In 1818 he married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld , a widowed German princess with two children—Carl ( 1804–1856 ) and Feodora ( 1807–1872 ) —by her first marriage to the Prince of Leiningen . Her brother Leopold was Princess Charlotte 's widower . The Duke and Duchess of Kent 's only child , Victoria , was born at 4.15 a.m. on 24 May 1819 at Kensington Palace in London .
According to Walter Gratzer , the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century BC . In China , the concept of Qi developed , a spirit or " wind " similar to what Western Europeans later called pneuma . Food was classified into " hot " ( for example , meats , blood , ginger , and hot spices ) and " cold " ( green vegetables ) in China , India , Malaya , and Persia . Humours developed perhaps first in China alongside qi . Ho the Physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements ( Wu Xing : fire , water , earth , wood , and metal ) , and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets . About the same time in Italy , Alcmaeon of Croton ( a Greek ) wrote of the importance of equilibrium between what goes in and what goes out , and warned that imbalance would result disease marked by obesity or emaciation .
During the administration of U.S. President Martin Van Buren , nearly 17,000 Cherokees—along with approximately 2,000 black slaves owned by Cherokees—were uprooted from their homes between 1838 and 1839 and were forced by the U.S. military to march from " emigration depots " in Eastern Tennessee ( such as Fort Cass ) toward the more distant Indian Territory west of Arkansas . During this relocation an estimated 4,000 Cherokees died along the way west . In the Cherokee language , the event is called Nunna daul Isunyi— " the Trail Where We Cried . " The Cherokees were not the only American Indians forced to emigrate as a result of the Indian removal efforts of the United States , and so the phrase " Trail of Tears " is sometimes used to refer to similar events endured by other American Indian peoples , especially among the " Five Civilized Tribes " . The phrase originated as a description of the earlier emigration of the Choctaw nation .
Parasitoids are organisms living in or on their host and feeding directly upon it , eventually leading to its death . They are much like parasites in their close symbiotic relationship with their host or hosts . Like the previous two classifications parasitoid predators do not kill their hosts instantly . However , unlike parasites , they are very similar to true predators in that the fate of their prey is quite inevitably death . A well-known example of a parasitoids are the ichneumon wasps , solitary insects living a free life as an adult , then laying eggs on or in another species such as a caterpillar . Its larva ( e ) feed on the growing host causing it little harm at first , but soon devouring the internal organs until finally destroying the nervous system resulting in prey death . By this stage the young wasp ( s ) are developed sufficiently to move to the next stage in their life cycle . Though limited mainly to the insect order Hymenoptera , Diptera and Coleoptera parasitoids make up as much as 10 % of all insect species .
In 77 BC , the senate sent one of Sulla 's former lieutenants , Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ( " Pompey the Great " ) , to put down an uprising in Spain . By 71 BC , Pompey returned to Rome after having completed his mission . Around the same time , another of Sulla 's former lieutenants , Marcus Licinius Crassus , had just put down the Spartacus-led gladiator/slave revolt in Italy . Upon their return , Pompey and Crassus found the populares party fiercely attacking Sulla 's constitution . They attempted to forge an agreement with the populares party . If both Pompey and Crassus were elected consul in 70 BC , they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of Sulla 's constitution . The two were soon elected , and quickly dismantled most of Sulla 's constitution .
After Richard 's death on 6 April 1199 there were two potential claimants to the Angevin throne : John , whose claim rested on being the sole surviving son of Henry II , and young Arthur I of Brittany , who held a claim as the son of John 's elder brother Geoffrey . Richard appears to have started to recognise John as his heir presumptive in the final years before his death , but the matter was not clear-cut and medieval law gave little guidance as to how the competing claims should be decided . With Norman law favouring John as the only surviving son of Henry II and Angevin law favouring Arthur as the only son of Henry 's elder son , the matter rapidly became an open conflict . John was supported by the bulk of the English and Norman nobility and was crowned at Westminster , backed by his mother , Eleanor . Arthur was supported by the majority of the Breton , Maine and Anjou nobles and received the support of Philip II , who remained committed to breaking up the Angevin territories on the continent . With Arthur 's army pressing up the Loire valley towards Angers and Philip 's forces moving down the valley towards Tours , John 's continental empire was in danger of being cut in two .
Students attending BYU are required to follow an honor code , which mandates behavior in line with LDS teachings such as academic honesty , adherence to dress and grooming standards , and abstinence from extramarital sex and from the consumption of drugs and alcohol . Many students ( 88 percent of men , 33 percent of women ) either delay enrollment or take a hiatus from their studies to serve as Mormon missionaries . ( Men typically serve for two-years , while women serve for 18 months . ) An education at BYU is also less expensive than at similar private universities , since " a significant portion " of the cost of operating the university is subsidized by the church 's tithing funds .
However , Lok-Ham Chan , a professor of history at the University of Washington , writes that Changchub Gyaltsen 's aims were to recreate the old Tibetan Kingdom that existed during the Chinese Tang dynasty , to build " nationalist sentiment " amongst Tibetans , and to " remove all traces of Mongol suzerainty . " Georges Dreyfus , a professor of religion at Williams College , writes that it was Changchub Gyaltsen who adopted the old administrative system of Songtsän Gampo ( c. 605–649 ) —the first leader of the Tibetan Empire to establish Tibet as a strong power—by reinstating its legal code of punishments and administrative units . For example , instead of the 13 governorships established by the Mongol Sakya viceroy , Changchub Gyaltsen divided Central Tibet into districts ( dzong ) with district heads ( dzong dpon ) who had to conform to old rituals and wear clothing styles of old Imperial Tibet . Van Praag asserts that Changchub Gyaltsen 's ambitions were to " restore to Tibet the glories of its Imperial Age " by reinstating secular administration , promoting " national culture and traditions , " and installing a law code that survived into the 20th century .
A Macau resident was arrested on April 26 for posting a message on cyberctm.com encouraging people to disrupt the relay . Both orchidbbs.com and cyberctm.com Internet forums were shut down from May 2 to 4 . This fueled speculation that the shutdowns were targeting speeches against the relay . The head of the Bureau of Telecommunications Regulation has denied that the shutdowns of the websites were politically motivated . About 2,200 police were deployed on the streets , there were no interruptions .
On August 19 , 1989 , the Russian Orthodox Parish of Saints Peter and Paul announced it would be switching to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church . On September 2 , 1989 , tens of thousands across Ukraine protested a draft election law that reserved special seats for the Communist Party and for other official organizations : 50,000 in Lviv , 40,000 in Kiev , 10,000 in Zhytomyr , 5,000 each in Dniprodzerzhynsk and Chervonohrad , and 2,000 in Kharkiv . From September 8–10 , 1989 , writer Ivan Drach was elected to head Rukh , the People 's Movement of Ukraine , at its founding congress in Kiev . On September 17 , between 150,000 and 200,000 people marched in Lviv , demanding the legalization of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church . On September 21 , 1989 , exhumation of a mass grave begins in Demianiv Laz , a nature preserve south of Ivano-Frankivsk . On September 28 , First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Ukraine Volodymyr Shcherbytsky , a holdover from the Brezhnev era , was replaced by Vladimir Ivashko .
In March 2003 the BBC announced that from the end of May 2003 ( subsequently deferred to 14 July ) it intended to transmit all eight of its domestic television channels ( including the 15 regional variations of BBC 1 ) unencrypted from the Astra 2D satellite . This move was estimated to save the BBC £85 million over the next five years .
Paris is home to the association football club Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade Français . The 80,000-seat Stade de France , built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup , is located just north of Paris in the commune of Saint-Denis . Paris hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros . Paris played host to the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics , the 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups , and the 2007 Rugby World Cup . Every July , the Tour de France of cycling finishes in the city .
Scotland , meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom . In 1603 , that changed when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England , and consequently the Crown of Ireland also . The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval , religious division and war . English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster . Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament . A prime issue was , inter alia , over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism . The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England . Ireland , largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king . Following defeat to the parliaments army , large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English ( Hiberno-Norman ) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland . The new ruling class was Protestant and British , whilst the common people were largely Catholic and Irish . This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come . When the monarchy was restored in England , the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland . The " Glorious Revolution " of 1688 repeated similar themes : a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England . The king 's army was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial Battle of Aughrim in Ireland . Resistance held out , and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the Treaty of Limerick . However , in the evolving political climate , the terms of Limerick were superseded , a new monarchy was installed , and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws , which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics .
Houston ( i/ˈhjuːstən/ HYOO-stən ) is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth most populous city in the United States , located in Southeast Texas near the Gulf of Mexico . With a census-estimated 2014 population of 2.239 million people , within a land area of 599.6 square miles ( 1,553 km2 ) , it also is the largest city in the Southern United States , as well as the seat of Harris County . It is the principal city of Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land , which is the fifth most populated metropolitan area in the United States .
Muammar Gaddafi was born in a tent near Qasr Abu Hadi , a rural area outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of western Libya . His family came from a small , relatively un-influential tribal group called the Qadhadhfa , who were Arabized Berber in heritage . His father , Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad , was known as Abu Meniar ( died 1985 ) , and his mother was named Aisha ( died 1978 ) ; Abu Meniar earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder . Nomadic Bedouins , they were illiterate and kept no birth records . As such , Gaddafi 's date of birth is not known with certainty , and sources have set it in 1942 or in the spring of 1943 , although biographers Blundy and Lycett noted that it could have been pre-1940 . His parents ' only surviving son , he had three older sisters . Gaddafi 's upbringing in Bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life . He repeatedly expressed a preference for the desert over the city and retreated to the desert to meditate .
Other platings used are OSP ( organic surface protectant ) , immersion silver ( IAg ) , immersion tin , electroless nickel with immersion gold coating ( ENIG ) , electroless nickel electroless palladium immersion gold ( ENEPIG ) and direct gold plating ( over nickel ) . Edge connectors , placed along one edge of some boards , are often nickel plated then gold plated . Another coating consideration is rapid diffusion of coating metal into Tin solder . Tin forms intermetallics such as Cu5Sn6 and Ag3Cu that dissolve into the Tin liquidus or solidus ( @ 50C ) , stripping surface coating or leaving voids .
18th century governors tried to tackle the island 's problems by implementing tree plantation , improving fortifications , eliminating corruption , building a hospital , tackling the neglect of crops and livestock , controlling the consumption of alcohol and introducing legal reforms . From about 1770 , the island enjoyed a lengthy period of prosperity . Captain James Cook visited the island in 1775 on the final leg of his second circumnavigation of the world . St. James ' Church was erected in Jamestown in 1774 and in 1791–92 Plantation House was built , and has since been the official residence of the Governor .
Soon Lutyens started considering other places . Indeed , the Delhi Town Planning Committee , set up to plan the new imperial capital , with George Swinton as chairman and John A. Brodie and Lutyens as members , submitted reports for both North and South sites . However , it was rejected by the Viceroy when the cost of acquiring the necessary properties was found to be too high . The central axis of New Delhi , which today faces east at India Gate , was previously meant to be a north-south axis linking the Viceroy 's House at one end with Paharganj at the other . During the project 's early years , many tourists believed it was a gate from Earth to Heaven itself . Eventually , owing to space constraints and the presence of a large number of heritage sites in the North side , the committee settled on the South site . A site atop the Raisina Hill , formerly Raisina Village , a Meo village , was chosen for the Rashtrapati Bhawan , then known as the Viceroy 's House . The reason for this choice was that the hill lay directly opposite the Dinapanah citadel , which was also considered the site of Indraprastha , the ancient region of Delhi . Subsequently , the foundation stone was shifted from the site of Delhi Durbar of 1911–1912 , where the Coronation Pillar stood , and embedded in the walls of the forecourt of the Secretariat . The Rajpath , also known as King 's Way , stretched from the India Gate to the Rashtrapati Bhawan . The Secretariat building , the two blocks of which flank the Rashtrapati Bhawan and houses ministries of the Government of India , and the Parliament House , both designed by Herbert Baker , are located at the Sansad Marg and run parallel to the Rajpath .
In the early 20th century Valencia was an industrialised city . The silk industry had disappeared , but there was a large production of hides and skins , wood , metals and foodstuffs , this last with substantial exports , particularly of wine and citrus . Small businesses predominated , but with the rapid mechanisation of industry larger companies were being formed . The best expression of this dynamic was in the regional exhibitions , including that of 1909 held next to the pedestrian avenue L'Albereda ( Paseo de la Alameda ) , which depicted the progress of agriculture and industry . Among the most architecturally successful buildings of the era were those designed in the Art Nouveau style , such as the North Station ( Gare du Nord ) and the Central and Columbus markets .
In September 1940 , during the Second World War , pro-Gaullist French officers took control of Ubangi-Shari and General Leclerc established his headquarters for the Free French Forces in Bangui . In 1946 Barthélémy Boganda was elected with 9,000 votes to the French National Assembly , becoming the first representative for CAR in the French government . Boganda maintained a political stance against racism and the colonial regime but gradually became disheartened with the French political system and returned to CAR to establish the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa ( MESAN ) in 1950 .
Bushi was the name given to the ancient Japanese soldiers from traditional warrior families . The bushi class was developed mainly in the north of Japan . They formed powerful clans , which in the 12th century were against the noble families who were grouping themselves to support the imperial family who lived in Kyoto . Samurai was a word used by the Kuge aristocratic class with warriors themselves preferring the word bushi . The term Bushidō , the " way of the warrior " , is derived from this term and the mansion of a warrior was called bukeyashiki .
It is possible that around 62 million people died in the war ; estimates vary greatly . About 60 % of all casualties were civilians , who died as a result of disease , starvation , genocide ( in particular , the Holocaust ) , and aerial bombing . The former Soviet Union and China suffered the most casualties . Estimates place deaths in the Soviet Union at around 23 million , while China suffered about 10 million . No country lost a greater portion of its population than Poland : approximately 5.6 million , or 16 % , of its pre-war population of 34.8 million died .
For many years Arsenal 's away colours were white shirts and either black or white shorts . In the 1969–70 season , Arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts . This kit was worn in the 1971 FA Cup Final as Arsenal beat Liverpool to secure the double for the first time in their history . Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again the following year wearing the red and white home strip and were beaten by Leeds United . Arsenal then competed in three consecutive FA Cup finals between 1978 and 1980 wearing their " lucky " yellow and blue strip , which remained the club 's away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in 1982–83 . The following season , Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme , albeit with a darker shade of blue than before .
The adolescent growth spurt is a rapid increase in the individual 's height and weight during puberty resulting from the simultaneous release of growth hormones , thyroid hormones , and androgens . Males experience their growth spurt about two years later , on average , than females . During their peak height velocity ( the time of most rapid growth ) , adolescents grow at a growth rate nearly identical to that of a toddler—about 4 inches ( 10.3 cm ) a year for males and 3.5 inches ( 9 cm ) for females . In addition to changes in height , adolescents also experience a significant increase in weight ( Marshall , 1978 ) . The weight gained during adolescence constitutes nearly half of one 's adult body weight . Teenage and early adult males may continue to gain natural muscle growth even after puberty .
Birds have wings which are more or less developed depending on the species ; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moas and elephant birds . Wings , which evolved from forelimbs , give most birds the ability to fly , although further speciation has led to some flightless birds , including ratites , penguins , and diverse endemic island species of birds . The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight . Some bird species of aquatic environments , particularly the aforementioned flightless penguins , and also members of the duck family , have also evolved for swimming . Birds , specifically Darwin 's finches , played an important part in the inception of Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection .
From 1898 , it was commonly accepted that the name was of Celtic origin and meant place belonging to a man called *Londinos ; this explanation has since been rejected . Richard Coates put forward an explanation in 1998 that it is derived from the pre-Celtic Old European * ( p ) lowonida , meaning 'river too wide to ford ' , and suggested that this was a name given to the part of the River Thames which flows through London ; from this , the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name , *Lowonidonjon ; this requires quite a serious amendment however . The ultimate difficulty lies in reconciling the Latin form Londinium with the modern Welsh Llundain , which should demand a form * ( h ) lōndinion ( as opposed to *londīnion ) , from earlier *loundiniom . The possibility can not be ruled out that the Welsh name was borrowed back in from English at a later date , and thus can not be used as a basis from which to reconstruct the original name .
The town of Stalybridge in Cheshire is thought to have the pubs with both the longest and shortest names in the United Kingdom — The Old 13th Cheshire Rifleman Corps Inn and the Q Inn .
The Times faced financial extinction in 1890 under Arthur Fraser Walter , but it was rescued by an energetic editor , Charles Frederic Moberly Bell . During his tenure ( 1890–1911 ) , The Times became associated with selling the Encyclopædia Britannica using aggressive American marketing methods introduced by Horace Everett Hooper and his advertising executive , Henry Haxton . Due to legal fights between the Britannica 's two owners , Hooper and Walter Montgomery Jackson , The Times severed its connection in 1908 and was bought by pioneering newspaper magnate , Alfred Harmsworth , later Lord Northcliffe .
In Fall 2008 , Northwestern opened a campus in Education City , Doha , Qatar , joining five other American universities : Carnegie Mellon University , Cornell University , Georgetown University , Texas A & M University , and Virginia Commonwealth University . Through the Medill School of Journalism and School of Communication , NU-Q offers bachelor 's degrees in journalism and communication respectively . The Qatar Foundation for Education , Science and Community Development provided funding for construction and administrative costs as well as support to hire 50 to 60 faculty and staff , some of whom rotate between the Evanston and Qatar campuses . In February 2016 , Northwestern reached an agreement with the Qatar Foundation to extend the operations of the NU-Q branch for an additional decade , through the 2027-2028 academic year .
The first British patent for the use of asphalt/bitumen was 'Cassell 's patent asphalte or bitumen ' in 1834 . Then on 25 November 1837 , Richard Tappin Claridge patented the use of Seyssel asphalt ( patent # 7849 ) , for use in asphalte pavement , having seen it employed in France and Belgium when visiting with Frederick Walter Simms , who worked with him on the introduction of asphalt to Britain . Dr T. Lamb Phipson writes that his father , Samuel Ryland Phipson , a friend of Claridge , was also " instrumental in introducing the asphalte pavement ( in 1836 ) " . Indeed , mastic pavements had been previously employed at Vauxhall by a competitor of Claridge , but without success .
Following a headlining set at Coachella 2011 that was described by The Hollywood Reporter as " one of greatest hip-hop sets of all time " , West released the collaborative album Watch the Throne with Jay-Z . By employing a sales strategy that released the album digitally weeks before its physical counterpart , Watch the Throne became one of the few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak . " Niggas in Paris " became the record 's highest charting single , peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 . In 2012 , West released the compilation album Cruel Summer , a collection of tracks by artists from West 's record label GOOD Music . Cruel Summer produced four singles , two of which charted within the top twenty of the Hot 100 : " Mercy " and " Clique " . West also directed a film of the same name that premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival in custom pyramid-shaped screening pavilion featuring seven screens .
The Richmond area also has two railroad stations served by Amtrak . Each station receives regular service from north of Richmond including Washington , D.C. , Philadelphia , and New York . The suburban Staples Mill Road Station is located on a major north-south freight line and receives all service to and from all points south including , Raleigh , Durham , Savannah , Newport News , Williamsburg and Florida . Richmond 's only railway station located within the city limits , the historic Main Street Station , was renovated in 2004 . As of 2010 , the station only receives trains headed to and from Newport News and Williamsburg due to track layout . As a result , the Staples Mill Road station receives more trains and serves more passengers overall .
Voting results have been a consistent source of controversy . The mechanism of voting had also aroused considerable criticisms , most notably in season two when Ruben Studdard beat Clay Aiken in a close vote , and in season eight , when the massive increase in text votes ( 100 million more text votes than season 7 ) fueled the texting controversy . Concerns about power voting have been expressed from the very first season . Since 2004 , votes also have been affected to a limited degree by online communities such as DialIdol , Vote for the Worst ( closed in 2013 ) , and Vote for the Girls ( started 2010 ) .
ISPs may engage in peering , where multiple ISPs interconnect at peering points or Internet exchange points ( IXs ) , allowing routing of data between each network , without charging one another for the data transmitted—data that would otherwise have passed through a third upstream ISP , incurring charges from the upstream ISP .
The India Gate built in 1931 was inspired by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris . It is the national monument of India commemorating the 90,000 soldiers of the Indian Army who lost their lives while fighting for the British Raj in World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War .
Heartwood is often visually distinct from the living sapwood , and can be distinguished in a cross-section where the boundary will tend to follow the growth rings . For example , it is sometimes much darker . However , other processes such as decay or insect invasion can also discolor wood , even in woody plants that do not form heartwood , which may lead to confusion .
Only Umayyad ruler ( Caliphs of Damascus ) , Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz , is unanimously praised by Sunni sources for his devout piety and justice . In his efforts to spread Islam he established liberties for the Mawali by abolishing the jizya tax for converts to Islam . Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam stated that Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz also stopped the personal allowance offered to his relatives stating that he could only give them an allowance if he gave an allowance to everyone else in the empire . Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz was later poisoned in the year 720 . When successive governments tried to reverse Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz 's tax policies it created rebellion .
With an educational system made up of public school districts and independent private institutions , Oklahoma had 638,817 students enrolled in 1,845 public primary , secondary , and vocational schools in 533 school districts as of 2008 [ update ] . Oklahoma has the highest enrollment of Native American students in the nation with 126,078 students in the 2009-10 school year . Ranked near the bottom of states in expenditures per student , Oklahoma spent $ 7,755 for each student in 2008 , 47th in the nation , though its growth of total education expenditures between 1992 and 2002 ranked 22nd .
In England , Presbyterianism was established in secret in 1592 . Thomas Cartwright is thought to be the first Presbyterian in England . Cartwright 's controversial lectures at Cambridge University condemning the episcopal hierarchy of the Elizabethan Church led to his deprivation of his post by Archbishop John Whitgift and his emigration abroad . Between 1645 and 1648 , a series of ordinances of the Long Parliament established Presbyterianism as the polity of the Church of England . Presbyterian government was established in London and Lancashire and in a few other places in England , although Presbyterian hostility to the execution of Charles I and the establishment of the republican Commonwealth of England meant that Parliament never enforced the Presbyterian system in England . The re-establishment of the monarchy in 1660 brought the return of Episcopal church government in England ( and in Scotland for a short time ) ; but the Presbyterian church in England continued in Non-Conformity , outside of the established church . In 1719 a major split , the Salter 's Hall controversy , occurred ; with the majority siding with nontrinitarian views . Thomas Bradbury published several sermons bearing on the controversy , and in 1719 , " An answer to the reproaches cast on the dissenting ministers who subscribed their belief of the Eternal Trinity. " . By the 18th century many English Presbyterian congregations had become Unitarian in doctrine .
In the context of political corruption , a bribe may involve a payment given to a government official in exchange of his use of official powers . Bribery requires two participants : one to give the bribe , and one to take it . Either may initiate the corrupt offering ; for example , a customs official may demand bribes to let through allowed ( or disallowed ) goods , or a smuggler might offer bribes to gain passage . In some countries the culture of corruption extends to every aspect of public life , making it extremely difficult for individuals to operate without resorting to bribes . Bribes may be demanded in order for an official to do something he is already paid to do . They may also be demanded in order to bypass laws and regulations . In addition to their role in private financial gain , bribes are also used to intentionally and maliciously cause harm to another ( i.e . no financial incentive ) . [ citation needed ] In some developing nations , up to half of the population has paid bribes during the past 12 months .
In April 2014 , it was announced that GE was in talks to acquire the global power division of French engineering group Alstom for a figure of around $ 13 billion . A rival joint bid was submitted in June 2014 by Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries ( MHI ) with Siemens seeking to acquire Alstom 's gas turbine business for €3.9 billion , and MHI proposing a joint venture in steam turbines , plus a €3.1 billion cash investment . In June 2014 a formal offer From GE worth $ 17 billion was agreed by the Alstom board . Part of the transaction involved the French government taking a 20 % stake in Alstom to help secure France 's energy and transport interests , and French jobs . A rival offer from Siemens-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was rejected . The acquisition was expected to be completed in 2015 .

The chapter house and Pyx Chamber at Westminster Abbey are in the guardianship of English Heritage , but under the care and management of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster . English Heritage have funded a major programme of work on the chapter house , comprising repairs to the roof , gutters , stonework on the elevations and flying buttresses as well as repairs to the lead light .
In the aftermath of the failed coup , militias loyal to Patassé sought revenge against rebels in many neighborhoods of Bangui and incited unrest including the murder of many political opponents . Eventually , Patassé came to suspect that General François Bozizé was involved in another coup attempt against him , which led Bozizé to flee with loyal troops to Chad . In March 2003 , Bozizé launched a surprise attack against Patassé , who was out of the country . Libyan troops and some 1,000 soldiers of Bemba 's Congolese rebel organization failed to stop the rebels and Bozizé 's forces succeeded in overthrowing Patassé . [ citation needed ]
Subsequently , Plato and Aristotle produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy , which did much to shape later investigations of nature . Their development of deductive reasoning was of particular importance and usefulness to later scientific inquiry . Plato founded the Platonic Academy in 387 BC , whose motto was " Let none unversed in geometry enter here " , and turned out many notable philosophers . Plato 's student Aristotle introduced empiricism and the notion that universal truths can be arrived at via observation and induction , thereby laying the foundations of the scientific method . Aristotle also produced many biological writings that were empirical in nature , focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life . He made countless observations of nature , especially the habits and attributes of plants and animals in the world around him , classified more than 540 animal species , and dissected at least 50 . Aristotle 's writings profoundly influenced subsequent Islamic and European scholarship , though they were eventually superseded in the Scientific Revolution .
Whites ( mainly of Afrikaner , German , British and Portuguese origin ) make up between 4.0 and 7.0 % of the population . Although their percentage of population is decreasing due to emigration and lower birth rates they still form the second-largest population of European ancestry , both in terms of percentage and actual numbers , in Sub-Saharan Africa ( after South Africa ) . The majority of Namibian whites and nearly all those who are mixed race speak Afrikaans and share similar origins , culture , and religion as the white and coloured populations of South Africa . A large minority of whites ( around 30,000 ) trace their family origins back to the German settlers who colonized Namibia prior to the British confiscation of German lands after World War One , and they maintain German cultural and educational institutions . Nearly all Portuguese settlers came to the country from the former Portuguese colony of Angola . The 1960 census reported 526,004 persons in what was then South-West Africa , including 73,464 whites ( 14 % ) .
The Great Garden is an important European baroque garden . The palace itself , however , was largely destroyed by Allied bombing but is currently under reconstruction .

The Great Garden consists of several parts . The most popular ones are the Great Ground and the Nouveau Jardin . At the centre of the Nouveau Jardin is Europe 's highest garden fountain . The historic Garden Theatre inter alia hosted the musicals of the German rock musician Heinz Rudolf Kunze . [ citation needed ]
Confederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the Army of Northern Virginia , the Confederacy 's most famous army . The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at Bentonville , which was a futile attempt by Confederate General Joseph Johnston to slow Union General William Tecumseh Sherman 's advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865 . In April 1865 , after losing the Battle of Morrisville , Johnston surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place , in what is today Durham . North Carolina 's port city of Wilmington was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union , in February 1865 , after the Union won the nearby Second Battle of Fort Fisher , its major defense downriver .
Media requests at the trade show prompted Kondo to consider using orchestral music for the other tracks in the game as well , a notion reinforced by his preference for live instruments . He originally envisioned a full 50-person orchestra for action sequences and a string quartet for more " lyrical moments " , though the final product used sequenced music instead . Kondo later cited the lack of interactivity that comes with orchestral music as one of the main reasons for the decision . Both six- and seven-track versions of the game 's soundtrack were released on November 19 , 2006 , as part of a Nintendo Power promotion and bundled with replicas of the Master Sword and the Hylian Shield .
In 1988 Imperial merged with St Mary 's Hospital Medical School , becoming The Imperial College of Science , Technology and Medicine . In 1995 Imperial launched its own academic publishing house , Imperial College Press , in partnership with World Scientific . Imperial merged with the National Heart and Lung Institute in 1995 and the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School , Royal Postgraduate Medical School ( RPMS ) and the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1997 . In the same year the Imperial College School of Medicine was formally established and all of the property of Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School , the National Heart and Lung Institute and the Royal Postgraduate Medical School were transferred to Imperial as the result of the Imperial College Act 1997 . In 1998 the Sir Alexander Fleming Building was opened by Queen Elizabeth II to provide a headquarters for the College 's medical and biomedical research .
The following sulfonylureas have been commercialized for weed control : amidosulfuron , azimsulfuron , bensulfuron-methyl , chlorimuron-ethyl , ethoxysulfuron , flazasulfuron , flupyrsulfuron-methyl-sodium , halosulfuron-methyl , imazosulfuron , nicosulfuron , oxasulfuron , primisulfuron-methyl , pyrazosulfuron-ethyl , rimsulfuron , sulfometuron-methyl Sulfosulfuron , terbacil , bispyribac-sodium , cyclosulfamuron , and pyrithiobac-sodium . Nicosulfuron , triflusulfuron methyl , and chlorsulfuron are broad-spectrum herbicides that kill plants by inhibiting the enzyme acetolactate synthase . In the 1960s , more than 1 kg/ha ( 0.89 lb/acre ) crop protection chemical was typically applied , while sulfonylureates allow as little as 1 % as much material to achieve the same effect .
Many more artillery pieces had arrived and been dug into batteries . In June , a third bombardment was followed after two days by a successful attack on the Mamelon , but a follow-up assault on the Malakoff failed with heavy losses . During this time the garrison commander , Admiral Nakhimov fell on 30 June 1855.:378 Raglan having also died on 28 June . :460 In August , the Russians again made an attack towards the base at Balaclava , defended by the French , newly arrived Sardinian and Ottoman troops . :461 The resulting battle of Tchernaya was a defeat for the Russians , who suffered heavy casualties .
Street parking in urban neighborhoods is mostly controlled by the franeleros a.k.a . " viene vienes " ( lit . " come on , come on " ) , who ask drivers for a fee to park , in theory to guard the car , but with the implicit threat that the franelero will damage the car if the fee is not paid . Double parking is common ( with franeleros moving the cars as required ) , impeding on the available lanes for traffic to pass . In order to mitigate that and other problems and to raise revenue , 721 parking meters ( as of October 2013 ) , have been installed in the west-central neighborhoods Lomas de Chapultepec , Condesa , Roma , Polanco and Anzures , in operation from 8 AM to 8 PM on weekdays and charging a rate of 2 pesos per 15 minutes , with offenders ' cars booted , costing about 500 pesos to remove . 30 percent of the monthly 16 million-peso ( as of October 2013 ) income from the parking-meter system ( named " ecoParq " ) is earmarked for neighborhood improvements . The granting of the license for all zones exclusively to a new company without experience in operating parking meters , Operadora de Estacionamientos Bicentenario , has generated controversy .
The nature of government under the Angevin monarchs was ill-defined and uncertain . John 's predecessors had ruled using the principle of vis et voluntas , or " force and will " , taking executive and sometimes arbitrary decisions , often justified on the basis that a king was above the law . Both Henry II and Richard had argued that kings possessed a quality of " divine majesty " ; John continued this trend and claimed an " almost imperial status " for himself as ruler . During the 12th century , there were contrary opinions expressed about the nature of kingship , and many contemporary writers believed that monarchs should rule in accordance with the custom and the law , and take counsel of the leading members of the realm . There was as yet no model for what should happen if a king refused to do so . Despite his claim to unique authority within England , John would sometimes justify his actions on the basis that he had taken council with the barons . Modern historians remain divided as to whether John suffered from a case of " royal schizophrenia " in his approach to government , or if his actions merely reflected the complex model of Angevin kingship in the early 13th century .
When maintenance is performed on asphalt pavements , such as milling to remove a worn or damaged surface , the removed material can be returned to a facility for processing into new pavement mixtures . The asphalt/bitumen in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes . With some 95 % of paved roads being constructed of or surfaced with asphalt , a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year . According to industry surveys conducted annually by the Federal Highway Administration and the National Asphalt Pavement Association , more than 99 % of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements , roadbeds , shoulders and embankments .
The last decades of the 19th century saw concerted political campaigns for Irish home rule . Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the Act of Union 1800 after the Irish Rebellion of 1798 , and had suffered a severe famine between 1845 and 1852 . Home rule was supported by the British Prime minister , William Gladstone , who hoped that Ireland might follow in Canada 's footsteps as a Dominion within the empire , but his 1886 Home Rule bill was defeated in Parliament . Although the bill , if passed , would have granted Ireland less autonomy within the UK than the Canadian provinces had within their own federation , many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a security threat to Great Britain or mark the beginning of the break-up of the empire . A second Home Rule bill was also defeated for similar reasons . A third bill was passed by Parliament in 1914 , but not implemented because of the outbreak of the First World War leading to the 1916 Easter Rising .
The Duke and Duchess of York had two children : Elizabeth ( called " Lilibet " by the family ) , and Margaret . The Duke and Duchess and their two daughters lived a relatively sheltered life at their London residence , 145 Piccadilly . They were a close and loving family . One of the few stirs arose when the Canadian Prime Minister , R. B. Bennett , considered the Duke for Governor General of Canada in 1931—a proposal that King George V rejected on the advice of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs , J. H. Thomas .
Larry Heard , a.k.a . " Mr . Fingers " , claims that the term " house " became popular due to many of the early DJs creating music in their own homes using synthesizers and drum machines such as the Roland TR-808 , TR-909 , and the TB 303 . [ citation needed ] These synthesizers were used to create a house subgenre called acid house .
In signal processing , data compression , source coding , or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation . Compression can be either lossy or lossless . Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy . No information is lost in lossless compression . Lossy compression reduces bits by identifying unnecessary information and removing it . The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression . In the context of data transmission , it is called source coding ( encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted ) in opposition to channel coding .
Crystal Bowersox , who has Type-I diabetes , fell ill due to diabetic ketoacidosis on the morning of the girls performance night for the top 20 week and was hospitalized . The schedule was rearranged so the boys performed first and she could perform the following night instead ; she later revealed that Ken Warwick , the show producer , wanted to disqualify her but she begged to be allowed to stay on the show .
Human interference has nearly exterminated the trees in many areas , and , except for the beech forests of the Austrian Alps , forests of deciduous trees are rarely found after the extreme deforestation between the 17th and 19th centuries . The vegetation has changed since the second half of the 20th century , as the high alpine meadows cease to be harvested for hay or used for grazing which eventually might result in a regrowth of forest . In some areas the modern practice of building ski runs by mechanical means has destroyed the underlying tundra from which the plant life can not recover during the non-skiing months , whereas areas that still practice a natural piste type of ski slope building preserve the fragile underlayers .
The Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service ( COATS ) consists of officers and non-commissioned members who conduct training , safety , supervision and administration of nearly 60,000 cadets aged 12 to 18 years in the Canadian Cadet Movement . The majority of members in COATS are officers of the Cadet Instructors Cadre ( CIC ) branch of the CAF . Members of the Reserve Force Sub-Component COATS who are not employed part-time ( Class A ) or full-time ( Class B ) may be held on the " Cadet Instructor Supplementary Staff List " ( CISS List ) in anticipation of employment in the same manner as other reservists are held as members of the Supplementary Reserve .
Saint Helena was first settled by the English in 1659 , and the island has a population of about 4,250 inhabitants , mainly descended from people from Britain – settlers ( " planters " ) and soldiers – and slaves who were brought there from the beginning of settlement – initially from Africa ( the Cape Verde Islands , Gold Coast and west coast of Africa are mentioned in early records ) , then India and Madagascar . Eventually the planters felt there were too many slaves and no more were imported after 1792 .
By 1989 Germany was nearing reunification and the Cold War was coming to a close . Army leadership reacted by starting to plan for a reduction in strength . By November 1989 Pentagon briefers were laying out plans to reduce army end strength by 23 % , from 750,000 to 580,000 . A number of incentives such as early retirement were used . In 1990 Iraq invaded its smaller neighbor , Kuwait , and U.S. land forces , quickly deployed to assure the protection of Saudi Arabia . In January 1991 Operation Desert Storm commenced , a U.S.-led coalition which deployed over 500,000 troops , the bulk of them from U.S. Army formations , to drive out Iraqi forces . The campaign ended in total victory , as Western coalition forces routed the Iraqi Army , organized along Soviet lines , in just one hundred hours .
Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the first of many to present the Alps as a place of allure and beauty , banishing the prevalent conception of the mountains as a hellish wasteland inhabited by demons . Rousseau 's conception of alpine purity was later emphasized with the publication of Albrecht von Haller 's poem Die Alpen that described the mountains as an area of mythical purity . Late in the 18th century the first wave of Romantics such as Goethe and Turner came to admire the scenery ; Wordsworth visited the area in 1790 , writing of his experiences in The Prelude . Schiller later wrote the play William Tell romanticising Swiss independence . After the end of the Napoleonic Wars , the Alpine countries began to see an influx of poets , artists , and musicians , as visitors came to experience the sublime effects of monumental nature .
In his book The Crucifixion of Jesus , physician and forensic pathologist Frederick Zugibe studied the likely circumstances of the death of Jesus in great detail . Zugibe carried out a number of experiments over several years to test his theories while he was a medical examiner . These studies included experiments in which volunteers with specific weights were hanging at specific angles and the amount of pull on each hand was measured , in cases where the feet were also secured or not . In these cases the amount of pull and the corresponding pain was found to be significant .
The Houston Theater District , located downtown , is home to nine major performing arts organizations and six performance halls . It is the second-largest concentration of theater seats in a downtown area in the United States . Houston is one of few United States cities with permanent , professional , resident companies in all major performing arts disciplines : opera ( Houston Grand Opera ) , ballet ( Houston Ballet ) , music ( Houston Symphony Orchestra ) , and theater ( The Alley Theatre ) . Houston is also home to folk artists , art groups and various small progressive arts organizations . Houston attracts many touring Broadway acts , concerts , shows , and exhibitions for a variety of interests . Facilities in the Theater District include the Jones Hall—home of the Houston Symphony Orchestra and Society for the Performing Arts—and the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts .
In March 2008 , it was announced that Avicenna 's name would be used for new Directories of education institutions for health care professionals , worldwide . The Avicenna Directories will list universities and schools where doctors , public health practitioners , pharmacists and others , are educated . The project team stated " Why Avicenna ? Avicenna ... was ... noted for his synthesis of knowledge from both east and west . He has had a lasting influence on the development of medicine and health sciences . The use of Avicenna 's name symbolises the worldwide partnership that is needed for the promotion of health services of high quality . "
New Haven is a notable center for higher education . Yale University , at the heart of downtown , is one of the city 's best known features and its largest employer . New Haven is also home to Southern Connecticut State University , part of the Connecticut State University System , and Albertus Magnus College , a private institution . Gateway Community College has a campus in downtown New Haven , formerly located in the Long Wharf district ; Gateway consolidated into one campus downtown into a new state-of-the-art campus ( on the site of the old Macy 's building ) and was open for the Fall 2012 semester .
Similarly , forensic anthropologists draw on highly heritable morphological features of human remains ( e.g . cranial measurements ) to aid in the identification of the body , including in terms of race . In a 1992 article , anthropologist Norman Sauer noted that anthropologists had generally abandoned the concept of race as a valid representation of human biological diversity , except for forensic anthropologists . He asked , " If races do n't exist , why are forensic anthropologists so good at identifying them ? " He concluded :
Regarding the timing of German rapprochement , many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov , whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany , removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany . Stalin immediately directed Molotov to " purge the ministry of Jews . " Given Litvinov 's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition , association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain , and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin , his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany . [ f ] Likewise , Molotov 's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers . The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany . One British official wrote that Litvinov 's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber , while Molotov 's " modus operandi " was " more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan . " Carr argued that the Soviet Union 's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3 , 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany , but rather was Stalin 's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man , namely Molotov , to the Foreign Commissariat . Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations , but that they did not abandon British–French talks . Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany . Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov 's dismissal helped the Soviets with British–French talks , because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions .
Prior to the designation of immunity from the etymological root immunis , which is Latin for " exempt " ; early physicians characterized organs that would later be proven as essential components of the immune system . The important lymphoid organs of the immune system are the thymus and bone marrow , and chief lymphatic tissues such as spleen , tonsils , lymph vessels , lymph nodes , adenoids , and liver . When health conditions worsen to emergency status , portions of immune system organs including the thymus , spleen , bone marrow , lymph nodes and other lymphatic tissues can be surgically excised for examination while patients are still alive .
In 2012 , news was released about a new farming site discovered in Munam-ri , Goseong , Gangwon Province , South Korea , which may be the earliest farmland known to date in east Asia . " No remains of an agricultural field from the Neolithic period have been found in any East Asian country before , the institute said , adding that the discovery reveals that the history of agricultural cultivation at least began during the period on the Korean Peninsula " . The farm was dated between 3600 and 3000 B.C . Pottery , stone projectile points , and possible houses were also found . " In 2002 , researchers discovered prehistoric earthenware , jade earrings , among other items in the area " . The research team will perform accelerator mass spectrometry ( AMS ) dating to retrieve a more precise date for the site .
Sport plays an important role in Estonian culture . After declaring independence from Russia in 1918 , Estonia first competed as a nation at the 1920 Summer Olympics , although the National Olympic Committee was established in 1923 . Estonian athletes took part of the Olympic Games until the country was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 . The 1980 Summer Olympics Sailing regatta was held in the capital city Tallinn . After regaining independence in 1991 , Estonia has participated in all Olympics . Estonia has won most of its medals in athletics , weightlifting , wrestling and cross-country skiing . Estonia has had very good success at the Olympic games given the country 's small population . Estonia 's best results were being ranked 13th in the medal table at the 1936 Summer Olympics , and 12th at the 2006 Winter Olympics .
Cyclone Bebe in 1972 caused severe damage to Funafuti . Funafuti 's Tepuka Vili Vili islet was devastated by Cyclone Meli in 1979 , with all its vegetation and most of its sand swept away during the cyclone . Along with a tropical depression that affected the islands a few days later , Severe Tropical Cyclone Ofa had a major impact on Tuvalu with most islands reporting damage to vegetation and crops . Cyclone Gavin was first identified during 2 March 1997 , and was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1996–97 cyclone season with Cyclones Hina and Keli following later in the season .
Originally , legislative power was exercised by the sovereign acting on the advice of the Curia Regis , or Royal Council , in which important magnates and clerics participated and which evolved into parliament . The so-called Model Parliament included bishops , abbots , earls , barons , and two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough among its members . In 1265 , the Earl of Leicester irregularly called a full parliament without royal authorisation . The body eventually came to be divided into two branches : bishops , abbots , earls , and barons formed the House of Lords , while the shire and borough representatives formed the House of Commons . The King would seek the advice and consent of both houses before making any law . During Henry VI 's reign , it became regular practice for the two houses to originate legislation in the form of bills , which would not become law unless the sovereign 's assent was obtained , as the sovereign was , and still remains , the enactor of laws . Hence , all acts include the clause " Be it enacted by the Queen 's ( King 's ) most Excellent Majesty , by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal , and Commons , in this present Parliament assembled , and by the authority of the same , as follows ... " . The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 provide a second potential preamble if the House of Lords were to be excluded from the process .
From the middle of the 18th century , exploration and publication changed the course of British architecture towards a purer vision of the Ancient Greco-Roman ideal . James 'Athenian ' Stuart 's work The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece was very influential in this regard , as were Robert Wood 's Palmyra and Baalbec . A combination of simple forms and high levels of enrichment was adopted by the majority of contemporary British architects and designers . The revolution begun by Stuart was soon to be eclipsed by the work of the Adam Brothers , James Wyatt , Sir William Chambers , George Dance , James Gandon and provincially based architects such as John Carr and Thomas Harrison of Chester .
In testimony before the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science , and Transportation on June 3 , 2008 , former director of the CFTC Division of Trading & Markets ( responsible for enforcement ) Michael Greenberger specifically named the Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange , founded by Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and BP as playing a key role in speculative run-up of oil futures prices traded off the regulated futures exchanges in London and New York . However , the IntercontinentalExchange ( ICE ) had been regulated by both European and U.S. authorities since its purchase of the International Petroleum Exchange in 2001 . Mr Greenberger was later corrected on this matter .
This technique was very expensive , though , and could not be used for applications such as telemedicine , distance education , and business meetings . Attempts at using normal telephony networks to transmit slow-scan video , such as the first systems developed by AT & T Corporation , first researched in the 1950s , failed mostly due to the poor picture quality and the lack of efficient video compression techniques . The greater 1 MHz bandwidth and 6 Mbit/s bit rate of the Picturephone in the 1970s also did not achieve commercial success , mostly due to its high cost , but also due to a lack of network effect —with only a few hundred Picturephones in the world , users had extremely few contacts they could actually call to , and interoperability with other videophone systems would not exist for decades .
In May 1778 , Burke supported a parliamentary motion revising restrictions on Irish trade . His constituents , citizens of the great trading city of Bristol , however urged Burke to oppose free trade with Ireland . Burke resisted their protestations and said : " If , from this conduct , I shall forfeit their suffrages at an ensuing election , it will stand on record an example to future representatives of the Commons of England , that one man at least had dared to resist the desires of his constituents when his judgment assured him they were wrong " .
Paris and its close suburbs is home to numerous newspapers , magazines and publications including Le Monde , Le Figaro , Libération , Le Nouvel Observateur , Le Canard enchaîné , La Croix , Pariscope , Le Parisien ( in Saint-Ouen ) , Les Échos , Paris Match ( Neuilly-sur-Seine ) , Réseaux & Télécoms , Reuters France , and L'Officiel des Spectacles . France 's two most prestigious newspapers , Le Monde and Le Figaro , are the centrepieces of the Parisian publishing industry . Agence France-Presse is France 's oldest , and one of the world 's oldest , continually operating news agencies . AFP , as it is colloquially abbreviated , maintains its headquarters in Paris , as it has since 1835 . France 24 is a television news channel owned and operated by the French government , and is based in Paris . Another news agency is France Diplomatie , owned and operated by the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs , and pertains solely to diplomatic news and occurrences .
On July 1 , 2014 , the University of Notre Dame and Under Armour reached an agreement in which Under Armour will provide uniforms , apparel , equipment , and monetary compensation to Notre Dame for 10 years . This contract , worth almost $ 100 million , is the most lucrative in the history of the NCAA . The university marching band plays at home games for most of the sports . The band , which began in 1846 and has a claim as the oldest university band in continuous existence in the United States , was honored by the National Music Council as a " Landmark of American Music " during the United States Bicentennial . The band regularly plays the school 's fight song the Notre Dame Victory March , which was named as the most played and most famous fight song by Northern Illinois Professor William Studwell . According to College Fight Songs : An Annotated Anthology published in 1998 , the " Notre Dame Victory March " ranks as the greatest fight song of all time .
Russell 's ministry , though Whig , was not favoured by the Queen . She found particularly offensive the Foreign Secretary , Lord Palmerston , who often acted without consulting the Cabinet , the Prime Minister , or the Queen . Victoria complained to Russell that Palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without her knowledge , but Palmerston was retained in office and continued to act on his own initiative , despite her repeated remonstrances . It was only in 1851 that Palmerston was removed after he announced the British government 's approval of President Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte 's coup in France without consulting the Prime Minister . The following year , President Bonaparte was declared Emperor Napoleon III , by which time Russell 's administration had been replaced by a short-lived minority government led by Lord Derby .
In 1906 , the tungsten filament was introduced . Tungsten metal was initially not available in a form that allowed it to be drawn into fine wires . Filaments made from sintered tungsten powder were quite fragile . By 1910 , a process was developed by William D. Coolidge at General Electric for production of a ductile form of tungsten . The process required pressing tungsten powder into bars , then several steps of sintering , swaging , and then wire drawing . It was found that very pure tungsten formed filaments that sagged in use , and that a very small " doping " treatment with potassium , silicon , and aluminium oxides at the level of a few hundred parts per million greatly improved the life and durability of the tungsten filaments .
The Polish term " szlachta " designated the formalized , hereditary noble class of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth . In official Latin documents of the old Commonwealth , hereditary szlachta are referred to as " nobilitas " and are indeed the equivalent in legal status of the English nobility .
The quick German victory over the French stunned neutral observers , many of whom had expected a French victory and most of whom had expected a long war . The strategic advantages possessed by the Germans were not appreciated outside Germany until after hostilities had ceased . Other countries quickly discerned the advantages given to the Germans by their military system , and adopted many of their innovations , particularly the General Staff , universal conscription and highly detailed mobilization systems .
The Greek men 's national volleyball team has won two bronze medals , one in the European Volleyball Championship and another one in the European Volleyball League , a 5th place in the Olympic Games and a 6th place in the FIVB Volleyball Men 's World Championship . The Greek league , the A1 Ethniki , is considered one of the top volleyball leagues in Europe and the Greek clubs have made significant success in European competitions . Olympiacos is the most successful volleyball club in the country having won the most domestic titles and being the only Greek club to have won European titles ; they have won two CEV Cups , they have been CEV Champions League runners-up twice and they have played in as many as 12 Final Fours in the European competitions , making them one of the most traditional volleyball clubs in Europe . Iraklis have also seen significant success in European competitions , having been three times runners-up of the CEV Champions League .
Berry Gordy , Jr. founded Motown Records which rose to prominence during the 1960s and early 1970s with acts such as Stevie Wonder , The Temptations , The Four Tops , Smokey Robinson & The Miracles , Diana Ross & The Supremes , the Jackson 5 , Martha and the Vandellas , The Spinners , Gladys Knight & the Pips , The Marvelettes , The Elgins , The Monitors , The Velvelettes and Marvin Gaye . Artists were backed by in-house vocalists The Andantes and The Funk Brothers , the Motown house band that was featured in Paul Justman 's 2002 documentary film Standing in the Shadows of Motown , based on Allan Slutsky 's book of the same name .
Royal assent is the method by which a country 's constitutional monarch ( possibly through a delegated official ) formally approves an act of that nation 's parliament , thus making it a law or letting it be promulgated as law . In the vast majority of contemporary monarchies , this act is considered to be little more than a formality ; even in those nations which still permit their ruler to withhold the royal assent ( such as the United Kingdom , Norway , and Liechtenstein ) , the monarch almost never does so , save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government . While the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in European monarchies , it is exceedingly rare in the modern , democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century .
For African Americans , the one-drop rule was a significant factor in ethnic solidarity . African Americans generally shared a common cause in society regardless of their multiracial admixture , or social/economic stratification . Additionally , African Americans found it , near , impossible to learn about their Indigenous American heritage as many family elders withheld pertinent genealogical information . Tracing the genealogy of African Americans can be a very difficult process , especially for descendants of Indigenous Americans , because African Americans who were slaves were forbidden to learn to read and write , and a majority of Indigenous Americans neither spoke English , nor read or wrote it .
The two neurotransmitters that are used most widely in the vertebrate brain are glutamate , which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons , and gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , which is almost always inhibitory . Neurons using these transmitters can be found in nearly every part of the brain . Because of their ubiquity , drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects . Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate ; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA .
At Maecenas ' insistence ( according to the tradition ) Virgil spent the ensuing years ( perhaps 37–29 BC ) on the long didactic hexameter poem called the Georgics ( from Greek , " On Working the Earth " ) which he dedicated to Maecenas . The ostensible theme of the Georgics is instruction in the methods of running a farm . In handling this theme , Virgil follows in the didactic ( " how to " ) tradition of the Greek poet Hesiod 's Works and Days and several works of the later Hellenistic poets . The four books of the Georgics focus respectively on raising crops and trees ( 1 and 2 ) , livestock and horses ( 3 ) , and beekeeping and the qualities of bees ( 4 ) . Well-known passages include the beloved Laus Italiae of Book 2 , the prologue description of the temple in Book 3 , and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3 . Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative , in the form of an epyllion which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by Aristaeus and the story of Orpheus ' journey to the underworld . Ancient scholars , such as Servius , conjectured that the Aristaeus episode replaced , at the emperor 's request , a long section in praise of Virgil 's friend , the poet Gallus , who was disgraced by Augustus , and who committed suicide in 26 BC .
President Abraham Lincoln visited General Grant at Petersburg on April 3 , and took a launch to Richmond the next day , while Jefferson Davis attempted to organize his Confederate government at Danville . Lincoln met Confederate assistant secretary of War John A. Campbell , and handed him a note inviting Virginia 's legislature to end their rebellion . After Campbell spun the note to Confederate legislators as a possible end to the Emancipation Proclamation , Lincoln rescinded his offer and ordered General Weitzel to prevent the Confederate state legislature from meeting . Union forces killed , wounded or captured 8000 Confederate troops at Saylor 's Creek southwest of Petersburg on April 6 . General Lee continued to reject General Grant 's surrender suggestion until Sheridan 's infantry and cavalry appeared in front of his retreating army on April 8 . He surrendered his remaining approximately 10000 troops at Appomattox Court House the following morning . Jefferson Davis retreated to North Carolina , then further south . when Lincoln rejected the surrender terms negotiated by general Sherman and envoys of North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance , which failed to mention slavery . Davis was captured on May 10 near Irwinville , Georgia and taken back to Virginia , where he was charged with treason and imprisoned for two years at Fort Monroe until freed on bail .
An urban civilization , the Garamantes , arose around 500 BCE in the heart of the Sahara , in a valley that is now called the Wadi al-Ajal in Fezzan , Libya . The Garamantes achieved this development by digging tunnels far into the mountains flanking the valley to tap fossil water and bring it to their fields . The Garamantes grew populous and strong , conquering their neighbors and capturing many slaves ( which were put to work extending the tunnels ) . The ancient Greeks and the Romans knew of the Garamantes and regarded them as uncivilized nomads . However , they traded with the Garamantes , and a Roman bath has been found in the Garamantes capital of Garama . Archaeologists have found eight major towns and many other important settlements in the Garamantes territory . The Garamantes civilization eventually collapsed after they had depleted available water in the aquifers and could no longer sustain the effort to extend the tunnels further into the mountains .
The Roman legions first entered the area under Decimus Junius Brutus in 137–136 BC , but the country was only incorporated into the Roman Empire by the time of Augustus ( 29 BC – 19 BC ) . The Romans were interested in Galicia mainly for its mineral resources , most notably gold . Under Roman rule , most Galician hillforts began to be – sometimes forcibly – abandoned , and Gallaeci served frequently in the Roman army as auxiliary troops . Romans brought new technologies , new travel routes , new forms of organizing property , and a new language ; latin . The Roman Empire established its control over Galicia through camps ( castra ) as Aquis Querquennis , Ciadella camp or Lucus Augusti ( Lugo ) , roads ( viae ) and monuments as the lighthouse known as Tower of Hercules , in Corunna , but the remoteness and lesser interest of the country since the 2nd century of our era , when the gold mines stopped being productive , led to a lesser degree of Romanization . In the 3rd century it was made a province , under the name Gallaecia , which included also northern Portugal , Asturias , and a large section of what today is known as Castile and León .
In 1964 , Nikita Khrushchev was removed from his position of power and replaced with Leonid Brezhnev . Under his rule , the Russian SFSR and the rest of the Soviet Union went through an era of stagnation . Even after he died in 1982 , the era didn’t end until Mikhail Gorbachev took power and introduced liberal reforms in Soviet society .
Scotland , meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom . In 1603 , that changed when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England , and consequently the Crown of Ireland also . The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval , religious division and war . English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster . Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament . A prime issue was , inter alia , over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism . The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England . Ireland , largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king . Following defeat to the parliaments army , large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English ( Hiberno-Norman ) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland . The new ruling class was Protestant and British , whilst the common people were largely Catholic and Irish . This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come . When the monarchy was restored in England , the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland . The " Glorious Revolution " of 1688 repeated similar themes : a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England . The king 's army was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial Battle of Aughrim in Ireland . Resistance held out , and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the Treaty of Limerick . However , in the evolving political climate , the terms of Limerick were superseded , a new monarchy was installed , and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws , which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics .
There were aspirated stops at three places of articulation : labial , coronal , and velar /pʰ tʰ kʰ/ . Earlier Greek , represented by Mycenaean Greek , likely had a labialized velar aspirated stop /kʷʰ/ , which later became labial , coronal , or velar depending on dialect and phonetic environment .
Napoleon continued to entertain a grand scheme to establish a French presence in the Middle East in order to put pressure on Britain and Russia , and perhaps form an alliance with the Ottoman Empire . In February 1806 , Ottoman Emperor Selim III finally recognized Napoleon as Emperor . He also opted for an alliance with France , calling France " our sincere and natural ally . " That decision brought the Ottoman Empire into a losing war against Russia and Britain . A Franco-Persian alliance was also formed between Napoleon and the Persian Empire of Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar . It collapsed in 1807 , when France and Russia themselves formed an unexpected alliance . In the end , Napoleon had made no effective alliances in the Middle East .
Despite the city 's recent financial issues , many developers remain unfazed by Detroit 's problems . Midtown is one of the most successful areas within Detroit to have a residential occupancy rate of 96 % . Numerous developments have been recently completely or are in various stages of construction . These include the $ 82 million reconstruction of downtown 's David Whitney Building ( now an Aloft Hotel and luxury residences ) , the Woodward Garden Block Development in Midtown , the residential conversion of the David Broderick Tower in downtown , the rehabilitation of the Book Cadillac Hotel ( now a Westin and luxury condos ) and Fort Shelby Hotel ( now Doubletree ) also in downtown , and various smaller projects .
In addition , most Grand Lodges require the candidate to declare a belief in a Supreme Being . In a few cases , the candidate may be required to be of a specific religion . The form of Freemasonry most common in Scandinavia ( known as the Swedish Rite ) , for example , accepts only Christians . At the other end of the spectrum , " Liberal " or Continental Freemasonry , exemplified by the Grand Orient de France , does not require a declaration of belief in any deity , and accepts atheists ( a cause of discord with the rest of Freemasonry ) .
Since chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides dissolve in fats and are not excreted , organisms tend to retain them almost indefinitely . Biological magnification is the process whereby these chlorinated hydrocarbons ( pesticides ) are more concentrated at each level of the food chain . Among marine animals , pesticide concentrations are higher in carnivorous fishes , and even more so in the fish-eating birds and mammals at the top of the ecological pyramid . Global distillation is the process whereby pesticides are transported from warmer to colder regions of the Earth , in particular the Poles and mountain tops . Pesticides that evaporate into the atmosphere at relatively high temperature can be carried considerable distances ( thousands of kilometers ) by the wind to an area of lower temperature , where they condense and are carried back to the ground in rain or snow .
New York 's high rate of public transit use , over 200,000 daily cyclists as of 2014 , and many pedestrian commuters make it the most energy-efficient major city in the United States . Walk and bicycle modes of travel account for 21 % of all modes for trips in the city ; nationally the rate for metro regions is about 8 % . In both its 2011 and 2015 rankings , Walk Score named New York City the most walkable large city in the United States . Citibank sponsored the introduction of 10,000 public bicycles for the city 's bike-share project in the summer of 2013 . Research conducted by Quinnipiac University showed that a majority of New Yorkers support the initiative . New York City 's numerical " in-season cycling indicator " of bicycling in the city hit an all-time high in 2013 .
People of all ages and social statuses were depicted in the art of the Hellenistic age . Artists such as Peiraikos chose mundane and lower class subjects for his paintings . According to Pliny , " He painted barbers ' shops , cobblers ' stalls , asses , eatables and similar subjects , earning for himself the name of rhyparographos [ painter of dirt/low things ] . In these subjects he could give consummate pleasure , selling them for more than other artists received for their large pictures " ( Natural History , Book XXXV.112 ) . Even barbarians , such as the Galatians , were depicted in heroic form , prefiguring the artistic theme of the noble savage . The image of Alexander the Great was also an important artistic theme , and all of the diadochi had themselves depicted imitating Alexander 's youthful look . A number of the best-known works of Greek sculpture belong to the Hellenistic period , including Laocoön and his Sons , Venus de Milo , and the Winged Victory of Samothrace .
Maintaining the household was the main duty of samurai women . This was especially crucial during early feudal Japan , when warrior husbands were often traveling abroad or engaged in clan battles . The wife , or okugatasama ( meaning : one who remains in the home ) , was left to manage all household affairs , care for the children , and perhaps even defend the home forcibly . For this reason , many women of the samurai class were trained in wielding a polearm called a naginata or a special knife called the kaiken in an art called tantojutsu ( lit . the skill of the knife ) , which they could use to protect their household , family , and honor if the need arose .
It would appear that living organisms are remarkably inefficient ( in the physical sense ) in their use of the energy they receive ( chemical energy or radiation ) , and it is true that most real machines manage higher efficiencies . In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose , as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from . The second law of thermodynamics states that energy ( and matter ) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe : to concentrate energy ( or matter ) in one specific place , it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy ( as heat ) across the remainder of the universe ( " the surroundings " ) . [ note 3 ] Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones , but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that are not available to their simpler brethren . The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in ecology : to take just the first step in the food chain , of the estimated 124.7 Pg/a of carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis , 64.3 Pg/a ( 52 % ) are used for the metabolism of green plants , i.e . reconverted into carbon dioxide and heat .
General Bonaparte and his expedition eluded pursuit by the Royal Navy and landed at Alexandria on 1 July . He fought the Battle of Shubra Khit against the Mamluks , Egypt 's ruling military caste . This helped the French practice their defensive tactic for the Battle of the Pyramids , fought on 21 July , about 24 km ( 15 mi ) from the pyramids . General Bonaparte 's forces of 25,000 roughly equalled those of the Mamluks ' Egyptian cavalry . Twenty-nine French and approximately 2,000 Egyptians were killed . The victory boosted the morale of the French army .
Among Richmond 's most interesting architectural features is its Cast-iron architecture . Second only to New Orleans in its concentration of cast iron work , the city is home to a unique collection of cast iron porches , balconies , fences , and finials . Richmond 's position as a center of iron production helped to fuel its popularity within the city . At the height of production in the 1890 , 25 foundries operated in the city employing nearly 3,500 metal workers . This number is seven times the number of general construction workers being employed in Richmond at the time which illustrates the importance of its iron exports . Porches and fences in urban neighborhoods such as Jackson Ward , Church Hill , and Monroe Ward are particularly elaborate , often featuring ornate iron casts never replicated outside of Richmond . In some cases cast were made for a single residential or commercial application .
The pricing of risk refers to the incremental compensation required by investors for taking on additional risk , which may be measured by interest rates or fees . Several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks ' risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis , enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have , and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward , readily understandable format .
In the 1990s , initiatives were taken at an international level ( in particular by the European Community , the Council of Europe , the OECD ) to put a ban on corruption : in 1996 , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe , for instance , adopted a comprehensive Programme of Action against Corruption and , subsequently , issued a series of anti-corruption standard-setting instruments :
General Dong Zhuo ( d. 192 AD ) found the young emperor and his brother wandering in the countryside . He escorted them safely back to the capital and was made Minister of Works , taking control of Luoyang and forcing Yuan Shao to flee . After Dong Zhuo demoted Emperor Shao and promoted his brother Liu Xie as Emperor Xian , Yuan Shao led a coalition of former officials and officers against Dong , who burned Luoyang to the ground and resettled the court at Chang'an in May 191 AD . Dong Zhuo later poisoned Emperor Shao .
The community was established by several shiploads of settlers from Bermuda ( which lies due east of South Carolina , although at 1,030 km or 640 mi , it is closest to Cape Hatteras , North Carolina ) , under the leadership of governor William Sayle , on the west bank of the Ashley River , a few miles northwest of the present-day city center . It was soon predicted by the Earl of Shaftesbury , one of the Lords Proprietors , to become a " great port towne " , a destiny the city quickly fulfilled . In 1680 , the settlement was moved east of the Ashley River to the peninsula between the Ashley and Cooper Rivers . Not only was this location more defensible , but it also offered access to a fine natural harbor .
Hospitals in Liberia include the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Monrovia and several others . Life expectancy in Liberia is estimated to be 57.4 years in 2012 . With a fertility rate of 5.9 births per woman , the maternal mortality rate stood at 990 per 100,000 births in 2010 . A number of highly communicable diseases are widespread , including tuberculosis , diarrheal diseases and malaria . In 2007 , the HIV infection rates stood at 2 % of the population aged 15–49 whereas the incidence of tuberculosis was 420 per 100,000 people in 2008 . Approximately 58.2 % – 66 % of women are estimated to have undergone female genital mutilation .
Humans and animals exposed to vacuum will lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes , but the symptoms are not nearly as graphic as commonly depicted in media and popular culture . The reduction in pressure lowers the temperature at which blood and other body fluids boil , but the elastic pressure of blood vessels ensures that this boiling point remains above the internal body temperature of 37 °C . Although the blood will not boil , the formation of gas bubbles in bodily fluids at reduced pressures , known as ebullism , is still a concern . The gas may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation , but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture . Swelling and ebullism can be restrained by containment in a flight suit . Shuttle astronauts wore a fitted elastic garment called the Crew Altitude Protection Suit ( CAPS ) which prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kPa ( 15 Torr ) . Rapid boiling will cool the skin and create frost , particularly in the mouth , but this is not a significant hazard .
On 1 July 1967 , BBC Two became the first television channel in Europe to broadcast regularly in colour , using the West German PAL system that is still in use today although being gradually superseded by digital systems . ( BBC One and ITV began 625-line colour broadcasts simultaneously on 15 November 1969 ) . Unlike other terrestrial channels , BBC Two does not have soap opera or standard news programming , but a range of programmes intended to be eclectic and diverse ( although if a programme has high audience ratings it is often eventually repositioned to BBC One ) . The different remit of BBC2 allowed its first controller , Sir David Attenborough to commission the first heavyweight documentaries and documentary series such as Civilisation , The Ascent of Man and Horizon .
Concurrently , the Somali Transitional Federal Government began preparations to revive the national postal service . The government 's overall reconstruction plan for Somali Post is structured into three Phases spread out over a period of ten years . Phase I will see the reconstruction of the postal headquarters and General Post Office ( GPO ) , as well as the establishment of 16 branch offices in the capital and 17 in regional bases . As of March 2012 , the Somali authorities have re-established Somalia 's membership with the Universal Postal Union ( UPU ) , and taken part once again in the Union 's affairs . They have also rehabilitated the GPO in Mogadishu , and appointed an official Postal Consultant to provide professional advice on the renovations . Phase II of the rehabilitation project involves the construction of 718 postal outlets from 2014 to 2016 . Phase III is slated to begin in 2017 , with the objective of creating 897 postal outlets by 2022 .
Because of its simple atomic structure , consisting only of a proton and an electron , the hydrogen atom , together with the spectrum of light produced from it or absorbed by it , has been central to the development of the theory of atomic structure . Furthermore , the corresponding simplicity of the hydrogen molecule and the corresponding cation H+ 2 allowed fuller understanding of the nature of the chemical bond , which followed shortly after the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom had been developed in the mid-1920s .
An individual wrestler may sometimes use their real name , or a minor variation of it , for much of their career , such as Angelo Poffo , Ernie Ladd , Verne Gagne , Bret Hart , and Randy Orton . Others can keep one ring name for their entire career ( cases in point include Chris Jericho , Shawn Michaels , CM Punk and Ricky Steamboat ) , or may change from time to time to better suit the demands of the audience or company . Sometimes a character is owned and trademarked by the company , forcing the wrestler to find a new one when they leave ( although a simple typeset change , such as changing Rhyno to Rhino , can usually get around this ) , and sometimes a character is owned by the wrestler . Sometimes , a wrestler may change their legal name in order to obtain ownership of their ring name ( examples include Andrew Martin and Warrior ) . Many wrestlers ( such as The Rock and The Undertaker ) are strongly identified with their character , even responding to the name in public or between friends . It 's actually considered proper decorum for fellow wrestlers to refer to each other by their stage names/characters rather than their birth/legal names , unless otherwise introduced . A professional wrestling character 's popularity can grow to the point that it makes appearances in other media ( see Hulk Hogan and El Santo ) or even give the performer enough visibility to enter politics ( Antonio Inoki and Jesse Ventura , among others ) .
In March 2003 , a second rebel group , Movement for Democracy in Liberia , began launching attacks against Taylor from the southeast . Peace talks between the factions began in Accra in June of that year , and Taylor was indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone for crimes against humanity that same month . By July 2003 , the rebels had launched an assault on Monrovia . Under heavy pressure from the international community and the domestic Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace movement , Taylor resigned in August 2003 and went into exile in Nigeria .
The 100th meridian roughly corresponds with the line that divides the Great Plains into an area that receive 20 inches ( 510 millimetres ) or more of rainfall per year and an area that receives less than 20 in ( 510 mm ) . In this context , the High Plains , as well as Southern Alberta , south-western Saskatchewan and Eastern Montana are mainly semi hot steppe land and are generally characterised by rangeland or marginal farmland . The region ( especially the High Plains ) is periodically subjected to extended periods of drought ; high winds in the region may then generate devastating dust storms . The eastern Great Plains near the eastern boundary falls in the humid subtropical climate zone in the southern areas , and the northern and central areas fall in the humid continental climate .
The domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago . This may have originally been as a result of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild , but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity . Domesticated chickens may have been used for cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs , but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive-bred source of food . Selective breeding for fast growth , egg-laying ability , conformation , plumage and docility took place over the centuries , and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors . Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems , most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises . Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally and , along with eggs , provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat . All poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked in order to reduce the risk of food poisoning .
Others have argued that excessive regulation suppresses therapeutic innovation , and that the current cost of regulator-required clinical trials prevents the full exploitation of new genetic and biological knowledge for the treatment of human disease . A 2012 report by the President 's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology made several key recommendations to reduce regulatory burdens to new drug development , including 1 ) expanding the FDA 's use of accelerated approval processes , 2 ) creating an expedited approval pathway for drugs intended for use in narrowly defined populations , and 3 ) undertaking pilot projects designed to evaluate the feasibility of a new , adaptive drug approval process .
Although Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli honored Mary as the Mother of God in the 16th century , they did so less than Martin Luther . Thus the idea of respect and high honor for Mary was not rejected by the first Protestants ; but , they came to criticize the Roman Catholics for venerating Mary . Following the Council of Trent in the 16th century , as Marian veneration became associated with Catholics , Protestant interest in Mary decreased . During the Age of the Enlightenment any residual interest in Mary within Protestant churches almost disappeared , although Anglicans and Lutherans continued to honor her .
The Bibliothèque nationale de France ( BnF ) operates public libraries in Paris , among them the François Mitterrand Library , Richelieu Library , Louvois , Opéra Library , and Arsenal Library . There are three public libraries in the 4th arrondissement . The Forney Library , in the Marais district , is dedicated to the decorative arts ; the Arsenal Library occupies a former military building , and has a large collection on French literature ; and the Bibliothèque historique de la ville de Paris , also in Le Marais , contains the Paris historical research service . The Sainte-Geneviève Library is in 5th arrondissement ; designed by Henri Labrouste and built in the mid-1800s , it contains a rare book and manuscript division . Bibliothèque Mazarine , in the 6th arrondissement , is the oldest public library in France . The Médiathèque Musicale Mahler in the 8th arrondissement opened in 1986 and contains collections related to music . The François Mitterrand Library ( nicknamed Très Grande Bibliothèque ) in the 13th arrondissement was completed in 1994 to a design of Dominique Perrault and contains four glass towers .
For any prime number p , there is also the multiplicative group of integers modulo p. Its elements are the integers 1 to p − 1 . The group operation is multiplication modulo p. That is , the usual product is divided by p and the remainder of this division is the result of modular multiplication . For example , if p = 5 , there are four group elements 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . In this group , 4 · 4 = 1 , because the usual product 16 is equivalent to 1 , which divided by 5 yields a remainder of 1. for 5 divides 16 − 1 = 15 , denoted
The Xiongnu , a nomadic steppe confederation , defeated the Han in 200 BC and forced the Han to submit as a de facto inferior partner , but continued their raids on the Han borders . Emperor Wu of Han ( r. 141–87 BC ) launched several military campaigns against them . The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries . These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia , divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations , and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road , which reached as far as the Mediterranean world . The territories north of Han 's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation . Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south , annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC , and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC .
Tanzania : Dar es Salaam was the torch 's only stop in Africa , on April 13 . The relay began at the grand terminal of the TAZARA Railway , which was China 's largest foreign aid project of the 1970s , and continued for 5 km through the old city to the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium in Temeke , which was built with Chinese aid in 2005 . The torch was lit by Vice-President Ali Mohamed Shein . About a thousand people followed the relay , waving the Olympic flag . The only noted instance of protest was Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai 's withdrawal from the list of torchbearers , in protest against human rights abuses in Tibet .
John spent much of 1205 securing England against a potential French invasion . As an emergency measure , John recreated a version of Henry II 's Assize of Arms of 1181 , with each shire creating a structure to mobilise local levies . When the threat of invasion faded , John formed a large military force in England intended for Poitou , and a large fleet with soldiers under his own command intended for Normandy . To achieve this , John reformed the English feudal contribution to his campaigns , creating a more flexible system under which only one knight in ten would actually be mobilised , but would be financially supported by the other nine ; knights would serve for an indefinite period . John built up a strong team of engineers for siege warfare and a substantial force of professional crossbowmen . The king was supported by a team of leading barons with military expertise , including William Longespée , William the Marshal , Roger de Lacy and , until he fell from favour , the marcher lord William de Braose .
The University of Kansas ( KU ) is a public research university and the largest in the U.S. state of Kansas . KU branch campuses are located in the towns of Lawrence , Wichita , Overland Park , Salina , and Kansas City , Kansas , with the main campus located in Lawrence on Mount Oread , the highest location in Lawrence . Founded March 21 , 1865 , the university was opened in 1866 , under a charter granted by the Kansas State Legislature in 1864 following enabling legislation passed in 1863 under the Kansas State Constitution , adopted two years after the 1861 admission of the former Kansas Territory as the 34th state into the Union following a very famous bloody internal civil war known as " Bleeding Kansas " during the 1850s .
In 1873 , one of the first papers in modern medicine on the subject tried to explain the pathophysiology of the disease while one in 1872 , concluded that asthma can be cured by rubbing the chest with chloroform liniment . Medical treatment in 1880 , included the use of intravenous doses of a drug called pilocarpin . In 1886 , F.H . Bosworth theorized a connection between asthma and hay fever . Epinephrine was first referred to in the treatment of asthma in 1905 . Oral corticosteroids began to be used for this condition in the 1950s while inhaled corticosteroids and selective short acting beta agonist came into wide use in the 1960s .
Whitehead did not begin his career as a philosopher . In fact , he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education . Early in his life he showed great interest in and respect for philosophy and metaphysics , but it is evident that he considered himself a rank amateur . In one letter to his friend and former student Bertrand Russell , after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive , he wrote : " This further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic , onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter . " Ironically , in later life Whitehead would become one of the 20th century 's foremost metaphysicians .
The name Nigeria was taken from the Niger River running through the country . This name was allegedly coined in the late 19th century by British journalist Flora Shaw , she was inspired by the name of the river , in preference to terms such as " Central Sudan " . The origin of the name " Nigeria " came from the name of the Niger River . The word ( Niger ) is an alteration of the Tuareg name egerew n-igerewen used by inhabitants along the middle reaches of the river around Timbuktu prior to 19th-century European colonialism . Egerew n-igerewen means River of the Rivers .
Highbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak , and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s . The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season , thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators . This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards , so much so that for two seasons , from 1998 to 2000 , Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley , which could house more than 70,000 spectators .
The Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that jñāna ( knowledge ) is a sufficient means to moksha . It suggests that systematic techniques/practice ( personal experimentation ) combined with Samkhya 's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha . Yoga shares several central ideas with Advaita Vedanta , with the difference that Yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while Advaita Vedanta is a form of monistic personalism . Like Advaita Vedanta , the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy states that liberation/freedom in this life is achievable , and this occurs when an individual fully understands and realizes the equivalence of Atman ( soul , self ) and Brahman .
Lee modeled the character of Dill on her childhood friend , Truman Capote , known then as Truman Persons . Just as Dill lived next door to Scout during the summer , Capote lived next door to Lee with his aunts while his mother visited New York City . Like Dill , Capote had an impressive imagination and a gift for fascinating stories . Both Lee and Capote were atypical children : both loved to read . Lee was a scrappy tomboy who was quick to fight , but Capote was ridiculed for his advanced vocabulary and lisp . She and Capote made up and acted out stories they wrote on an old Underwood typewriter Lee 's father gave them . They became good friends when both felt alienated from their peers ; Capote called the two of them " apart people " . In 1960 , Capote and Lee traveled to Kansas together to investigate the multiple murders that were the basis for Capote 's nonfiction novel In Cold Blood .
Despite its relative lexical unity , the two dialectal blocks of Catalan ( Eastern and Western ) show some differences in word choices . Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism . Also , usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element .
According to the Institute of Russian Language of the Russian Academy of Sciences , an optional acute accent ( знак ударения ) may , and sometimes should , be used to mark stress . For example , it is used to distinguish between otherwise identical words , especially when context does not make it obvious : замо́к/за́мок ( lock/castle ) , сто́ящий/стоя́щий ( worthwhile/standing ) , чудно́/чу́дно ( this is odd/this is marvelous ) , молоде́ц/мо́лодец ( attaboy/fine young man ) , узна́ю/узнаю́ ( I shall learn it/I recognize it ) , отреза́ть/отре́зать ( to be cutting/to have cut ) ; to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words , especially personal and family names ( афе́ра , гу́ру , Гарси́я , Оле́ша , Фе́рми ) , and to show which is the stressed word in a sentence ( Ты́ съел печенье ? /Ты съе́л печенье ? /Ты съел пече́нье ? – Was it you who ate the cookie ? /Did you eat the cookie ? /Was it the cookie that you ate ? ) . Stress marks are mandatory in lexical dictionaries and books for children or Russian learners .
Ephesus is a cultic centre of Mary , the site of the first Church dedicated to her and the rumoured place of her death . Ephesus was previously a centre for worship of Artemis a virgin goddess . The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus being regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World The cult of Mary was furthered by Queen Theodora in the 6th Century . According to William E. Phipps , in the book Survivals of Roman Religion " Gordon Laing argues convincingly that the worship of Artemis as both virgin and mother at the grand Ephesian temple contributed to the veneration of Mary . "
Meanwhile , the Industrial Revolution laid open the door for mass production and consumption . Aesthetics became a criterion for the middle class as ornamented products , once within the province of expensive craftsmanship , became cheaper under machine production .
London i/ˈlʌndən/ is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom . Standing on the River Thames in the south eastern part of the island of Great Britain , London has been a major settlement for two millennia . It was founded by the Romans , who named it Londinium . London 's ancient core , the City of London , largely retains its 1.12-square-mile ( 2.9 km2 ) medieval boundaries and in 2011 had a resident population of 7,375 , making it the smallest city in England . Since at least the 19th century , the term London has also referred to the metropolis developed around this core . The bulk of this conurbation forms Greater London , [ note 1 ] a region of England governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly . [ note 2 ] The conurbation also covers two English counties : the small district of the City of London and the county of Greater London . The latter constitutes the vast majority of London , though historically it was split between Middlesex ( a now abolished county ) , Essex , Surrey , Kent and Hertfordshire .
Throughout its prehistory and early history , the region and its vicinity in the Yangtze region was the cradle of unique local civilizations which can be dated back to at least the 15th century BC and coinciding with the later years of the Shang and Zhou dynasties in North China . Sichuan was referred to in ancient Chinese sources as Ba-Shu ( 巴蜀 ) , an abbreviation of the kingdoms of Ba and Shu which existed within the Sichuan Basin . Ba included Chongqing and the land in eastern Sichuan along the Yangtze and some tributary streams , while Shu included today 's Chengdu , its surrounding plain and adjacent territories in western Sichuan .
Significant legislative changes in the status of the szlachta , as defined by Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries , consist of its 1374 exemption from the land tax , a 1425 guarantee against the 'arbitrary arrests and/or seizure of property ' of its members , a 1454 requirement that military forces and new taxes be approved by provincial Sejms , and statutes issued between 1496 and 1611 that prescribed the rights of commoners .
Under the Köppen climate classification , using the 0 °C ( 32 °F ) coldest month ( January ) isotherm , New York City itself experiences a humid subtropical climate ( Cfa ) and is thus the northernmost major city on the North American continent with this categorization . The suburbs to the immediate north and west lie in the transition zone from a humid subtropical ( Cfa ) to a humid continental climate ( Dfa ) . The area averages 234 days with at least some sunshine annually , and averages 57 % of possible sunshine annually , accumulating 2,535 hours of sunshine per annum . The city falls under USDA 7b Plant Hardiness zone .
By 1640 , the town 's theocratic government and nine-square grid plan were in place , and the town was renamed Newhaven from Quinnipiac . However , the area north of New Haven remained Quinnipiac until 1678 , when it was renamed Hamden . The settlement became the headquarters of the New Haven Colony . At the time , the New Haven Colony was separate from the Connecticut Colony , which had been established to the north centering on Hartford . One of the principal differences between the two colonies was that the New Haven colony was an intolerant theocracy that did not permit other churches to be established , while the Connecticut colony permitted the establishment of other churches .
In 1902 , the Siemens company developed a tantalum lamp filament . These lamps were more efficient than even graphitized carbon filaments and could operate at higher temperatures . Since tantalum metal has a lower resistivity than carbon , the tantalum lamp filament was quite long and required multiple internal supports . The metal filament had the property of gradually shortening in use ; the filaments were installed with large loops that tightened in use . This made lamps in use for several hundred hours quite fragile . Metal filaments had the property of breaking and re-welding , though this would usually decrease resistance and shorten the life of the filament . General Electric bought the rights to use tantalum filaments and produced them in the US until 1913 .
In 1977 , Elizabeth marked the Silver Jubilee of her accession . Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth , many coinciding with her associated national and Commonwealth tours . The celebrations re-affirmed the Queen 's popularity , despite virtually coincident negative press coverage of Princess Margaret 's separation from her husband . In 1978 , the Queen endured a state visit to the United Kingdom by Romania 's communist dictator , Nicolae Ceaușescu , and his wife , Elena , though privately she thought they had " blood on their hands " . The following year brought two blows : one was the unmasking of Anthony Blunt , former Surveyor of the Queen 's Pictures , as a communist spy ; the other was the assassination of her relative and in-law Lord Mountbatten by the Provisional Irish Republican Army .
During the period of North–South division , Nanjing remained the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries . During this time , Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia . Based on historical documents , the city had 280,000 registered households . Assuming an average Nanjing household had about 5.1 people at that time , the city had more than 1.4 million residents .
Unlike most other cities , Strasbourg 's collections of European art are divided into several museums according not only to type and area , but also to epoch . Old master paintings from the Germanic Rhenish territories and until 1681 are displayed in the Musée de l'Œuvre Notre-Dame , old master paintings from all the rest of Europe ( including the Dutch Rhenish territories ) and until 1871 as well as old master paintings from the Germanic Rhenish territories between 1681 and 1871 are displayed in the Musée des Beaux-Arts . Old master graphic arts until 1871 is displayed in the Cabinet des estampes et dessins . Decorative arts until 1681 ( " German period " ) are displayed in the Musée de l'Œuvre Notre-Dame , decorative arts from 1681 to 1871 ( " French period " ) are displayed in the Musée des Arts décoratifs . International art ( painting , sculpture , graphic arts ) and decorative art since 1871 is displayed in the Musée d'art moderne et contemporain . The latter museum also displays the city 's photographic library .
The first documented visit by a European was in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano , a Florentine explorer in the service of the French crown , who sailed his ship La Dauphine into New York Harbor . He claimed the area for France and named it " Nouvelle Angoulême " ( New Angoulême ) .
Beyoncé has received numerous awards . As a solo artist she has sold over 15 million albums in the US , and over 118 million records worldwide ( a further 60 million additionally with Destiny 's Child ) , making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time . The Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) listed Beyoncé as the top certified artist of the 2000s , with a total of 64 certifications . Her songs " Crazy in Love " , " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) " , " Halo " , and " Irreplaceable " are some of the best-selling singles of all time worldwide . In 2009 , The Observer named her the Artist of the Decade and Billboard named her the Top Female Artist and Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade . In 2010 , Billboard named her in their " Top 50 R & B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years " list at number 15 . In 2012 VH1 ranked her third on their list of the " 100 Greatest Women in Music " . Beyoncé was the first female artist to be honored with the International Artist Award at the American Music Awards . She has also received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards and the Billboard Millennium Award at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards .
The city is bisected geographically and culturally by the North Canadian River , which basically divides North Oklahoma City and South Oklahoma City . The two halves of the city were actually founded and plotted as separate cities , but soon grew together . The north side is characterized by very diverse and fashionable urban neighborhoods near the city center and sprawling suburbs further north . South Oklahoma City is generally more blue collar working class and significantly more industrial , having grown up around the Stockyards and meat packing plants at the turn of the century , and is currently the center of the city 's rapidly growing Latino community .
After they each performed , both were deemed equal until Apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time . As Apollo played the lyre , this was easy to do . Marsyas could not do this , as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time . Apollo was declared the winner because of this . Apollo flayed Marsyas alive in a cave near Celaenae in Phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god . He then nailed Marsyas ' shaggy skin to a nearby pine-tree . Marsyas ' blood turned into the river Marsyas .
The Bithynians were a Thracian people living in northwest Anatolia . After Alexander 's conquests the region of Bithynia came under the rule of the native king Bas , who defeated Calas , a general of Alexander the Great , and maintained the independence of Bithynia . His son , Zipoetes I of Bithynia maintained this autonomy against Lysimachus and Seleucus I , and assumed the title of king ( basileus ) in 297 BCE . His son and successor , Nicomedes I , founded Nicomedia , which soon rose to great prosperity , and during his long reign ( c. 278 – c. 255 BCE ) , as well as those of his successors , the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia . Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries , and they later turned on his son Prusias I , who defeated them in battle . Their last king , Nicomedes IV , was unable to maintain himself against Mithridates VI of Pontus , and , after being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate , he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the Roman republic ( 74 BCE ) .
In the second half of the 20th Century a modern movement in Nichiren Buddhism : Soka Gakkai ( Value Creation Society ) emerged in Japan and spread further to other countries . Soka Gakkai International ( SGI ) is a lay Buddhist movement linking more than 12 million people around the world , and is currently described as " the most diverse " and " the largest lay Buddhist movement in the world " .

In 1579 the northern seven provinces signed the Union of Utrecht , in which they decided to join forces against Spanish rule . The Union of Utrecht is seen as the beginning of the Dutch Republic . In 1580 the new and predominantly Protestant state abolished the bishoprics , including the archbishopric of Utrecht . The stadtholders disapproved of the independent course of the Utrecht bourgeoisie and brought the city under much more direct control of the republic ; which shifted the power towards its dominant province Holland . This was the start of a long period of stagnation of trade and development in Utrecht . Utrecht remained an atypical city in the new republic with about 40 % Catholic in the mid-17th century , and even more among the elite groups , who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there .
On December 15 , 2012 , several news outlets reported that President Barack Obama would nominate Kerry to succeed Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State , after Susan Rice , widely seen as Obama 's preferred choice , withdrew her name from consideration citing a politicized confirmation process following criticism of her response to the 2012 Benghazi attack . On December 21 , Obama proposed the nomination which received positive commentary . His confirmation hearing took place on January 24 , 2013 , before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , the same panel where he first testified in 1971 . The committee unanimously voted to approve him on January 29 , 2013 , and the same day the full Senate confirmed him on a vote of 94–3 . In a letter to Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick , Kerry announced his resignation from the Senate effective February 1 .
From 1877 to 1878 , the area suffered a rash of stagecoach robberies . Most notable , however , were the two holdups committed by masked road-agent William Whitney Brazelton . Brazelton held up two stages in the summer of 1878 near Point of Mountain Station approximately 17 mi ( 27 km ) northwest of Tucson . John Clum , of Tombstone , Arizona fame was one of the passengers . Brazelton was eventually tracked down and killed on Monday August 19 , 1878 , in a mesquite bosque along the Santa Cruz River 3 miles ( 5 km ) south of Tucson by Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell and his citizen 's posse . Brazelton had been suspected of highway robbery not only in the Tucson area , but also in the Prescott region and Silver City , New Mexico area as well . Brazelton 's crimes prompted John J. Valentine , Sr. of Wells , Fargo & Co. to send special agent and future Pima County sheriff Bob Paul to investigate . Fort Lowell , then east of Tucson , was established to help protect settlers from Apache attacks . In 1882 , Frank Stilwell was implicated in the murder of Morgan Earp by Cowboy Pete Spence 's wife , Marietta , at the coroner 's inquest on Morgan Earp 's shooting . The coroner 's jury concluded that Spence , Stilwell , Frederick Bode , and Florentino " Indian Charlie " Cruz were the prime suspects in the assassination of Morgan Earp . :250 Deputy U.S . Marshal Wyatt Earp gathered a few trusted friends and accompanied Virgil Earp and his family as they traveled to Benson for a train ride to California . They found Stilwell lying in wait for Virgil in the Tucson station and killed him on the tracks . After killing Stilwell , Wyatt deputized others and rode on a vendetta , killing three more cowboys over the next few days before leaving the state .
Much of the study in the madrasah college centred on examining whether certain opinions of law were orthodox . This scholarly process of " determining orthodoxy began with a question which the Muslim layman , called in that capacity mustaftī , presented to a jurisconsult , called mufti , soliciting from him a response , called fatwa , a legal opinion ( the religious law of Islam covers civil as well as religious matters ) . The mufti ( professor of legal opinions ) took this question , studied it , researched it intensively in the sacred scriptures , in order to find a solution to it . This process of scholarly research was called ijtihād , literally , the exertion of one 's efforts to the utmost limit . "
Left-wing politics have been particularly strong in municipal government since the 1960s . Voters approved charter amendments that have lessened the penalties for possession of marijuana ( 1974 ) , and that aim to protect access to abortion in the city should it ever become illegal in the State of Michigan ( 1990 ) . In 1974 , Kathy Kozachenko 's victory in an Ann Arbor city-council race made her the country 's first openly homosexual candidate to win public office . In 1975 , Ann Arbor became the first U.S. city to use instant-runoff voting for a mayoral race . Adopted through a ballot initiative sponsored by the local Human Rights Party , which feared a splintering of the liberal vote , the process was repealed in 1976 after use in only one election . As of August 2009 , Democrats hold the mayorship and all council seats . The left tilt of politics in the city has earned it the nickname " The People 's Republic of Ann Arbor " . Nationally , Ann Arbor is located in Michigan 's 12th congressional district , represented by Democrat Debbie Dingell .
In the 2000 presidential election , Vice President Al Gore , a former Democratic U.S . Senator from Tennessee , failed to carry his home state , an unusual occurrence but indicative of strengthening Republican support . Republican George W. Bush received increased support in 2004 , with his margin of victory in the state increasing from 4 % in 2000 to 14 % in 2004 . Democratic presidential nominees from Southern states ( such as Lyndon B. Johnson , Jimmy Carter , Bill Clinton ) usually fare better than their Northern counterparts do in Tennessee , especially among split-ticket voters outside the metropolitan areas .
The popular sports in Tuvalu include kilikiti , Ano , football , futsal , volleyball , handball , basketball and rugby union . Tuvalu has sports organisations for athletics , badminton , tennis , table tennis , volleyball , football , basketball , rugby union , weightlifting and powerlifting . At the 2013 Pacific Mini Games , Tuau Lapua Lapua won Tuvalu 's first gold medal in an international competition in the weightlifting 62 kilogram male snatch . ( He also won bronze in the clean and jerk , and obtained the silver medal overall for the combined event . ) In 2015 Telupe Iosefa received the first gold medal won by Tuvalu at the Pacific Games in the powerlifting 120 kg male division .
The army employs various individual weapons to provide light firepower at short ranges . The most common weapons used by the army are the compact variant of the M16 rifle , the M4 carbine , as well as the 7.62×51mm variant of the FN SCAR for Army Rangers . The primary sidearm in the U.S. Army is the 9 mm M9 pistol ; the M11 pistol is also used . Both handguns are to be replaced through the Modular Handgun System program . Soldiers are also equiped with various hand grenades , such as the M67 fragmentation grenade and M18 smoke grenade .
In the 11th century , a turbulent period occurred in the history of Maritime Southeast Asia . The Indian Chola navy crossed the ocean and attacked the Srivijaya kingdom of Sangrama Vijayatungavarman in Kadaram ( Kedah ) , the capital of the powerful maritime kingdom was sacked and the king was taken captive . Along with Kadaram , Pannai in present-day Sumatra and Malaiyur and the Malayan peninsula were attacked too . Soon after that , the king of Kedah Phra Ong Mahawangsa became the first ruler to abandon the traditional Hindu faith , and converted to Islam with the Sultanate of Kedah established in year 1136 . Samudera Pasai converted to Islam in the year 1267 , the King of Malacca Parameswara married the princess of Pasai , and the son became the first sultan of Malacca . Soon , Malacca became the center of Islamic study and maritime trade , and other rulers followed suit . Indonesian religious leader and Islamic scholar Hamka ( 1908–1981 ) wrote in 1961 : " The development of Islam in Indonesia and Malaya is intimately related to a Chinese Muslim , Admiral Zheng He . "
In the 2001 census Southampton and Portsmouth were recorded as being parts of separate urban areas , however by the time of the 2011 census they had merged to become the sixth largest built-up area in England with a population of 855,569 . This built-up area is part of the metropolitan area known as South Hampshire , which is also known as Solent City , particularly in the media when discussing local governance organisational changes . With a population of over 1.5 million this makes the region one of the United Kingdom 's most populous metropolitan areas .
Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations , both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae . With low frequencies , the stylus must swing a long way from side to side , requiring the groove to be wide , taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record . At high frequencies , hiss , pops , and ticks are significant . These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard . During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced , thus reducing the groove width required , and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased . The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal ; this also reduces the high frequency noise . Thus more music will fit on the record , and noise is reduced .
New York City is the most-populous city in the United States , with an estimated record high of 8,491,079 residents as of 2014 , incorporating more immigration into the city than outmigration since the 2010 United States Census . More than twice as many people live in New York City as in the second-most populous U.S. city ( Los Angeles ) , and within a smaller area . New York City gained more residents between April 2010 and July 2014 ( 316,000 ) than any other U.S. city . New York City 's population amounts to about 40 % of New York State 's population and a similar percentage of the New York metropolitan area population .
New Haven was home to one of the important early events in the burgeoning anti-slavery movement when , in 1839 , the trial of mutineering Mende tribesmen being transported as slaves on the Spanish slaveship Amistad was held in New Haven 's United States District Court . There is a statue of Joseph Cinqué , the informal leader of the slaves , beside City Hall . See " Museums " below for more information . Abraham Lincoln delivered a speech on slavery in New Haven in 1860 , shortly before he secured the Republican nomination for President .
In recent years it has become common for many AC stations , particularly soft AC stations , to play primarily or exclusively Christmas music during the Christmas season in November and December . While these tend mostly to be contemporary seasonal recordings by the same few artists featured under the normal format , most stations will also air some vintage holiday tunes from older pop , MOR , and adult standards artists – such as Nat King Cole , Bing Crosby , Dean Martin , The Carpenters , Percy Faith , Johnny Mathis and Andy Williams – many of whom would never be played on these stations during the rest of the year .
Many older buildings in certain areas of Boston are supported by wooden piles driven into the area 's fill ; these piles remain sound if submerged in water , but are subject to dry rot if exposed to air for long periods . Groundwater levels have been dropping , to varying degrees , in many areas of the city , due in part to an increase in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground . A city agency , the Boston Groundwater Trust , coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells . However , Boston 's drinking water supply , from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs to the west , is one of the very few in the country so pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration .
In the early part of the 20th century , Atlantic City went through a radical building boom . Many of the modest boarding houses that dotted the boardwalk were replaced with large hotels . Two of the city 's most distinctive hotels were the Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel and the Traymore Hotel .
While most of mainland Greece and the Aegean islands was under Ottoman control by the end of the 15th century , Cyprus and Crete remained Venetian territory and did not fall to the Ottomans until 1571 and 1670 respectively . The only part of the Greek-speaking world that escaped long-term Ottoman rule was the Ionian Islands , which remained Venetian until their capture by the First French Republic in 1797 , then passed to the United Kingdom in 1809 until their unification with Greece in 1864 .

While full-time work hinders schooling , empirical evidence is varied on the relationship between part-time work and school . Sometimes even part-time work may hinder school attendance or performance . On the other hand , many poor children work for resources to attend school . Children who are not doing well at school sometimes seek more satisfactory experience in work . Good relations with a supervisor at work can provide relief from tensions that children feel at school and home . In the modern world , school education has become so central to society that schoolwork has become the dominant work for most children , often replacing participation in productive work . If school curricula or quality do not provide children with appropriate skills for available jobs or if children do nor have the aptitude for schoolwork , school may impede the learning of skills , such as agriculture , which will become necessary for future livelihood .
The event of the Protestant Reformation and the politics that ensued has been cited as the origins of German identity that arose in response to the spread of a common German language and literature . Early German national culture was developed through literary and religious figures including Martin Luther , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller . The concept of a German nation was developed by German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder . The popularity of German identity arose in the aftermath of the French Revolution .
BYU has been considered by some Latter-day Saints , as well as some university and church leaders , to be " The Lord 's university " . This phrase is used in reference to the school 's mission as an " ambassador " to the world for the LDS Church and thus , for Jesus Christ . In the past , some students and faculty have expressed dissatisfaction with this nickname , stating that it gives students the idea that university authorities are always divinely inspired and never to be contradicted . Leaders of the school , however , acknowledge that the nickname represents more a goal that the university strives for and not its current state of being . Leaders encourage students and faculty to help fulfill the goal by following the teachings of their religion , adhering to the school 's honor code , and serving others with the knowledge they gain while attending .
The Desert National Park in Jaisalmer is spread over an area of 3,162 square kilometres ( 1,221 sq mi ) , is an excellent example of the ecosystem of the Thar Desert and its diverse fauna . Seashells and massive fossilised tree trunks in this park record the geological history of the desert . The region is a haven for migratory and resident birds of the desert . One can see many eagles , harriers , falcons , buzzards , kestrels and vultures . Short-toed eagles ( Circaetus gallicus ) , tawny eagles ( Aquila rapax ) , spotted eagles ( Aquila clanga ) , laggar falcons ( Falco jugger ) and kestrels are the commonest of these .
The Partyja BPF ( Belarusian Popular Front ) was established in 1988 as a political party and cultural movement for democracy and independence , à la the Baltic republics’ popular fronts . The discovery of mass graves in Kurapaty outside Minsk by historian Zianon Pazniak , the Belarusian Popular Front’s first leader , gave additional momentum to the pro-democracy and pro-independence movement in Belarus . It claimed that the NKVD performed secret killings in Kurapaty . Initially the Front had significant visibility because its numerous public actions almost always ended in clashes with the police and the KGB .
Referring to great power relations pre-1960 , Joshua Baron highlights that starting from around the 16th century and the rise of several European great powers , military conflicts and confrontations was the defining characteristic of diplomacy and relations between such powers . " Between 1500 and 1953 , there were 64 wars in which at least one great power was opposed to another , and they averaged little more than five years in length . In approximately a 450-year time frame , on average at least two great powers were fighting one another in each and every year . " Even during the period of Pax Britannica ( or " the British Peace " ) between 1815 and 1914 , war and military confrontations among the great powers was still a frequent occurrence . In fact , Joshua Baron points out that , in terms of militarized conflicts or confrontations , the UK led the way in this period with nineteen such instances against ; Russia ( 8 ) , France ( 5 ) , Germany/Prussia ( 5 ) and Italy ( 1 ) .
Airports are divided into landside and airside areas . Landside areas include parking lots , public transportation train stations and access roads . Airside areas include all areas accessible to aircraft , including runways , taxiways and aprons . Access from landside areas to airside areas is tightly controlled at most airports . Passengers on commercial flights access airside areas through terminals , where they can purchase tickets , clear security check , or claim luggage and board aircraft through gates . The waiting areas which provide passenger access to aircraft are typically called concourses , although this term is often used interchangeably with terminal .
Opposition to the union mounted among some of Syria 's key elements , namely the socioeconomic , political , and military elites . In response to Syria 's worsening economy , which Nasser attributed to its control by the bourgeoisie , in July 1961 , Nasser decreed socialist measures that nationalized wide-ranging sectors of the Syrian economy . He also dismissed Sarraj in September to curb the growing political crisis . Aburish states that Nasser was not fully capable of addressing Syrian problems because they were " foreign to him " . In Egypt , the economic situation was more positive , with a GNP growth of 4.5 percent and a rapid growth of industry . In 1960 , Nasser nationalized the Egyptian press , which had already been cooperating with his government , in order to steer coverage towards the country 's socioeconomic issues and galvanize public support for his socialist measures .
The assumption of the use of a two-beamed cross does not determine the number of nails used in the crucifixion and some theories suggest three nails while others suggest four nails . However , throughout history larger numbers of nails have been hypothesized , at times as high as 14 nails . These variations are also present in the artistic depictions of the crucifixion . In the Western Church , before the Renaissance usually four nails would be depicted , with the feet side by side . After the Renaissance most depictions use three nails , with one foot placed on the other . Nails are almost always depicted in art , although Romans sometimes just tied the victims to the cross . The tradition also carries to Christian emblems , e.g . the Jesuits use three nails under the IHS monogram and a cross to symbolize the crucifixion .
Some of Nasser 's liberal and Islamist critics in Egypt , including the founding members of the New Wafd Party and writer Jamal Badawi , dismissed Nasser 's popular appeal with the Egyptian masses during his presidency as being the product of successful manipulation and demagoguery . Egyptian political scientist Alaa al-Din Desouki blamed the 1952 revolution 's shortcomings on Nasser 's concentration of power , and Egypt 's lack of democracy on Nasser 's political style and his government 's limitations on freedom of expression and political participation .
The first Digimon television series , which began airing on March 7 , 1999 in Japan on Fuji TV and Kids Station and on August 14 , 1999 in the United States on Fox Kids dubbed by Saban Entertainment for the North American English version . Its premise is a group of 7 kids who , while at summer camp , travel to the Digital World , inhabited by creatures known as Digital Monsters , or Digimon , learning they are chosen to be " DigiDestined " ( " Chosen Children " in the Japanese version ) to save both the Digital and Real World from evil . Each Kid was given a Digivice which selected them to be transported to the DigiWorld and was destined to be paired up with a Digimon Partner , such as Tai being paired up with Agumon and Matt with Gabumon . The children are helped by a mysterious man/digimon named Gennai , who helps them via hologram . The Digivices help their Digimon allies to Digivolve into stronger creatures in times of peril . The Digimon usually reached higher forms when their human partners are placed in dangerous situations , such as fighting the evil forces of Devimon , Etemon and Myotismon in their Champion forms . Later , each character discovered a crest that each belonged to a person ; Tai the Crest of Courage , Matt the Crest of Friendship , Sora the Crest of Love , Izzy the Crest of Knowledge , Mimi the Crest of Sincerity , Joe the Crest of Reliability , T.K . the Crest of Hope , and later Kari the Crest of Light which allowed their Digimon to digivolve into their Ultimate forms . The group consisted of seven original characters : Taichi " Tai " Kamiya , Yamato " Matt " Ishida , Sora Takenouchi , Koushiro " Izzy " Izumi , Mimi Tachikawa , Joe Kido , and Takeru " T.K . " Takaishi . Later on in the series , an eighth character was introduced : Hikari " Kari " Kamiya ( who is Taichi 's younger sister ) .
In the 1988–89 school year , 301 students per 10,000 population were in specialized secondary or higher education , a figure slightly lower than the Soviet average . In 1989 some 58 % of Armenians over age fifteen had completed their secondary education , and 14 % had a higher education . In the 1990–91 school year , the estimated 1,307 primary and secondary schools were attended by 608,800 students . Another seventy specialized secondary institutions had 45,900 students , and 68,400 students were enrolled in a total of ten postsecondary institutions that included universities . In addition , 35 % of eligible children attended preschools . In 1992 Armenia 's largest institution of higher learning , Yerevan State University , had eighteen departments , including ones for social sciences , sciences , and law . Its faculty numbered about 1,300 teachers and its student population about 10,000 students . The National Polytechnic University of Armenia is operating since 1933 .
The Red Cross Society of China flew 557 tents and 2,500 quilts valued at 788,000 yuan ( US $ 113,000 ) to Wenchuan County . The Amity Foundation already began relief work in the region and has earmarked US $ 143,000 for disaster relief . The Sichuan Ministry of Civil Affairs said that they have provided 30,000 tents for those left homeless .
The influence of Old Norse certainly helped move English from a synthetic language along the continuum to a more analytic word order , and Old Norse most likely made a greater impact on the English language than any other language . The eagerness of Vikings in the Danelaw to communicate with their southern Anglo-Saxon neighbors produced a friction that led to the erosion of the complicated inflectional word-endings . Simeon Potter notes : “No less far-reaching was the influence of Scandinavian upon the inflexional endings of English in hastening that wearing away and leveling of grammatical forms which gradually spread from north to south . It was , after all , a salutary influence . The gain was greater than the loss . There was a gain in directness , in clarity , and in strength.”
Conversely , DST can adversely affect farmers , parents of young children , and others whose hours are set by the sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice , although some farmers are neutral . One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates , so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable . Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change . Their cows are sensitive to the timing of milking , so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems . Today some farmers ' groups are in favor of DST .
In 1930 Thuringia was one of the free states where the Nazis gained real political power . Wilhelm Frick was appointed Minister of the Interior for the state of Thuringia after the Nazi Party won six delegates to the Thuringia Diet . In this position he removed from the Thuringia police force anyone he suspected of being a republican and replaced them with men who were favourable towards the Nazi Party . He also ensured that whenever an important position came up within Thuringia , he used his power to ensure that a Nazi was given that post .
European cultural ideas and institutions began to follow colonial expansion into other parts of the world . There was also a rise , especially toward the end of the era , of nationalism in music ( echoing , in some cases , political sentiments of the time ) , as composers such as Edvard Grieg , Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov , and Antonín Dvořák echoed traditional music of their homelands in their compositions .
Martin Luther , a German monk , started the German Reformation by posting 95 theses on the castle church of Wittenberg on October 31 , 1517 . The immediate provocation spurring this act was Pope Leo X’s renewal of the indulgence for the building of the new St. Peter 's Basilica in 1514 . Luther was challenged to recant his heresy at the Diet of Worms in 1521 . When he refused , he was placed under the ban of the Empire by Charles V. Receiving the protection of Frederick the Wise , he was then able to translate the Bible into German .
Nanjing is endowed with rich natural resources , which include more than 40 kinds of minerals . Among them , iron and sulfur reserves make up 40 percent of those of Jiangsu province . Its reserves of strontium rank first in East Asia and the South East Asia region . Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources , both from the Yangtze River and groundwater . In addition , it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in Jiangning and Tangquan Hot Spring in Pukou .
The constitution of the Fifth Republic states that French alone is the official language of the Republic . However , Alsatian , along with other regional languages , are recognized by the French government in the official list of languages of France . A 1999 INSEE survey counted 548,000 adult speakers of Alsatian in France , making it the second most-spoken regional language in the country ( after Occitan ) . Like all regional languages in France , however , the transmission of Alsatian is on the decline . While 39 % of the adult population of Alsace speaks Alsatian , only one in four children speaks it , and only one in ten children uses it regularly .
The West Campus is located about one mile ( 1.6 km ) to the west of the Danforth Campus in Clayton , Missouri , and primarily consists of a four-story former department store building housing mostly administrative space . The West Campus building was home to the Clayton branch of the Famous-Barr department store until 1990 , when the University acquired the property and adjacent parking and began a series of renovations . Today , the basement level houses the West Campus Library , the University Archives , the Modern Graphic History Library , and conference space . The ground level still remains a retail space . The upper floors house consolidated capital gifts , portions of alumni and development , and information systems offices from across the Danforth and Medical School campuses . There is also a music rehearsal room on the second floor . The West Campus is also home to the Center for the Application of Information Technologies ( CAIT ) , which provides IT training services .
In September 1695 , Captain Henry Every , an English pirate on board the Fancy , reached the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb , where he teamed up with five other pirate captains to make an attack on the Indian fleet making the annual voyage to Mocha . The Mughal convoy included the treasure-laden Ganj-i-Sawai , reported to be the greatest in the Mughal fleet and the largest ship operational in the Indian Ocean , and its escort , the Fateh Muhammed . They were spotted passing the straits en route to Surat . The pirates gave chase and caught up with Fateh Muhammed some days later , and meeting little resistance , took some £50,000 to £60,000 worth of treasure .
Following a steady decline , beginning in the late 1990s up through the mid-2000s , illicit drug use among adolescents has been on the rise in the U.S. Aside from alcohol , marijuana is the most commonly indulged drug habit during adolescent years . Data collected by the National Institute on Drug Abuse shows that between the years of 2007 and 2011 , marijuana use grew from 5.7 % to 7.2 % among 8th grade students ; among 10th grade students , from 14.2 % to 17.6 % ; and among 12th graders , from 18.8 % to 22.6 % . Additional , recent years have seen a surge in popularity of MDMA ; between 2010 and 2011 , the use of MDMA increased from 1.4 % to 2.3 % among high school seniors . The heightened usage of ecstasy most likely ties in at least to some degree with the rising popularity of rave culture .
Next to sound shifts , there are ample examples of suffix differences . Often simple suffix shifts ( like switching between -the , -ske , -ke , -je , ... ) , sometimes the suffixes even depend on quite specific grammar rules for a certain dialect . Again taking West Flemish as an example . In that language , the words " ja " ( yes ) and " nee " ( no ) are also conjugated to the ( often implicit ) subject of the sentence . These separate grammar rules are a lot more difficult to imitate correctly than simple sound shifts , making it easy to recognise people who did n't grow up in a certain region , even decades after they moved .
Islamic tradition relates that Muhammad received his first revelation in the Cave of Hira during one of his isolated retreats to the mountains . Thereafter , he received revelations over a period of 23 years . According to hadith and Muslim history , after Muhammad immigrated to Medina and formed an independent Muslim community , he ordered many of his companions to recite the Quran and to learn and teach the laws , which were revealed daily . It is related that some of the Quraysh who were taken prisoners at the battle of Badr regained their freedom after they had taught some of the Muslims the simple writing of the time . Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate . As it was initially spoken , the Quran was recorded on tablets , bones , and the wide , flat ends of date palm fronds . Most suras were in use amongst early Muslims since they are mentioned in numerous sayings by both Sunni and Shia sources , relating Muhammad 's use of the Quran as a call to Islam , the making of prayer and the manner of recitation . However , the Quran did not exist in book form at the time of Muhammad 's death in 632 . There is agreement among scholars that Muhammad himself did not write down the revelation .
People with prolonged , frequent , or close contact with people with TB are at particularly high risk of becoming infected , with an estimated 22 % infection rate . A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 ( or more ) other people per year . Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious . The probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon several factors , including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier , the effectiveness of ventilation , the duration of exposure , the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain , the level of immunity in the uninfected person , and others . The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active ( " overt " ) TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens . After about two weeks of effective treatment , subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others . If someone does become infected , it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others .
In the days following the disaster , an international reconnaissance team of engineers was dispatched to the region to make a detailed preliminary survey of damaged buildings . Their findings show a variety of reasons why many constructions failed to withstand the earthquake .
Late in the 19th century , Paris hosted two major international expositions : the 1889 Universal Exposition , was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution and featured the new Eiffel Tower ; and the 1900 Universal Exposition , which gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III , the Grand Palais , the Petit Palais and the first Paris Métro line . Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism ( Émile Zola ) and Symbolism ( Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine ) , and of Impressionism in art ( Courbet , Manet , Monet , Renoir . )
Copper compounds in liquid form are used as a wood preservative , particularly in treating original portion of structures during restoration of damage due to dry rot . Together with zinc , copper wires may be placed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss . [ citation needed ] Textile fibers use copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics , as do ceramic glazes , stained glass and musical instruments . Electroplating commonly uses copper as a base for other metals such as nickel .
There are at least 3,223 named lakes and reservoirs in Montana , including Flathead Lake , the largest natural freshwater lake in the western United States . Other major lakes include Whitefish Lake in the Flathead Valley and Lake McDonald and St. Mary Lake in Glacier National Park . The largest reservoir in the state is Fort Peck Reservoir on the Missouri river , which is contained by the second largest earthen dam and largest hydraulically filled dam in the world . Other major reservoirs include Hungry Horse on the Flathead River ; Lake Koocanusa on the Kootenai River ; Lake Elwell on the Marias River ; Clark Canyon on the Beaverhead River ; Yellowtail on the Bighorn River , Canyon Ferry , Hauser , Holter , Rainbow ; and Black Eagle on the Missouri River .
Some of Chopin 's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles , such as the Revolutionary Étude ( Op . 10 , No . 12 ) , and the Minute Waltz ( Op . 64 , No . 1 ) . However , with the exception of his Funeral March , the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number , leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener ; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others . There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind ; it merely appeared at that time . The Funeral March , the third movement of his Sonata No . 2 ( Op . 35 ) , the one case where he did give a title , was written before the rest of the sonata , but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it .
The artificial intelligence ( AI ) of enemies in Twilight Princess is more advanced than that of enemies in The Wind Waker . Enemies react to defeated companions and to arrows or slingshot pellets that pass by , and can detect Link from a greater distance than was possible in previous games .
LaserDiscs potentially had a much longer lifespan than videocassettes . Because the discs were read optically instead of magnetically , no physical contact needs to be made between the player and the disc , except for the player 's clamp that holds the disc at its center as it is spun and read . As a result , playback would not wear the information-bearing part of the discs , and properly manufactured LDs would theoretically last beyond one 's lifetime . By contrast , a VHS tape held all of its picture and sound information on the tape in a magnetic coating which is in contact with the spinning heads on the head drum , causing progressive wear with each use ( though later in VHS 's lifespan , engineering improvements allowed tapes to be made and played back without contact ) . Also , the tape was thin and delicate , and it was easy for a player mechanism , especially on a low quality or malfunctioning model , to mishandle the tape and damage it by creasing it , frilling ( stretching ) its edges , or even breaking it .
A novelty shop called Au Bon Marché had been founded in Paris in 1838 to sell lace , ribbons , sheets , mattresses , buttons , umbrellas and other assorted goods . It originally had four departments , twelve employees , and a floor space of three hundred meters . The entrepreneur Aristide Boucicaut became a partner in 1852 , and changed the marketing plan , instituting fixed prices and guarantees that allowed exchanges and refunds , advertising , and a much wider variety of merchandise . The annual income of the store increased from 500,000 francs in 1852 to five million in 1860 . In 1869 he built much larger building at 24 rue de Sèvres on the Left Bank , and enlarged the store again in 1872 , with help from the engineering firm of Gustave Eiffel , creator of the Eiffel Tower . The income rose from twenty million francs in 1870 to 72 million at the time of the Boucicaut 's death in 1877 . The floor space had increased from three hundred square meters in 1838 to fifty thousand , and the number of employees had increased from twelve in 1838 to 1788 in 1879 . Boucicaut was famous for his marketing innovations ; a reading room for husbands while their wives shopped ; extensive newspaper advertising ; entertainment for children ; and six million catalogs sent out to customers . By 1880 half the employees were women ; unmarried women employees lived in dormitories on the upper floors .
There are quite a few different dielectrics that can be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on the requirements of the circuit . Some of these dielectrics are polytetrafluoroethylene ( Teflon ) , FR-4 , FR-1 , CEM-1 or CEM-3 . Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are FR-2 ( phenolic cotton paper ) , FR-3 ( cotton paper and epoxy ) , FR-4 ( woven glass and epoxy ) , FR-5 ( woven glass and epoxy ) , FR-6 ( matte glass and polyester ) , G-10 ( woven glass and epoxy ) , CEM-1 ( cotton paper and epoxy ) , CEM-2 ( cotton paper and epoxy ) , CEM-3 ( non-woven glass and epoxy ) , CEM-4 ( woven glass and epoxy ) , CEM-5 ( woven glass and polyester ) . Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with ball grid array ( BGA ) and naked die technologies , and glass fiber offers the best dimensional stability .
As in most of eastern China the ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly Han nationality ( 98.56 percent ) , with 50 other minority nationalities . In 1999 , 77,394 residents belonged to minority nationalities , among which the vast majority ( 64,832 ) were Hui nationalities , contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population . The second and third largest minority groups were Manchu ( 2,311 ) and Zhuang ( 533 ) nationalities . Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District , comprising 9.13 percent of the district 's population .
When the Xbox 360 was released , Microsoft 's online gaming service Xbox Live was shut down for 24 hours and underwent a major upgrade , adding a basic non-subscription service called Xbox Live Silver ( later renamed Xbox Live Free ) to its already established premium subscription-based service ( which was renamed Gold ) . Xbox Live Free is included with all SKUs of the console . It allows users to create a user profile , join on message boards , and access Microsoft 's Xbox Live Arcade and Marketplace and talk to other members . A Live Free account does not generally support multiplayer gaming ; however , some games that have rather limited online functions already , ( such as Viva Piñata ) or games that feature their own subscription service ( e.g . EA Sports games ) can be played with a Free account . Xbox Live also supports voice the latter a feature possible with the Xbox Live Vision .
Universal Primary Education is one of the eight international Millennium Development Goals , towards which progress has been made in the past decade , though barriers still remain . Securing charitable funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem . Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have indicated that the main obstacles to funding for education include conflicting donor priorities , an immature aid architecture , and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue . Additionally , Transparency International has identified corruption in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving Universal Primary Education in Africa . Furthermore , demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected . Indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the ongoing costs involved . There is also economic pressure from some parents , who prefer their children to earn money in the short term rather than work towards the long-term benefits of education . [ citation needed ]
In 1978 , Queen toured the US and Canada , and spent much of 1979 touring in Europe and Japan . They released their first live album , Live Killers , in 1979 ; it went platinum twice in the US . Queen also released the very successful single " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " , a rockabilly inspired song done in the style of Elvis Presley . The song made the top 10 in many countries , topped the Australian ARIA Charts for seven consecutive weeks , and was the band 's first number one single in the United States where it topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks . Having written the song on guitar and played rhythm on the record , Mercury played rhythm guitar while performing the song live , which was the first time he ever played guitar in concert . In December 1979 , Queen played the opening night at the Concert for the People of Kampuchea in London , having accepted a request by the event 's organiser Paul McCartney .
Confederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the Army of Northern Virginia , the Confederacy 's most famous army . The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at Bentonville , which was a futile attempt by Confederate General Joseph Johnston to slow Union General William Tecumseh Sherman 's advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865 . In April 1865 , after losing the Battle of Morrisville , Johnston surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place , in what is today Durham . North Carolina 's port city of Wilmington was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union , in February 1865 , after the Union won the nearby Second Battle of Fort Fisher , its major defense downriver .
With filming completed in Rome , production moved to Mexico City in late March to shoot the film 's opening sequence , with scenes to include the Day of the Dead festival filmed in and around the Zócalo and the Centro Histórico district . The planned scenes required the city square to be closed for filming a sequence involving a fight aboard a Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm Bo 105 helicopter flown by stunt pilot Chuck Aaron , which called for modifications to be made to several buildings to prevent damage . This particular scene in Mexico required 1,500 extras , 10 giant skeletons and 250,000 paper flowers . Reports in the Mexican media added that the film 's second unit would move to Palenque in the state of Chiapas , to film aerial manoeuvres considered too dangerous to shoot in an urban area .
Hong Taiji 's bureaucracy was staffed with many Han Chinese , including many newly surrendered Ming officials . The Manchus ' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments . Hong Taiji 's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects . Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had , those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property . Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623 , Nurhachi , who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong , turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted ; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them , while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen ( in Jilin ) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong . Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen " nation " as full ( if not first-class ) citizens , obligated to provide military service . By 1648 , less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry . This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji 's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under his personal control , it also greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily . Through these and other measures Hong Taiji was able to centralize power unto the office of the Khan , which in the long run prevented the Jurchen federation from fragmenting after his death .
To extend and consolidate the dynasty 's control in Central Asia , the Kangxi Emperor personally led a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia . The Kangxi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan 's invading forces from these regions , which were then incorporated into the empire . Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar–Qing War . In 1683 , Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang , grandson of Koxinga , who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing . Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title " Duke Haicheng " ( 海澄公 ) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing . Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662 , including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan ( 朱弘桓 ) , son of Zhu Yihai , where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning . The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution . Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi 's forces for series of battles over Albazin , the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia . Zheng 's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin . The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China 's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries . After Galdan 's death , his followers , as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism , attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama . Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa , the capital of Tibet , and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing .
In October 2004 , Sarah Forsyth claimed that she had been dismissed unfairly by Eton College and had been bullied by senior staff . She also claimed she was instructed to do some of Prince Harry 's coursework to enable him to pass AS Art . As evidence , Forsyth provided secretly recorded conversations with both Prince Harry and her Head of Department , Ian Burke . An employment tribunal in July 2005 found that she had been unfairly dismissed and criticised Burke for bullying her and for repeatedly changing his story . It also criticised the school for failing to produce its capability procedures and criticised the Head Master for not reviewing the case independently .
Most mutations within genes are neutral , having no effect on the organism 's phenotype ( silent mutations ) . Some mutations do not change the amino acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same amino acid ( synonymous mutations ) . Other mutations can be neutral if they lead to amino acid sequence changes , but the protein still functions similarly with the new amino acid ( e.g . conservative mutations ) . Many mutations , however , are deleterious or even lethal , and are removed from populations by natural selection . Genetic disorders are the result of deleterious mutations and can be due to spontaneous mutation in the affected individual , or can be inherited . Finally , a small fraction of mutations are beneficial , improving the organism 's fitness and are extremely important for evolution , since their directional selection leads to adaptive evolution . :7.6
Antibiotics are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use , and are usually considered safe and most are well tolerated . However , some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse side effects . Side-effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used , the microbial organisms targeted , and the individual patient . Side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis . Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use . Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions , including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis . Common side-effects include diarrhea , resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora , resulting , for example , in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria , such as Clostridium difficile . Antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora , and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus Candida in the vulvo-vaginal area . Additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs , such as elevated risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid . Some scientists have hypothesized that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics alter the host microbiota and this has been associated with chronic disease .
Strasbourg , well known as centre of humanism , has a long history of excellence in higher-education , at the crossroads of French and German intellectual traditions . Although Strasbourg had been annexed by the Kingdom of France in 1683 , it still remained connected to the German-speaking intellectual world throughout the 18th century and the university attracted numerous students from the Holy Roman Empire , including Goethe , Metternich and Montgelas , who studied law in Strasbourg , among the most prominent . Nowadays , Strasbourg is known to offer among the best university courses in France , after Paris .
Brood parasitism , in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual 's brood , is more common among birds than any other type of organism . After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird 's nest , they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host 's own brood . Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites , which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young , or non-obligate brood parasites , which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young . One hundred bird species , including honeyguides , icterids , and ducks , are obligate parasites , though the most famous are the cuckoos . Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host 's young , which allows them to destroy the host 's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host 's chicks ; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks .
New Delhi is particularly renowned for its beautifully landscaped gardens that can look quite stunning in spring . The largest of these include Buddha Jayanti Park and the historic Lodi Gardens . In addition , there are the gardens in the Presidential Estate , the gardens along the Rajpath and India Gate , the gardens along Shanti Path , the Rose Garden , Nehru Park and the Railway Garden in Chanakya Puri . Also of note is the garden adjacent to the Jangpura Metro Station near the Defence Colony Flyover , as are the roundabout and neighbourhood gardens throughout the city .
The governments in Berlin , Bremen and Hamburg are designated by the term Senate . In the three free states of Bavaria , Saxony , and Thuringia the government is referred to as the State Government ( Staatsregierung ) , and in the other ten states the term Land Government ( Landesregierung ) is used . Before January 1 , 2000 , Bavaria had a bicameral parliament , with a popularly elected Landtag , and a Senate made up of representatives of the state 's major social and economic groups . The Senate was abolished following a referendum in 1998 . The states of Berlin , Bremen , and Hamburg are governed slightly differently from the other states . In each of those cities , the executive branch consists of a Senate of approximately eight , selected by the state 's parliament ; the senators carry out duties equivalent to those of the ministers in the larger states . The equivalent of the Minister-President is the Senatspräsident ( President of the Senate ) in Bremen , the Erster Bürgermeister ( First Mayor ) in Hamburg , and the Regierender Bürgermeister ( Governing Mayor ) in Berlin . The parliament for Berlin is called the Abgeordnetenhaus ( House of Representatives ) , while Bremen and Hamburg both have a Bürgerschaft . The parliaments in the remaining 13 states are referred to as Landtag ( State Parliament ) .
Only a few contemporary societies are classified as hunter-gatherers , and many supplement their foraging activity with horticulture and/or keeping animals .
In 2005 two city council members , Ralph Inzunza and Deputy Mayor Michael Zucchet – who briefly took over as acting mayor when Murphy resigned – were convicted of extortion , wire fraud , and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for taking campaign contributions from a strip club owner and his associates , allegedly in exchange for trying to repeal the city 's " no touch " laws at strip clubs . Both subsequently resigned . Inzunza was sentenced to 21 months in prison . In 2009 , a judge acquitted Zucchet on seven out of the nine counts against him , and granted his petition for a new trial on the other two charges ; the remaining charges were eventually dropped .
Murdoch found he had such a rapport with Larry Lamb over lunch that other potential recruits as editor were not interviewed and Lamb was appointed as the first editor of the new Sun . He was scathing in his opinion of the Mirror , where he had recently been employed as a senior sub-editor , and shared Murdoch 's view that a paper 's quality was best measured by its sales , and he regarded the Mirror as overstaffed , and primarily aimed at an ageing readership . Lamb hastily recruited a staff of about 125 reporters , who were mostly selected for their availability rather than their ability .
When the Emancipation Proclamation was announced , Tennessee was mostly held by Union forces . Thus , Tennessee was not among the states enumerated in the Proclamation , and the Proclamation did not free any slaves there . Nonetheless , enslaved African Americans escaped to Union lines to gain freedom without waiting for official action . Old and young , men , women and children camped near Union troops . Thousands of former slaves ended up fighting on the Union side , nearly 200,000 in total across the South .
The Soviets also helped Germany to avoid British naval blockades by providing a submarine base , Basis Nord , in the northern Soviet Union near Murmansk . This also provided a refueling and maintenance location , and a takeoff point for raids and attacks on shipping . In addition , the Soviets provided Germany with access to the Northern Sea Route for both cargo ships and raiders ( though only the commerce raider Komet used the route before the German invasion ) , which forced Britain to protect sea lanes in both the Atlantic and the Pacific .
The revolutionary army established large-scale public works programs and successfully implemented an urban and rural literacy campaign , which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate . In addition to a nationalization program of industry and land , the new regime 's foreign policy placed an emphasis on Somalia 's traditional and religious links with the Arab world , eventually joining the Arab League ( AL ) in 1974 . That same year , Barre also served as chairman of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) , the predecessor of the African Union ( AU ) .
On March 18 , 1965 , about a week before the first American piloted Project Gemini space flight , the USSR accelerated the competition , by launching the two-cosmonaut Voskhod 2 mission with Pavel Belyayev and Alexey Leonov . Voskhod 2 's design modifications included the addition of an inflatable airlock to allow for extravehicular activity ( EVA ) , also known as a spacewalk , while keeping the cabin pressurized so that the capsule 's electronics would n't overheat . Leonov performed the first-ever EVA as part of the mission . A fatality was narrowly avoided when Leonov 's spacesuit expanded in the vacuum of space , preventing him from re-entering the airlock . In order to overcome this , he had to partially depressurize his spacesuit to a potentially dangerous level . He succeeded in safely re-entering the ship , but he and Belyayev faced further challenges when the spacecraft 's atmospheric controls flooded the cabin with 45 % pure oxygen , which had to be lowered to acceptable levels before re-entry . The reentry involved two more challenges : an improperly timed retrorocket firing caused the Voskhod 2 to land 386 kilometers ( 240 mi ) off its designated target area , the town of Perm ; and the instrument compartment 's failure to detach from the descent apparatus caused the spacecraft to become unstable during reentry .
Buddhism provides many opportunities for comparative study with a diverse range of subjects . For example , Buddhism 's emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various differing beliefs , customs and institutions in countries where it has resided throughout its history . Also , its moral and spiritual parallels with other systems of thought—for example , with various tenets of Christianity—have been subjects of close study . In addition , the Buddhist concept of dependent origination has been compared to modern scientific thought , as well as Western metaphysics .
Following his triumph , Napoleon imposed the first elements of the Continental System through the Berlin Decree issued in November 1806 . The Continental System , which prohibited European nations from trading with Britain , was widely violated throughout his reign . In the next few months , Napoleon marched against the advancing Russian armies through Poland and was involved in the bloody stalemate at the Battle of Eylau in February 1807 . After a period of rest and consolidation on both sides , the war restarted in June with an initial struggle at Heilsberg that proved indecisive . On 14 June , however , Napoleon finally obtained an overwhelming victory over the Russians at the Battle of Friedland , wiping out the majority of the Russian army in a very bloody struggle . The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French . On 19 June , Czar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon . The latter assured the envoy that the Vistula River represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe . On that basis , the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of Tilsit after meeting on an iconic raft on the River Niemen . The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated : " I hate the English as much as you do . "
The Human Development Report for 2007/2008 was launched in Brasília , Brazil , on November 27 , 2007 . Its focus was on " Fighting climate change : Human solidarity in a divided world . " Most of the data used for the report are derived largely from 2005 or earlier , thus indicating an HDI for 2005 . Not all UN member states choose to or are able to provide the necessary statistics .
In paintings , Mary is traditionally portrayed in blue . This tradition can trace its origin to the Byzantine Empire , from c.500 AD , where blue was " the colour of an empress " . A more practical explanation for the use of this colour is that in Medieval and Renaissance Europe , the blue pigment was derived from the rock lapis lazuli , a stone imported from Afghanistan of greater value than gold . Beyond a painter 's retainer , patrons were expected to purchase any gold or lapis lazuli to be used in the painting . Hence , it was an expression of devotion and glorification to swathe the Virgin in gowns of blue .
There are numerous community and international newspapers locally that cater to the city 's ethnic mosaic ; such as The Black Chronicle , headquartered in the Eastside , the OK VIETIMES and Oklahoma Chinese Times , located in Asia District , and various Hispanic community publications . The Campus is the student newspaper at Oklahoma City University . Gay publications include The Gayly Oklahoman .
BBC Television is a service of the British Broadcasting Corporation . The corporation , which has operated in the United Kingdom under the terms of a Royal charter since 1927 , has produced television programmes from its own since 1932 , although the start of its regular service of television broadcasts is dated to 2 November 1936 .
The other Ancient Greek dialects , Ionic , Doric , Aeolic , and Arcadocypriot , likely had the same three-way distinction at one point , but Doric seems to have had a fricative in place of /tʰ/ in the Classical period , and the Ionic and Aeolic dialects sometimes lost aspiration ( psilosis ) .
Irir Samaale , the oldest common ancestor of several Somali clans , is generally regarded as the source of the ethnonym Somali . The name " Somali " is , in turn , held to be derived from the words soo and maal , which together mean " go and milk " — a reference to the ubiquitous pastoralism of the Somali people . Another plausible etymology proposes that the term Somali is derived from the Arabic for " wealthy " ( dhawamaal ) , again referring to Somali riches in livestock .
Beginning in April 1985 , Madonna embarked on her first concert tour in North America , The Virgin Tour , with the Beastie Boys as her opening act . She progressed from playing CBGB and the Mudd Club to playing large sporting arenas . At that time she released two more hit singles from the album , " Angel " and " Dress You Up " . In July , Penthouse and Playboy magazines published a number of nude photos of Madonna , taken in New York in 1978 . She had posed for the photographs as she needed money at the time , and was paid as little as $ 25 a session . The publication of the photos caused a media uproar , but Madonna remained " unapologetic and defiant " . The photographs were ultimately sold for up to $ 100,000 . She referred to these events at the 1985 outdoor Live Aid charity concert , saying that she would not take her jacket off because " [ the media ] might hold it against me ten years from now . "
Kim Philby , a Soviet double agent , was a correspondent for the newspaper in Spain during the Spanish Civil War of the late 1930s . Philby was admired for his courage in obtaining high-quality reporting from the front lines of the bloody conflict . He later joined MI6 during World War II , was promoted into senior positions after the war ended , then eventually defected to the Soviet Union in 1963 .
The distinctive characteristic of Italian Gothic is the use of polychrome decoration , both externally as marble veneer on the brick façade and also internally where the arches are often made of alternating black and white segments , and where the columns may be painted red , the walls decorated with frescoes and the apse with mosaic . The plan is usually regular and symmetrical , Italian cathedrals have few and widely spaced columns . The proportions are generally mathematically equilibrated , based on the square and the concept of " armonìa " , and except in Venice where they loved flamboyant arches , the arches are almost always equilateral . Colours and moldings define the architectural units rather than blending them . Italian cathedral façades are often polychrome and may include mosaics in the lunettes over the doors . The façades have projecting open porches and occular or wheel windows rather than roses , and do not usually have a tower . The crossing is usually surmounted by a dome . There is often a free-standing tower and baptistry . The eastern end usually has an apse of comparatively low projection . The windows are not as large as in northern Europe and , although stained glass windows are often found , the favourite narrative medium for the interior is the fresco .
The High Middle Ages was a period of tremendous expansion of population . The estimated population of Europe grew from 35 to 80 million between 1000 and 1347 , although the exact causes remain unclear : improved agricultural techniques , the decline of slaveholding , a more clement climate and the lack of invasion have all been suggested . As much as 90 per cent of the European population remained rural peasants . Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities , usually known as manors or villages . These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services , in a system known as manorialism . There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond , with more of them in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north . The practice of assarting , or bringing new lands into production by offering incentives to the peasants who settled them , also contributed to the expansion of population .
The Germans developed massive reinforced concrete blockhouses , some more than six stories high , which were known as Hochbunker " High Bunkers " or " Flaktürme " flak towers , on which they placed anti-aircraft artillery . Those in cities attacked by the Allied land forces became fortresses . Several in Berlin were some of the last buildings to fall to the Soviets during the Battle of Berlin in 1945 . The British built structures such as the Maunsell Forts in the North Sea , the Thames Estuary and other tidal areas upon which they based guns . After the war most were left to rot . Some were outside territorial waters , and had a second life in the 1960s as platforms for pirate radio stations .
The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue to clubs that are relegated from the league in the form of " parachute payments " . Starting with the 2013–14 season , these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons . Though designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues ( the average Premier League team receives £55 million while the average Football League Championship club receives £2 million ) , critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not , leading to the common occurrence of teams " bouncing back " soon after their relegation . For some clubs who have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League , financial problems , including in some cases administration or even liquidation have followed . Further relegations down the footballing ladder have ensued for several clubs unable to cope with the gap .
On the eastern front , progress was very slow . The Russian army was heavily dependent upon its main magazines in Poland , and the Prussian army launched several successful raids against them . One of them , led by general Platen in September resulted in the loss of 2,000 Russians , mostly captured , and the destruction of 5,000 wagons . Deprived of men , the Prussians had to resort to this new sort of warfare , raiding , to delay the advance of their enemies . Nonetheless , at the end of the year , they suffered two critical setbacks . The Russians under Zakhar Chernyshev and Pyotr Rumyantsev stormed Kolberg in Pomerania , while the Austrians captured Schweidnitz . The loss of Kolberg cost Prussia its last port on the Baltic Sea . In Britain , it was speculated that a total Prussian collapse was now imminent .
During the late 1980s and early 1990s , Richmond experienced a spike in overall crime , in particular , the city 's murder rate . The city had 93 murders for the year of 1985 , with a murder rate of 41.9 killings committed per 100,000 residents . Over the next decade , the city saw a major increase in total homicides . In 1990 there were 114 murders , for a murder rate of 56.1 killings per 100,000 residents . There were 120 murders in 1995 , resulting in a murder rate of 59.1 killings per 100,000 residents , one of the highest in the United States .
With too low a bit rate , compression artifacts ( i.e. , sounds that were not present in the original recording ) may be audible in the reproduction . Some audio is hard to compress because of its randomness and sharp attacks . When this type of audio is compressed , artifacts such as ringing or pre-echo are usually heard . A sample of applause compressed with a relatively low bit rate provides a good example of compression artifacts .
A large Russian assault on the allied supply base to the southeast , at Balaclava was rebuffed on 25 October 1854.:521–527 The Battle of Balaclava is remembered in the UK for the actions of two British units . At the start of the battle , a large body of Russian cavalry charged the 93rd Highlanders , who were posted north of the village of Kadikoi . Commanding them was Sir Colin Campbell . Rather than 'form square ' , the traditional method of repelling cavalry , Campbell took the risky decision to have his Highlanders form a single line , two men deep . Campbell had seen the effectiveness of the new Minie rifles , with which his troops were armed , at the Battle of the Alma a month before , and was confident his men could beat back the Russians . His tactics succeeded . From up on the ridge to the west , Times correspondent William Howard Russell saw the Highlanders as a 'thin red streak topped with steel ' , a phrase which soon became the 'Thin Red Line . '
Traditionally , Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona 's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority , in stark contrast to Barça 's revolutionary spirit . Also in the 1960s and 1970s , while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia 's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life , Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen , military officers , civil servants and career fascists .
CDs are susceptible to damage during handling and from environmental exposure . Pits are much closer to the label side of a disc , enabling defects and contaminants on the clear side to be out of focus during playback . Consequently , CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disc . Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing . The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed , allowing gases and liquids to corrode the metal reflective layer and to interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits . The fungus Geotrichum candidum , found in Belize , has been found to consume the polycarbonate plastic and aluminium found in CDs .
The passing of the Antarctic Conservation Act ( 1978 ) in the U.S. brought several restrictions to U.S. activity on Antarctica . The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty , as can the extraction of any indigenous species . The overfishing of krill , which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem , led officials to enact regulations on fishing . The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources ( CCAMLR ) , a treaty that came into force in 1980 , requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem . Despite these new acts , unregulated and illegal fishing , particularly of Patagonian toothfish ( marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S. ) , remains a serious problem . The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing , with estimates of 32,000 tonnes ( 35,300 short tons ) in 2000 .
Beer is the world 's most widely consumed and likely the oldest alcoholic beverage ; it is the third most popular drink overall , after water and tea . The production of beer is called brewing , which involves the fermentation of starches , mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly malted barley , although wheat , maize ( corn ) , and rice are widely used . Most beer is flavoured with hops , which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative , though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included . The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect which is often removed during processing , and replaced with forced carbonation . Some of humanity 's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer : the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours , and " The Hymn to Ninkasi " , a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer , served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people .
Muslim physicians contributed to the field of medicine , including the subjects of anatomy and physiology : such as in the 15th century Persian work by Mansur ibn Muhammad ibn al-Faqih Ilyas entitled Tashrih al-badan ( Anatomy of the body ) which contained comprehensive diagrams of the body 's structural , nervous and circulatory systems ; or in the work of the Egyptian physician Ibn al-Nafis , who proposed the theory of pulmonary circulation . Avicenna 's The Canon of Medicine remained an authoritative medical textbook in Europe until the 18th century . Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi ( also known as Abulcasis ) contributed to the discipline of medical surgery with his Kitab al-Tasrif ( " Book of Concessions " ) , a medical encyclopedia which was later translated to Latin and used in European and Muslim medical schools for centuries . Other medical advancements came in the fields of pharmacology and pharmacy .
The BBC 's highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights , as well as other evenings when fixtures justify , will run until 2016 . Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 have been purchased for £1.782 billion . On 22 June 2009 , due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £30 million payment to the Premier League , ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing a total of 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010–11 to 2012–13 . On 13 June 2012 , the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013–14 through 2015–16 seasons at £246 million-a-year . The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky who paid £760 million-a-year . The total domestic rights have raised £3.018 billion , an increase of 70.2 % over the 2010–11 to 2012–13 rights . The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2 % in 2015 , when Sky and BT paid a total of £5.136 billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018–19 season .
On August 17 , 2007 , Dell Inc. announced that after an internal investigation into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through to the first quarter of 2007 by a total amount of between $ 50 million and $ 150 million , or 2 cents to 7 cents per share . The investigation , begun in November 2006 , resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted . It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer AMD . In 2010 Dell finally paid $ 100 million to settle the SEC 's charges of fraud . Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions , without admitting or denying the charges .
There is evidence of induced copper deficiency in those taking 100–300 mg of zinc daily . A 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo . The USDA RDA is 11 and 8 mg Zn/day for men and women , respectively . Levels of 100–300 mg may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol . Levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals , such as iron and manganese . There is also a condition called the zinc shakes or " zinc chills " that can be induced by the inhalation of freshly formed zinc oxide formed during the welding of galvanized materials . Zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain between 17 and 38 mg of zinc per gram . There have been claims of disability , and even death , due to excessive use of these products .
Experts point out that the earthquake hit an area that has been largely neglected and untouched by China 's economic rise . Health care is poor in inland areas such as Sichuan , highlighting the widening gap between prosperous urban dwellers and struggling rural people . Vice Minister of Health Gao Qiang told reporters in Beijing that the " public health care system in China is insufficient . " The Vice Minister of Health also suggested that the government would pick up the costs of care to earthquake victims , many of whom have little or no insurance : " The government should be responsible for providing medical treatment to them , " he said .
The Polish nobility enjoyed many rights that were not available to the noble classes of other countries and , typically , each new monarch conceded them further privileges . Those privileges became the basis of the Golden Liberty in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth . Despite having a king , Poland was called the nobility 's Commonwealth because the king was elected by all interested members of hereditary nobility and Poland was considered to be the property of this class , not of the king or the ruling dynasty . This state of affairs grew up in part because of the extinction of the male-line descendants of the old royal dynasty ( first the Piasts , then the Jagiellons ) , and the selection by the nobility of the Polish king from among the dynasty 's female-line descendants .
Greece is home to the first advanced civilizations in Europe and is considered the birthplace of Western civilization , [ citation clutter ] beginning with the Cycladic civilization on the islands of the Aegean Sea at around 3200 BC , the Minoan civilization in Crete ( 2700–1500 BC ) , and then the Mycenaean civilization on the mainland ( 1900–1100 BC ) . These civilizations possessed writing , the Minoans writing in an undeciphered script known as Linear A , and the Mycenaeans in Linear B , an early form of Greek . The Mycenaeans gradually absorbed the Minoans , but collapsed violently around 1200 BC , during a time of regional upheaval known as the Bronze Age collapse . This ushered in a period known as the Greek Dark Ages , from which written records are absent .
The site where the Saint Petersburg Passage sprawls had been devoted to trade since the city 's foundation in the early 18th century . It had been occupied by various shops and warehouses ( Maly Gostiny Dvor , Schukin Dvor , Apraksin Dvor ) until 1846 , when Count Essen-Stenbock-Fermor acquired the grounds to build an elite shopping mall for the Russian nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie . Stenbock-Fermor conceived of the Passage as more than a mere shopping mall , but also as a cultural and social centre for the people of St Petersburg . The edifice contained coffee-houses , confectioneries , panorama installations , an anatomical museum , a wax museum , and even a small zoo , described by Dostoyevsky in his extravaganza " Crocodile , or Passage through the Passage " . The concert hall became renowned as a setting for literary readings attended by the likes of Dostoevsky and Turgenev . Parenthetically , the Passage premises have long been associated with the entertainment industry and still remains home to the Komissarzhevskaya Theatre .
This allowed any English firm to trade with India , unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament , thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years . By an act that was passed in 1698 , a new " parallel " East India Company ( officially titled the English Company Trading to the East Indies ) was floated under a state-backed indemnity of £2 million . The powerful stockholders of the old company quickly subscribed a sum of £315,000 in the new concern , and dominated the new body . The two companies wrestled with each other for some time , both in England and in India , for a dominant share of the trade .
The Raleigh Parks and Recreation Department offers a wide variety of leisure opportunities at more than 150 sites throughout the city , which include : 8,100 acres ( 33 km2 ) of park land , 78 miles ( 126 km ) of greenway , 22 community centers , a BMX championship-caliber race track , 112 tennis courts among 25 locations , 5 public lakes , and 8 public aquatic facilities . The J. C. Raulston Arboretum , an 8-acre ( 32,000 m² ) arboretum and botanical garden in west Raleigh administered by North Carolina State University , maintains a year-round collection that is open daily to the public without charge .
Medieval writers divided history into periods such as the " Six Ages " or the " Four Empires " , and considered their time to be the last before the end of the world . When referring to their own times , they spoke of them as being " modern " . In the 1330s , the humanist and poet Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua ( or " ancient " ) and to the Christian period as nova ( or " new " ) . Leonardo Bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodisation in his History of the Florentine People ( 1442 ) . Bruni and later historians argued that Italy had recovered since Petrarch 's time , and therefore added a third period to Petrarch 's two . The " Middle Ages " first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas or " middle season " . In early usage , there were many variants , including medium aevum , or " middle age " , first recorded in 1604 , and media saecula , or " middle ages " , first recorded in 1625 . The alternative term " medieval " ( or occasionally " mediaeval " ) derives from medium aevum . Tripartite periodisation became standard after the German 17th century historian Christoph Cellarius divided history into three periods : Ancient , Medieval , and Modern .

Notable Greek scientists of modern times include Dimitrios Galanos , Georgios Papanikolaou ( inventor of the Pap test ) , Nicholas Negroponte , Constantin Carathéodory ( known for the Carathéodory theorems and Carathéodory conjecture ) , Manolis Andronikos ( discovered the tomb of Philip II of Macedon in Vergina ) , Michael Dertouzos , John Argyris , Panagiotis Kondylis , John Iliopoulos ( 2007 Dirac Prize for his contributions on the physics of the charm quark , a major contribution to the birth of the Standard Model , the modern theory of Elementary Particles ) , Joseph Sifakis ( 2007 Turing Award , the " Nobel Prize " of Computer Science ) , Christos Papadimitriou ( 2002 Knuth Prize , 2012 Gödel Prize ) , Mihalis Yannakakis ( 2005 Knuth Prize ) , Dimitri Nanopoulos and Helene Ahrweiler .
It has pleased western historians to write of a decline of the Ottoman Empire as though a stable and uncontested polity of that name once existed . The borders did expand and contract but they were always dynamic and always in " question " right from the beginning . The Ottoman Empire was created from the lands of the former eastern Roman Empire on the occasion of the latter 's violent demise . The last Roman emperor died fighting hand-to-hand in the streets of his capital , Constantinople , overwhelmed by the Ottoman military , in May , 1453 . The victors inherited his remaining territory in the Balkans .
Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837 , and a regency was avoided . On 20 June 1837 , William IV died at the age of 71 , and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom . In her diary she wrote , " I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma , who told me the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see me . I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room ( only in my dressing gown ) and alone , and saw them . Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle , the King , was no more , and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning , and consequently that I am Queen . " Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria , but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again .

The Cork College of Commerce is the largest post-Leaving Certificate college in Ireland and is also the biggest provider of Vocational Preparation and Training courses in the country . [ citation needed ] Other 3rd level institutions include Griffith College Cork , a private institution , and various other colleges .
The simplest type of MP3 file uses one bit rate for the entire file : this is known as Constant Bit Rate ( CBR ) encoding . Using a constant bit rate makes encoding simpler and faster . However , it is also possible to create files where the bit rate changes throughout the file . These are known as Variable Bit Rate ( VBR ) files . The idea behind this is that , in any piece of audio , some parts will be much easier to compress , such as silence or music containing only a few instruments , while others will be more difficult to compress . So , the overall quality of the file may be increased by using a lower bit rate for the less complex passages and a higher one for the more complex parts . With some encoders , it is possible to specify a given quality , and the encoder will vary the bit rate accordingly . Users who know a particular " quality setting " that is transparent to their ears can use this value when encoding all of their music , and generally speaking not need to worry about performing personal listening tests on each piece of music to determine the correct bit rate .
The climate in Southeast Asia is mainly tropical–hot and humid all year round with plentiful rainfall . Northern Vietnam and the Myanmar Himalayas are the only regions in Southeast Asia that feature a subtropical climate , which has a cold winter with snow . The majority of Southeast Asia has a wet and dry season caused by seasonal shift in winds or monsoon . The tropical rain belt causes additional rainfall during the monsoon season . The rain forest is the second largest on earth ( with the Amazon being the largest ) . An exception to this type of climate and vegetation is the mountain areas in the northern region , where high altitudes lead to milder temperatures and drier landscape . Other parts fall out of this climate because they are desert like .
Western commentators post-9/11 often perceive madaris as places of radical revivalism with a connotation of anti-Americanism and radical extremism , frequently associated in the Western press with Wahhabi attitudes toward non-Muslims . In Arabic the word madrasa simply means " school " and does not imply a political or religious affiliation , radical or otherwise . Madaris have varied curricula , and are not all religious . Some madaris in India , for example , have a secularised identity . Although early madaris were founded primarily to gain " knowledge of God " they also taught subjects such as mathematics and poetry . For example , in the Ottoman Empire , " Madrasahs had seven categories of sciences that were taught , such as : styles of writing , oral sciences like the Arabic language , grammar , rhetoric , and history and intellectual sciences , such as logic . " This is similar to the Western world , in which universities began as institutions of the Catholic church .
On 26 February 2012 , The Sun on Sunday was launched to replace the closed News of the World , employing some of its former journalists . In late 2013 , it was given a new look , with a new typeface . The average circulation for The Sun on Sunday in March 2014 was 1,686,840 ; but in May 2015 The Mail on Sunday sold more copies for the first time , an average of 28,650 over those of its rival : 1,497,855 to 1,469,195 . Roy Greenslade issued some caveats over the May 2015 figures , but believes the weekday Daily Mail will overtake The Sun in circulation during 2016 .
In 2004 , the first bike lane in the city was added to Orange Street , connecting East Rock Park and the East Rock neighborhood to downtown . Since then , bike lanes have also been added to sections of Howard Ave , Elm St , Dixwell Avenue , Water Street , Clinton Avenue and State Street . The city has created recommended bike routes for getting around New Haven , including use of the Canal Trail and the Orange Street lane . A bike map of the city entire can be seen here , and bike maps broken down by area here . As of the end of 2012 , bicycle lanes have also been added in both directions on Dixwell Avenue along most of the street from downtown to the Hamden town line , as well as along Howard Avenue from Yale New Haven Hospital to City Point .
The main cast was revealed in December 2014 at the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios . Daniel Craig returned for his fourth appearance as James Bond , while Ralph Fiennes , Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw reprised their roles as M , Eve Moneypenny and Q respectively , having been established in Skyfall . Rory Kinnear also reprised his role as Bill Tanner in his third appearance in the series .
Prior to moving its headquarters to Chicago , aerospace manufacturer Boeing ( # 30 ) was the largest company based in Seattle . Its largest division is still headquartered in nearby Renton , and the company has large aircraft manufacturing plants in Everett and Renton , so it remains the largest private employer in the Seattle metropolitan area . Former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels announced a desire to spark a new economic boom driven by the biotechnology industry in 2006 . Major redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood is underway , in an effort to attract new and established biotech companies to the city , joining biotech companies Corixa ( acquired by GlaxoSmithKline ) , Immunex ( now part of Amgen ) , Trubion , and ZymoGenetics . Vulcan Inc. , the holding company of billionaire Paul Allen , is behind most of the development projects in the region . While some see the new development as an economic boon , others have criticized Nickels and the Seattle City Council for pandering to Allen 's interests at taxpayers ' expense . Also in 2006 , Expansion Magazine ranked Seattle among the top 10 metropolitan areas in the nation for climates favorable to business expansion . In 2005 , Forbes ranked Seattle as the most expensive American city for buying a house based on the local income levels . In 2013 , however , the magazine ranked Seattle No . 9 on its list of the Best Places for Business and Careers .
Josip Broz Tito ( Cyrillic : Јосип Броз Тито , pronounced [ jǒsip brôːz tîto ] ; born Josip Broz ; 7 May 1892 [ nb 1 ] – 4 May 1980 ) was a Yugoslav revolutionary and statesman , serving in various roles from 1943 until his death in 1980 . During World War II he was the leader of the Partisans , often regarded as the most effective resistance movement in occupied Europe . While his presidency has been criticized as authoritarian , and concerns about the repression of political opponents have been raised , Tito was " seen by most as a benevolent dictator " due to his economic and diplomatic policies . He was a popular public figure both in Yugoslavia and abroad . Viewed as a unifying symbol , his internal policies maintained the peaceful coexistence of the nations of the Yugoslav federation . He gained further international attention as the chief leader of the Non-Aligned Movement , working with Jawaharlal Nehru of India , Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Sukarno of Indonesia .
Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values . In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar ( symbol ₥ ) , cent or one-hundredth of a dollar ( symbol ¢ ) , dime or one-tenth of a dollar , and eagle or ten dollars , with prescribed weights and composition of gold , silver , or copper for each . It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union , but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $ 50 half union exist . However , only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar ; " dime " is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10¢ , while " eagle " and " mill " are largely unknown to the general public , though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies , and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $ X.XX9 per gallon , e.g. , $ 3.599 , sometimes written as $ 3.599⁄10 . When currently issued in circulating form , denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes ( with the exception of gold , silver and platinum coins valued up to $ 100 as legal tender , but worth far more as bullion ) . Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today , although the note form is significantly more common . In the past , " paper money " was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar ( fractional currency ) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $ 20 ( known as the " double eagle " , discontinued in the 1930s ) . The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars , and subsequently was used in naming gold coins . Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination , known as " fractional currency " , was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as " shinplasters " . In 1854 , James Guthrie , then Secretary of the Treasury , proposed creating $ 100 , $ 50 and $ 25 gold coins , which were referred to as a " Union " , " Half Union " , and " Quarter Union " , thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $ 100 .
Plymouth was granted the dignity of Lord Mayor by King George V in 1935 . The position is elected each year by a group of six councillors . It is traditional that the position of the Lord Mayor alternates between the Conservative Party and the Labour Party annually and that the Lord Mayor chooses the Deputy Lord Mayor . Conservative councillor Dr John Mahony is the incumbent for 2015–16 .
Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis , anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions . Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material , such as the Paleolithic and the Neolithic , of particular use in archaeology . [ citation needed ] Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types , such as Olduwan or Mousterian or Levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past . [ citation needed ] Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to Culture regions as well , since mapping cultures is central to both sciences . By making comparisons across cultural traditions ( time-based ) and cultural regions ( space-based ) , anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method , a central part of their science .
The Qing dynasty ( 1644–1911 ) was founded after the fall of the Ming , the last Han Chinese dynasty , by the Manchus . The Manchus were formerly known as the Jurchens . When Beijing was captured by Li Zicheng 's peasant rebels in 1644 , the Chongzhen Emperor , the last Ming emperor , committed suicide . The Manchus then allied with former Ming general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing , which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty . The Mancus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of China proper . Schoppa , the editor of The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History argues , " A date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is thus closer to what we know today as historical 'reality ' . It also allows us to have a better baseline to understand the precipitous decline of the Chinese polity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . "
Versions of revived Palladian architecture dominated English country house architecture . Houses were increasingly placed in grand landscaped settings , and large houses were generally made wide and relatively shallow , largely to look more impressive from a distance . The height was usually highest in the centre , and the Baroque emphasis on corner pavilions often found on the continent generally avoided . In grand houses , an entrance hall led to steps up to a piano nobile or mezzanine floor where the main reception rooms were . Typically the basement area or " rustic " , with kitchens , offices and service areas , as well as male guests with muddy boots , came some way above ground , and was lit by windows that were high on the inside , but just above ground level outside . A single block was typical , with a perhaps a small court for carriages at the front marked off by railings and a gate , but rarely a stone gatehouse , or side wings around the court .
Robert Plutchik agreed with Ekman 's biologically driven perspective but developed the " wheel of emotions " , suggesting eight primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis : joy versus sadness ; anger versus fear ; trust versus disgust ; and surprise versus anticipation . Some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions . The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions . Alternatively , similar to the way primary colors combine , primary emotions could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience . For example , interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form contempt . Relationships exist between basic emotions , resulting in positive or negative influences .
The British Architectural Library , sometimes referred to as the RIBA Library , was established in 1834 upon the founding of the institute with donations from members . Now , with over four million items , it is one of the three largest architectural libraries in the world and the largest in Europe . Some items from the collections are on permanent display at the Victoria and Albert Museum ( V & A ) in the V & A + RIBA Architecture Gallery and included in temporary exhibitions at the RIBA and across Europe and North America . Its collections include :
The Tuvaluan language and English are the national languages of Tuvalu . Tuvaluan is of the Ellicean group of Polynesian languages , distantly related to all other Polynesian languages such as Hawaiian , Māori , Tahitian , Samoan and Tongan . It is most closely related to the languages spoken on the Polynesian outliers in Micronesia and northern and central Melanesia . The language has borrowed from the Samoan language , as a consequence of Christian missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries being predominantly Samoan .
There is very little voice acting in the game , as is the case in most Zelda titles to date . Link remains silent in conversation , but grunts when attacking or injured and gasps when surprised . His emotions and responses are largely indicated visually by nods and facial expressions . Other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations , including laughter , surprised or fearful exclamations , and screams . The character of Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialog is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech , which was produced by scrambling the phonemes of English phrases [ better source needed ] sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto .
Temporal measurement , chronometry , takes two distinct period forms : the calendar , a mathematical tool for organizing intervals of time , and the clock , a physical mechanism that counts the passage of time . In day-to-day life , the clock is consulted for periods less than a day whereas the calendar is consulted for periods longer than a day . Increasingly , personal electronic devices display both calendars and clocks simultaneously . The number ( as on a clock dial or calendar ) that marks the occurrence of a specified event as to hour or date is obtained by counting from a fiducial epoch—a central reference point .
220th Street is the highest numbered street on Manhattan Island . Marble Hill is also within the borough of Manhattan , so the highest street number in the borough is 228th Street . However , the numbering continues in the Bronx up to 263rd Street . The lowest number is East First Street—which runs in Alphabet City near East Houston Street—as well as First Place in Battery Park City .
Israeli literature is primarily poetry and prose written in Hebrew , as part of the renaissance of Hebrew as a spoken language since the mid-19th century , although a small body of literature is published in other languages , such as English . By law , two copies of all printed matter published in Israel must be deposited in the National Library of Israel at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem . In 2001 , the law was amended to include audio and video recordings , and other non-print media . In 2013 , 91 percent of the 7,863 books transferred to the library were in Hebrew . The Hebrew Book Week is held each June and features book fairs , public readings , and appearances by Israeli authors around the country . During the week , Israel 's top literary award , the Sapir Prize , is presented . [ citation needed ]
Several explanations have been offered for Yale’s representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War . Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s , and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates . Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale’s focus on creating " a laboratory for future leaders , " an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster . Richard H. Brodhead , former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University , stated : " We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions , and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale . " Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes " an ethos of organized activity " at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union 's Liberal Party , George Pataki the Conservative Party , and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News . Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism : " It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school . " CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the " son and grandson of alumni " , and for a " member of a politically influential family . " New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students , faculty , and administration , which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others .
The first BeiDou system , officially called the BeiDou Satellite Navigation Experimental System ( simplified Chinese : 北斗卫星导航试验系统 ; traditional Chinese : 北斗衛星導航試驗系統 ; pinyin : Běidǒu wèixīng dǎoháng shìyàn xìtǒng ) and also known as BeiDou-1 , consists of three satellites and offers limited coverage and applications . It has been offering navigation services , mainly for customers in China and neighboring regions , since 2000 .
The Negritos are believed to be the first inhabitants of Southeast Asia . Once inhabiting Taiwan , Vietnam , and various other parts of Asia , they are now confined primarily to Thailand , the Malay Archipelago , and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . Negrito means " little black people " in Spanish ( negrito is the Spanish diminutive of negro , i.e. , " little black person " ) ; it is what the Spaniards called the short-statured , hunter-gatherer autochthones that they encountered in the Philippines . Despite this , Negritos are never referred to as black today , and doing so would cause offense . The term Negrito itself has come under criticism in countries like Malaysia , where it is now interchangeable with the more acceptable Semang , although this term actually refers to a specific group . The common Thai word for Negritos literally means " frizzy hair " .
Albert spent the first six months of 1913 on the training ship HMS Cumberland in the West Indies and on the east coast of Canada . He was rated as a midshipman aboard HMS Collingwood on 15 September 1913 , and spent three months in the Mediterranean . His fellow officers gave him the nickname " Mr. Johnson " . One year after his commission , he began service in the First World War . He was mentioned in despatches for his action as a turret officer aboard Collingwood in the Battle of Jutland ( 31 May – 1 June 1916 ) , an indecisive engagement with the German navy that was the largest naval action of the war . He did not see further combat , largely because of ill health caused by a duodenal ulcer , for which he had an operation in November 1917 .
In 1661 another Jesuit , Johann Grueber , crossed Tibet from Sining to Lhasa ( where he spent a month ) , before heading on to Nepal . He was followed by others who actually built a church in Lhasa . These included the Jesuit Father Ippolito Desideri , 1716–1721 , who gained a deep knowledge of Tibetan culture , language and Buddhism , and various Capuchins in 1707–1711 , 1716–1733 and 1741–1745 , Christianity was used by some Tibetan monarchs and their courts and the Karmapa sect lamas to counterbalance the influence of the Gelugpa sect in the 17th century until in 1745 when all the missionaries were expelled at the lama 's insistence .
The first PCBs used through-hole technology , mounting electronic components by leads inserted through holes on one side of the board and soldered onto copper traces on the other side . Boards may be single-sided , with an unplated component side , or more compact double-sided boards , with components soldered on both sides . Horizontal installation of through-hole parts with two axial leads ( such as resistors , capacitors , and diodes ) is done by bending the leads 90 degrees in the same direction , inserting the part in the board ( often bending leads located on the back of the board in opposite directions to improve the part 's mechanical strength ) , soldering the leads , and trimming off the ends . Leads may be soldered either manually or by a wave soldering machine .
As of 2007 , the total installed capacity of solar hot water systems is approximately 154 thermal gigawatt ( GWth ) . China is the world leader in their deployment with 70 GWth installed as of 2006 and a long-term goal of 210 GWth by 2020 . Israel and Cyprus are the per capita leaders in the use of solar hot water systems with over 90 % of homes using them . In the United States , Canada and Australia heating swimming pools is the dominant application of solar hot water with an installed capacity of 18 GWth as of 2005 .
The decorations were seldom displayed , however . After the Tito–Stalin split of 1948 and his inauguration as president in 1953 , Tito rarely wore his uniform except when present in a military function , and then ( with rare exception ) only wore his Yugoslav ribbons for obvious practical reasons . The awards were displayed in full number only at his funeral in 1980 . Tito 's reputation as one of the Allied leaders of World War II , along with his diplomatic position as the founder of the Non-Aligned Movement , was primarily the cause of the favorable international recognition .
The earliest writers on sexual orientation usually understood it to be intrinsically linked to the subject 's own sex . For example , it was thought that a typical female-bodied person who is attracted to female-bodied persons would have masculine attributes , and vice versa . This understanding was shared by most of the significant theorists of sexual orientation from the mid nineteenth to early twentieth century , such as Karl Heinrich Ulrichs , Richard von Krafft-Ebing , Magnus Hirschfeld , Havelock Ellis , Carl Jung , and Sigmund Freud , as well as many gender-variant homosexual people themselves . However , this understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was disputed at the time , and , through the second half of the twentieth century , gender identity came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation . Transgender and cisgender people may be attracted to men , women , or both , although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations . An individual homosexual , heterosexual or bisexual person may be masculine , feminine , or androgynous , and in addition , many members and supporters of lesbian and gay communities now see the " gender-conforming heterosexual " and the " gender-nonconforming homosexual " as negative stereotypes . Nevertheless , studies by J. Michael Bailey and Kenneth Zucker found a majority of the gay men and lesbians sampled reporting various degrees of gender-nonconformity during their childhood years .
As an adolescent , he had a particular love of theology and the Scriptures became the foundation of his spirituality . During his studies in Palencia , Spain , he experienced a dreadful famine , prompting Dominic to sell all of his beloved books and other equipment to help his neighbors . After he completed his studies , Bishop Martin Bazan and Prior Diego d'Achebes appointed Dominic to the cathedral chapter and he became a regular canon under the Rule of St. Augustine and the Constitutions for the cathedral church of Osma . At the age of twenty-four or twenty-five , he was ordained to the priesthood .
With crude oil as the country 's primary export , Gaddafi sought to improve Libya 's oil sector . In October 1969 , he proclaimed the current trade terms unfair , benefiting foreign corporations more than the Libyan state , and by threatening to reduce production , in December Jalloud successfully increased the price of Libyan oil . In 1970 , other OPEC states followed suit , leading to a global increase in the price of crude oil . The RCC followed with the Tripoli Agreement , in which they secured income tax , back-payments and better pricing from the oil corporations ; these measures brought Libya an estimated $ 1 billion in additional revenues in its first year .
The most widely used symbol is the flag of Greece , which features nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white representing the nine syllables of the Greek national motto Eleftheria i thanatos ( freedom or death ) , which was the motto of the Greek War of Independence . The blue square in the upper hoist-side corner bears a white cross , which represents Greek Orthodoxy . The Greek flag is widely used by the Greek Cypriots , although Cyprus has officially adopted a neutral flag to ease ethnic tensions with the Turkish Cypriot minority – see flag of Cyprus ) .
Three main parades take place during Carnival . The first is held on the first day , during which the " Carnival King " ( either a person in costume or an effigy ) rides through the city on his carriage . The second is held on the first Sunday of the festival and the participants are mainly children . The third and largest takes place on the last day of Carnival and involves hundreds of people walking in costume along the town 's longest avenue . The latter two parades are open to anyone who wishes to participate .
Eton 's best-known holiday takes place on the so-called " Fourth of June " , a celebration of the birthday of King George III , Eton 's greatest patron . This day is celebrated with the Procession of Boats , in which the top rowing crews from the top four years row past in vintage wooden rowing boats . Similar to the Queen 's Official Birthday , the " Fourth of June " is no longer celebrated on 4 June , but on the Wednesday before the first weekend of June . Eton also observes St. Andrew 's Day , on which the Eton wall game is played . [ citation needed ]
The bacterial cell is surrounded by a cell membrane ( also known as a lipid , cytoplasmic or plasma membrane ) . This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients , proteins and other essential components of the cytoplasm within the cell . As they are prokaryotes , bacteria do not usually have membrane-bound organelles in their cytoplasm , and thus contain few large intracellular structures . They lack a true nucleus , mitochondria , chloroplasts and the other organelles present in eukaryotic cells . Bacteria were once seen as simple bags of cytoplasm , but structures such as the prokaryotic cytoskeleton and the localization of proteins to specific locations within the cytoplasm that give bacteria some complexity have been discovered . These subcellular levels of organization have been called " bacterial hyperstructures " .
Having removed the monarchical government , Gaddafi proclaimed the foundation of the Libyan Arab Republic . Addressing the populace by radio , he proclaimed an end to the " reactionary and corrupt " regime , " the stench of which has sickened and horrified us all . " Due to the coup 's bloodless nature , it was initially labelled the " White Revolution " , although was later renamed the " One September Revolution " after the date on which it occurred . Gaddafi insisted that the Free Officers ' coup represented a revolution , marking the start of widespread change in the socio-economic and political nature of Libya . He proclaimed that the revolution meant " freedom , socialism , and unity " , and over the coming years implemented measures to achieve this .
Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century , and have together with vaccination led to the near eradication of diseases such as tuberculosis in the developed world . Their effectiveness and easy access led to overuse , especially in livestock raising , prompting bacteria to develop resistance . This has led to widespread problems with antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance , so much as to prompt the World Health Organization to classify antimicrobial resistance as a " serious threat [ that ] is no longer a prediction for the future , it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone , of any age , in any country " .
The modern Slavic peoples carry a variety of mitochondrial DNA haplogroups and Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups . Yet two paternal haplogroups predominate : R1a1a [ M17 ] and I2a2a [ L69.2=T/S163.2 ] . The frequency of Haplogroup R1a ranges from 63.39 % in the Sorbs , through 56.4 % in Poland , 54 % in Ukraine , 52 % in Russia , Belarus , to 15.2 % in Republic of Macedonia , 14.7 % in Bulgaria and 12.1 % in Herzegovina . The correlation between R1a1a [ M17 ] and the speakers of Indo-European languages , particularly those of Eastern Europe ( Russian ) and Central and Southern Asia , was noticed in the late 1990s . From this Spencer Wells and colleagues , following the Kurgan hypothesis , deduced that R1a1a arose on the Pontic-Caspian steppe .
Suffering ( Pāli : दुक्ख dukkha ; Sanskrit दुःख duḥkha ) is also a central concept in Buddhism . The word roughly corresponds to a number of terms in English including suffering , pain , unsatisfactoriness , sorrow , affliction , anxiety , dissatisfaction , discomfort , anguish , stress , misery , and frustration . Although the term is often translated as " suffering " , its philosophical meaning is more analogous to " disquietude " as in the condition of being disturbed . As such , " suffering " is too narrow a translation with " negative emotional connotations " [ web 9 ] that can give the impression that the Buddhist view is pessimistic , but Buddhism seeks to be neither pessimistic nor optimistic , but realistic . In English-language Buddhist literature translated from Pāli , " dukkha " is often left untranslated , so as to encompass its full range of meaning . [ note 8 ]
Less than 1 % of all species that have been described have been studied beyond simply noting their existence . The vast majority of Earth 's species are microbial . Contemporary biodiversity physics is " firmly fixated on the visible [ macroscopic ] world " . For example , microbial life is metabolically and environmentally more diverse than multicellular life ( see e.g. , extremophile ) . " On the tree of life , based on analyses of small-subunit ribosomal RNA , visible life consists of barely noticeable twigs . The inverse relationship of size and population recurs higher on the evolutionary ladder— " to a first approximation , all multicellular species on Earth are insects " . Insect extinction rates are high—supporting the Holocene extinction hypothesis .
Among Richmond 's most interesting architectural features is its Cast-iron architecture . Second only to New Orleans in its concentration of cast iron work , the city is home to a unique collection of cast iron porches , balconies , fences , and finials . Richmond 's position as a center of iron production helped to fuel its popularity within the city . At the height of production in the 1890 , 25 foundries operated in the city employing nearly 3,500 metal workers . This number is seven times the number of general construction workers being employed in Richmond at the time which illustrates the importance of its iron exports . Porches and fences in urban neighborhoods such as Jackson Ward , Church Hill , and Monroe Ward are particularly elaborate , often featuring ornate iron casts never replicated outside of Richmond . In some cases cast were made for a single residential or commercial application .
During the early High Middle Ages , Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty , which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period . In 1024 , they were replaced by the Salian dynasty , who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV ( r. 1084–1105 ) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy . His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility . A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V ( r. 1111–25 ) , who died without heirs , until Frederick I Barbarossa ( r. 1155–90 ) took the imperial throne . Although he ruled effectively , the basic problems remained , and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century . Barbarossa 's grandson Frederick II ( r. 1220–1250 ) , who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother , clashed repeatedly with the papacy . His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy . He and his successors faced many difficulties , including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century . Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus ' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241 , 1259 , and 1287 .
In July 2012 a United Nations Special Rapporteur called on the Tuvalu Government to develop a national water strategy to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation . In 2012 , Tuvalu developed a National Water Resources Policy under the Integrated Water Resource Management ( IWRM ) Project and the Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change ( PACC ) Project , which are sponsored by the Global Environment Fund/SOPAC . Government water planning has established a target of between 50 and 100L of water per person per day accounting for drinking water , cleaning , community and cultural activities .
In 1785 , the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York the national capital shortly after the war . New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States . In 1789 , the first President of the United States , George Washington , was inaugurated ; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time , and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted , all at Federal Hall on Wall Street . By 1790 , New York had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States .
In 1939 , coinciding with the start of World War II , Rene Dubos reported the discovery of the first naturally derived antibiotic , tyrothricin , a compound of 20 % gramicidin and 80 % tyrocidine , from B. brevis . It was one of the first commercially manufactured antibiotics universally and was very effective in treating wounds and ulcers during World War II . Gramicidin , however , could not be used systemically because of toxicity . Tyrocidine also proved too toxic for systemic usage . Research results obtained during that period were not shared between the Axis and the Allied powers during the war .
In 1744 , Burke started at Trinity College Dublin , a Protestant establishment , which up until 1793 , did not permit Catholics to take degrees . In 1747 , he set up a debating society , " Edmund Burke 's Club " , which , in 1770 , merged with TCD 's Historical Club to form the College Historical Society ; it is the oldest undergraduate society in the world . The minutes of the meetings of Burke 's Club remain in the collection of the Historical Society . Burke graduated from Trinity in 1748 . Burke 's father wanted him to read Law , and with this in mind he went to London in 1750 , where he entered the Middle Temple , before soon giving up legal study to travel in Continental Europe . After eschewing the Law , he pursued a livelihood through writing .
Light is the signal by which plants synchronize their internal clocks to their environment and is sensed by a wide variety of photoreceptors . Red and blue light are absorbed through several phytochromes and cryptochromes . One phytochrome , phyA , is the main phytochrome in seedlings grown in the dark but rapidly degrades in light to produce Cry1 . Phytochromes B–E are more stable with phyB , the main phytochrome in seedlings grown in the light . The cryptochrome ( cry ) gene is also a light-sensitive component of the circadian clock and is thought to be involved both as a photoreceptor and as part of the clock 's endogenous pacemaker mechanism . Cryptochromes 1–2 ( involved in blue–UVA ) help to maintain the period length in the clock through a whole range of light conditions .
Brigham Young University 's origin can be traced back to 1862 when a man named Warren Dusenberry started a Provo school in a prominent adobe building called Cluff Hall , which was located in the northeast corner of 200 East and 200 North . On October 16 , 1875 , Brigham Young , then president of the LDS Church , personally purchased the Lewis Building after previously hinting that a school would be built in Draper , Utah in 1867 . Hence , October 16 , 1875 is commonly held as BYU 's founding date . Said Young about his vision : " I hope to see an Academy established in Provo ... at which the children of the Latter-day Saints can receive a good education unmixed with the pernicious atheistic influences that are found in so many of the higher schools of the country . "
If the aircraft are VTOL-capable or helicopters , they do not need to decelerate and hence there is no such need . The arrested-recovery system has used an angled deck since the 1950s because , in case the aircraft does not catch the arresting wire , the short deck allows easier take off by reducing the number of objects between the aircraft and the end of the runway . It also has the advantage of separating the recovery operation area from the launch area . Helicopters and aircraft capable of vertical or short take-off and landing ( V/STOL ) usually recover by coming abreast the carrier on the port side and then using their hover capability to move over the flight deck and land vertically without the need for arresting gear .
Britain had been surprised by the sudden Prussian offensive but now began shipping supplies and ₤670,000 ( equivalent to ₤89.9 million in 2015 ) to its new ally . A combined force of allied German states was organised by the British to protect Hanover from French invasion , under the command of the Duke of Cumberland . The British attempted to persuade the Dutch Republic to join the alliance , but the request was rejected , as the Dutch wished to remain fully neutral . Despite the huge disparity in numbers , the year had been successful for the Prussian-led forces on the continent , in contrast to disappointing British campaigns in North America .
The relationships adolescents have with their peers , family , and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent . As an adolescent 's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances , they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends . This is not harmful ; however , if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations , this is an aspect of peer pressure . Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with . This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions , which also makes this a sensitive period . Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual . These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities , how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality . " The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation . In other words , by comparing one person 's personality characteristics to another 's , we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality ( and , ... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons ) . " This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one’s identity and self-concept , which includes ones personality , and underscores the importance of communication , and thus relationships , in one’s development . In social comparison we use reference groups , with respect to both psychological and identity development . These reference groups are the peers of adolescents . This means that who the teen chooses/accepts as their friends and who they communicate with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore have a huge impact on who they become . Research shows that relationships have the largest affect over the social development of an individual .
A further line in the directive stressed the need to inflict the heaviest losses possible , but also to intensify the air war in order to create the impression an amphibious assault on Britain was planned for 1941 . However , meteorological conditions over Britain were not favourable for flying and prevented an escalation in air operations . Airfields became water-logged and the 18 Kampfgruppen ( bomber groups ) of the Luftwaffe 's Kampfgeschwadern ( bomber wings ) were relocated to Germany for rest and re-equipment .
When Link enters the Twilight Realm , the void that corrupts parts of Hyrule , he transforms into a wolf . [ h ] He is eventually able to transform between his Hylian and wolf forms at will . As a wolf , Link loses the ability to use his sword , shield , or any secondary items ; he instead attacks by biting , and defends primarily by dodging attacks . However , " Wolf Link " gains several key advantages in return—he moves faster than he does as a human ( though riding Epona is still faster ) and digs holes to create new passages and uncover buried items , and has improved senses , including the ability to follow scent trails . [ i ] He also carries Midna , a small imp-like creature who gives him hints , uses an energy field to attack enemies , helps him jump long distances , and eventually allows Link to " warp " to any of several preset locations throughout the overworld . [ j ] Using Link 's wolf senses , the player can see and listen to the wandering spirits of those affected by the Twilight , as well as hunt for enemy ghosts named Poes . [ k ]
Hinduism is actively practiced , particularly in suburban areas of Henrico and Chesterfield . Some 6,000 families of Indian descent resided in the Richmond Region as of 2011 . Hindus are served by several temples and cultural centers . The two most familiar are the Cultural Center of India ( CCI ) located off of Iron Bridge Road in Chesterfield County and the Hindu Center of Virginia in Henrico County which has garnered national fame and awards for being the first LEED certified religious facility in the commonwealth .
In 1846 , the United States went to war against Mexico and sent a naval and land expedition to conquer Alta California . At first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports including San Diego , but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back . Following the successful revolt in Los Angeles , the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846 . Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24 , 1846 , when the Americans recaptured it . For the next several months the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo . Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night . The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out . On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General Stephen W. Kearney were at Warner 's Ranch . Commodore Robert F. Stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain Archibald Gillespie to march north to meet him . Their joint command of 150 men , returning to San Diego , encountered about 93 Californios under Andrés Pico . In the ensuing Battle of San Pasqual , fought in the San Pasqual Valley which is now part of the city of San Diego , the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign . Subsequently a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego , rescuing Kearny 's battered and blockaded command .
Unlike the Baroque style that it replaced , which was mostly used for palaces and churches , and had little representation in the British colonies , simpler Georgian styles were widely used by the upper and middle classes . Perhaps the best remaining house is the pristine Hammond-Harwood House ( 1774 ) in Annapolis , Maryland , designed by the colonial architect William Buckland and modelled on the Villa Pisani at Montagnana , Italy as depicted in Andrea Palladio 's I quattro libri dell'architettura ( " Four Books of Architecture " ) .
Despite conflicts with the rival monarchic Chetnik movement , Tito 's Partisans succeeded in liberating territory , notably the " Republic of Užice " . During this period , Tito held talks with Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović on 19 September and 27 October 1941 . It is said that Tito ordered his forces to assist escaping Jews , and that more than 2,000 Jews fought directly for Tito .
After the American Revolutionary War , the number and proportion of free people of color increased markedly in the North and the South as slaves were freed . Most northern states abolished slavery , sometimes , like New York , in programs of gradual emancipation that took more than two decades to be completed . The last slaves in New York were not freed until 1827 . In connection with the Second Great Awakening , Quaker and Methodist preachers in the South urged slaveholders to free their slaves . Revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves , some by deed and others by will , so that from 1782 to 1810 , the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the South .

The British dealt with range measurement first , when it was realised that range was the key to producing a better fuse setting . This led to the Height/Range Finder ( HRF ) , the first model being the Barr & Stroud UB2 , a 2-metre optical coincident rangefinder mounted on a tripod . It measured the distance to the target and the elevation angle , which together gave the height of the aircraft . These were complex instruments and various other methods were also used . The HRF was soon joined by the Height/Fuse Indicator ( HFI ) , this was marked with elevation angles and height lines overlaid with fuse length curves , using the height reported by the HRF operator , the necessary fuse length could be read off .
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in Egypt increased considerably before the removal of Hosni Mubarak , exceeding $ 6 billion in 2006 , due to economic liberalisation and privatisation measures taken by minister of investment Mahmoud Mohieddin . [ citation needed ] Since the fall of Hosni Mubarak in 2011 , Egypt has experienced a drastic fall in both foreign investment and tourism revenues , followed by a 60 % drop in foreign exchange reserves , a 3 % drop in growth , and a rapid devaluation of the Egyptian pound .
From April 20–23 , 1989 , pre-election meetings were held in Lviv for four consecutive days , drawing crowds of up to 25,000 . The action included an one-hour warning strike at eight local factories and institutions . It was the first labor strike in Lviv since 1944 . On May 3 , a pre-election rally attracted 30,000 in Lviv . On May 7 , The Memorial Society organized a mass meeting at Bykivnia , site of a mass grave of Ukrainian and Polish victims of Stalinist terror . After a march from Kiev to the site , a memorial service was staged .
A combination of urban and suburban development , the West Side is generally defined as the area west of I-10 . Western Tucson encompasses the banks of the Santa Cruz River and the foothills of the Tucson Mountains , and includes the International Wildlife Museum , Sentinel Peak , and the Marriott Starr Pass Resort & Spa , located in the wealthy enclave known as Starr Pass . Moving past the Tucson Mountains , travelers find themselves in the area commonly referred to as " west of " Tucson or " Old West Tucson " . A large undulating plain extending south into the Altar Valley , rural residential development predominates , but here you will also find major attractions including Saguaro National Park West , the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum , and the Old Tucson Studios movie set/theme park .
Contemporary chroniclers were mostly critical of John 's performance as king , and his reign has since been the subject of significant debate and periodic revision by historians from the 16th century onwards . Historian Jim Bradbury has summarised the contemporary historical opinion of John 's positive qualities , observing that John is today usually considered a " hard-working administrator , an able man , an able general " . Nonetheless , modern historians agree that he also had many faults as king , including what historian Ralph Turner describes as " distasteful , even dangerous personality traits " , such as pettiness , spitefulness and cruelty . These negative qualities provided extensive material for fiction writers in the Victorian era , and John remains a recurring character within Western popular culture , primarily as a villain in films and stories depicting the Robin Hood legends .
During the Partitions of Poland from 1772 to 1795 , its members began to lose these legal privileges and social status . From that point until 1918 , the legal status of the nobility was essentially dependent upon the policies of the three partitioning powers : the Russian Empire , the Kingdom of Prussia , and the Habsburg Monarchy . The legal privileges of the szlachta were legally abolished in the Second Polish Republic by the March Constitution of 1921 .
There are a vast range of commodity forms available to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion . The list of goods , services and places available is enormous : from dog perfumes , couture , furniture and housing , to dog groomers , therapists , trainers and caretakers , dog cafes , spas , parks and beaches , and dog hotels , airlines and cemeteries . While dog training as an organized activity can be traced back to the 18th century , in the last decades of the 20th century it became a high profile issue as many normal dog behaviors such as barking , jumping up , digging , rolling in dung , fighting , and urine marking ( which dogs do to establish territory through scent ) , became increasingly incompatible with the new role of a pet dog . Dog training books , classes and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued .
Hydrogen was liquefied for the first time by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention , the vacuum flask . He produced solid hydrogen the next year . Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey , and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford , Mark Oliphant , and Paul Harteck . Heavy water , which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen , was discovered by Urey 's group in 1932 . François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine , an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806 . Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819 . The Döbereiner 's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823 .
Teenage alcohol drug use is currently at an all-time low . Out of a polled body of students , 4.4 % of 8th graders reported having been on at least one occasion been drunk within the previous month ; for 10th graders , the number was 13.7 % , and for 12th graders , 25 % . More drastically , cigarette smoking has become a far less prevalent activity among American middle- and high-school students ; in fact , a greater number of teens now smoke marijuana than smoke cigarettes , with one recent study showing a respective 15.2 % versus 11.7 % of surveyed students . Recent studies have shown that male late adolescents are far more likely to smoke cigarettes rather than females . The study indicated that there was a discernible gender difference in the prevalence of smoking among the students . The finding of the study show that more males than females began smoking when they were in primary and high schools whereas most females started smoking after high school . This may be attributed to recent changing social and political views towards marijuana ; issues such as medicinal use and legalization have tended towards painting the drug in a more positive light than historically , while cigarettes continue to be vilified due to associated health risks .
In May 1970 , the Revolutionary Intellectuals Seminar was held to bring intellectuals in line with the revolution , while that year 's Legislative Review and Amendment united secular and religious law codes , introducing sharia into the legal system . Ruling by decree , the RCC maintained the monarchy 's ban on political parties , in May 1970 banned trade unions , and in 1972 outlawed workers ' strikes and suspended newspapers . In September 1971 , Gaddafi resigned , claiming to be dissatisfied with the pace of reform , but returned to his position within a month . In February 1973 , he resigned again , once more returning the following month .
Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass , mixed-grass , and tallgrass prairie , harbor expansive ecosystems in the state 's central and western portions , although cropland has largely replaced native grasses . Where rainfall is sparse in the western regions of the state , shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems , though pinyon pines , red cedar ( junipers ) , and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the far western reaches of the panhandle . Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare , disjunct species including sugar maple , bigtooth maple , nolina and southern live oak .
Compass-M1 transmits in 3 bands : E2 , E5B , and E6 . In each frequency band two coherent sub-signals have been detected with a phase shift of 90 degrees ( in quadrature ) . These signal components are further referred to as " I " and " Q " . The " I " components have shorter codes and are likely to be intended for the open service . The " Q " components have much longer codes , are more interference resistive , and are probably intended for the restricted service . IQ modulation has been the method in both wired and wireless digital modulation since morsetting carrier signal 100 years ago .
British post-punk entered the 1980s with support from members of the critical community—American critic Greil Marcus characterised " Britain 's postpunk pop avant-garde " in a 1980 Rolling Stone article as " sparked by a tension , humour and sense of paradox plainly unique in present day pop music " —as well as media figures such as BBC DJ John Peel , while several groups , such as PiL and Joy Division , achieved some success in the popular charts . The network of supportive record labels that included Industrial , Fast , E.G. , Mute , Axis/4AD and Glass continued to facilitate a large output of music , by artists such as the Raincoats , Essential Logic , Killing Joke , the Teardrop Explodes , and the Psychedelic Furs .
The West Bank was annexed by Jordan in 1950 , following the Arab rejection of the UN decision to create two states in Palestine . Only Britain recognized this annexation and Jordan has since ceded its claim to the territory to the PLO . The West Bank was occupied by Israel in 1967 during the Six-Day War . The population are mainly Palestinians , including refugees of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War . From their occupation in 1967 until 1993 , the Palestinians living in these territories were under Israeli military administration . Since the Israel–PLO letters of recognition , most of the Palestinian population and cities have been under the internal jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority , and only partial Israeli military control , although Israel has on several occasions redeployed its troops and reinstated full military administration during periods of unrest . In response to increasing attacks as part of the Second Intifada , the Israeli government started to construct the Israeli West Bank barrier . When completed , approximately 13 % of the Barrier will be constructed on the Green Line or in Israel with 87 % inside the West Bank .
In Serbia , the Serbian language is the official one , while both Serbian and Croatian are official in the province of Vojvodina . A large Bosniak minority is present in the southwest region of Sandžak , but the " official recognition " of Bosnian language is moot . Bosnian is an optional course in 1st and 2nd grade of the elementary school , while it is also in official use in the municipality of Novi Pazar . However , its nomenclature is controversial , as there is incentive that it is referred to as " Bosniak " ( bošnjački ) rather than " Bosnian " ( bosanski ) ( see Bosnian language for details ) .
In 1913 , Elmer McCollum discovered the first vitamins , fat-soluble vitamin A , and water-soluble vitamin B ( in 1915 ; now known to be a complex of several water-soluble vitamins ) and named vitamin C as the then-unknown substance preventing scurvy . Lafayette Mendel and Thomas Osborne also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B . In 1919 , Sir Edward Mellanby incorrectly identified rickets as a vitamin A deficiency because he could cure it in dogs with cod liver oil . In 1922 , McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil , but found that it still cured rickets . Also in 1922 , H.M. Evans and L.S . Bishop discover vitamin E as essential for rat pregnancy , originally calling it " food factor X " until 1925 .
The largest mammal to live in the highest altitudes are the alpine ibex , which have been sighted as high as 3,000 m ( 9,843 ft ) . The ibex live in caves and descend to eat the succulent alpine grasses . Classified as antelopes , chamois are smaller than ibex and found throughout the Alps , living above the tree line and are common in the entire alpine range . Areas of the eastern Alps are still home to brown bears . In Switzerland the canton of Bern was named for the bears but the last bear is recorded as having been killed in 1792 above Kleine Scheidegg by three hunters from Grindelwald .
In addition , the city has about 160 museums—the world 's greatest single metropolitan concentration —over 100 art galleries , and some 30 concert halls , all of which maintain a constant cultural activity during the whole year . It has either the third or fourth-highest number of theatres in the world after New York , London and perhaps Toronto . Many areas ( e.g . Palacio Nacional and the National Institute of Cardiology ) have murals painted by Diego Rivera . He and his wife Frida Kahlo lived in Coyoacán , where several of their homes , studios , and art collections are open to the public . The house where Leon Trotsky was initially granted asylum and finally murdered in 1940 is also in Coyoacán .
Following the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912 , Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Tibet Area ( Ü-Tsang ) . The region subsequently declared its independence in 1913 without recognition by the subsequent Chinese Republican government . Later , Lhasa took control of the western part of Xikang , China . The region maintained its autonomy until 1951 when , following the Battle of Chamdo , Tibet became incorporated into the People 's Republic of China , and the previous Tibetan government was abolished in 1959 after a failed uprising . Today , China governs western and central Tibet as the Tibet Autonomous Region while the eastern areas are now mostly ethnic autonomous prefectures within Sichuan , Qinghai and other neighbouring provinces . There are tensions regarding Tibet 's political status and dissident groups that are active in exile . It is also said that Tibetan activists in Tibet have been arrested or tortured .
Politically , Orthodox Jews , given their variety of movements and affiliations , tend not to conform easily to the standard left-right political spectrum , with one of the key differences between the movements stemming from the groups ' attitudes to Zionism . Generally speaking , of the three key strands of Orthodox Judaism , Haredi Orthodox and Hasidic Orthodox Jews are at best ambivalent towards the ideology of Zionism and the creation of the State of Israel , and there are many groups and organisations who are outspokenly anti-Zionistic , seeing the ideology of Zionism as diametrically opposed to the teaching of the Torah , and the Zionist administration of the State of Israel , with its emphasis on militarism and nationalism , as destructive of the Judaic way of life .
Washington University has a large number of student-run musical groups on campus , including 12 official a cappella groups . The Pikers , an all-male group , is the oldest such group on campus . The Greenleafs , an all-female group is the oldest ( and only ) female group on campus . The Mosaic Whispers , founded in 1991 , is the oldest co-ed group on campus . They have produced 9 albums and have appeared on a number of compilation albums , including Ben Folds ' Ben Folds Presents : University A Cappella ! The Amateurs , who also appeared on this album , is another co-ed a cappella group on campus , founded in 1991 . They have recorded seven albums and toured extensively . After Dark is a co-ed a cappella group founded in 2001 . It has released three albums and has won several Contemporary A Capella Recording ( CARA ) awards . In 2008 the group performed on MSNBC during coverage of the vice presidential debate with specially written songs about Joe Biden and Sarah Palin . The Ghost Lights , founded in 2010 , is the campus 's newest and only Broadway , Movies , and Television soundtrack group . They have performed multiple philanthropic concerts in the greater St. Louis area and were honored in November 2010 with the opportunity to perform for Nobel Laureate Douglass North at his birthday celebration .
In an effort at revitalizing the city , New Jersey voters in 1976 passed a referendum , approving casino gambling for Atlantic City ; this came after a 1974 referendum on legalized gambling failed to pass . Immediately after the legislation passed , the owners of the Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel began converting it into the Resorts International . It was the first legal casino in the eastern United States when it opened on May 26 , 1978 . Other casinos were soon constructed along the Boardwalk and , later , in the marina district for a total of eleven today . The introduction of gambling did not , however , quickly eliminate many of the urban problems that plagued Atlantic City . Many people have suggested that it only served to exacerbate those problems , as attested to by the stark contrast between tourism intensive areas and the adjacent impoverished working-class neighborhoods . In addition , Atlantic City has been less popular than Las Vegas , as a gambling city in the United States . Donald Trump helped bring big name boxing bouts to the city to attract customers to his casinos . The boxer Mike Tyson had most of his fights in Atlantic City in the 1980s , which helped Atlantic City achieve nationwide attention as a gambling resort . Numerous highrise condominiums were built for use as permanent residences or second homes . By end of the decade it was one of the most popular tourist destinations in the United States .
Schwarzenegger 's commercial peak was his return as the title character in 1991 's Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , which was the highest-grossing film of 1991 . In 1993 , the National Association of Theatre Owners named him the " International Star of the Decade " . His next film project , the 1993 self-aware action comedy spoof Last Action Hero , was released opposite Jurassic Park , and did not do well at the box office . His next film , the comedy drama True Lies ( 1994 ) , was a popular spy film , and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron .
The construction of cathedrals and castles advanced building technology , leading to the development of large stone buildings . Ancillary structures included new town halls , houses , bridges , and tithe barns . Shipbuilding improved with the use of the rib and plank method rather than the old Roman system of mortise and tenon . Other improvements to ships included the use of lateen sails and the stern-post rudder , both of which increased the speed at which ships could be sailed .
Judging by the historical records , by approximately 1000 AD the predominant ethnic group over much of modern European Russia , Ukraine and Belarus was the Eastern branch of the Slavs , speaking a closely related group of dialects . The political unification of this region into Kievan Rus ' in about 880 , from which modern Russia , Ukraine and Belarus trace their origins , established Old East Slavic as a literary and commercial language . It was soon followed by the adoption of Christianity in 988 and the introduction of the South Slavic Old Church Slavonic as the liturgical and official language . Borrowings and calques from Byzantine Greek began to enter the Old East Slavic and spoken dialects at this time , which in their turn modified the Old Church Slavonic as well .
Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas primarily focus on Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups and Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups . " Y-DNA " is passed solely along the patrilineal line , from father to son , while " mtDNA " is passed down the matrilineal line , from mother to offspring of both sexes . Neither recombines , and thus Y-DNA and mtDNA change only by chance mutation at each generation with no intermixture between parents ' genetic material . Autosomal " atDNA " markers are also used , but differ from mtDNA or Y-DNA in that they overlap significantly . AtDNA is generally used to measure the average continent-of-ancestry genetic admixture in the entire human genome and related isolated populations .
Human interference has nearly exterminated the trees in many areas , and , except for the beech forests of the Austrian Alps , forests of deciduous trees are rarely found after the extreme deforestation between the 17th and 19th centuries . The vegetation has changed since the second half of the 20th century , as the high alpine meadows cease to be harvested for hay or used for grazing which eventually might result in a regrowth of forest . In some areas the modern practice of building ski runs by mechanical means has destroyed the underlying tundra from which the plant life can not recover during the non-skiing months , whereas areas that still practice a natural piste type of ski slope building preserve the fragile underlayers .
In September 1998 , the Fraunhofer Institute sent a letter to several developers of MP3 software stating that a license was required to " distribute and/or sell decoders and/or encoders " . The letter claimed that unlicensed products " infringe the patent rights of Fraunhofer and Thomson . To make , sell and/or distribute products using the [ MPEG Layer-3 ] standard and thus our patents , you need to obtain a license under these patents from us . "
In June 1963 , Rev . Martin Luther King , Jr. gave a major speech in Detroit that foreshadowed his " I Have a Dream " speech in Washington , D.C. two months later . While the African-American Civil Rights Movement gained significant federal civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965 , longstanding inequities resulted in confrontations between the police and inner city black youth wanting change . Longstanding tensions in Detroit culminated in the Twelfth Street riot in July 1967 . Governor George W. Romney ordered the Michigan National Guard into Detroit , and President Johnson sent in U.S. Army troops . The result was 43 dead , 467 injured , over 7,200 arrests , and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed , mostly in black residential and business areas . Thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods . The affected district lay in ruins for decades . It was the most costly riot in the United States .
The Zhengde Emperor ( r. 1505–1521 ) , who enjoyed the company of lamas at court despite protests from the censorate , had heard tales of a " living Buddha " which he desired to host at the Ming capital ; this was none other than the Rinpung-supported Mikyö Dorje , 8th Karmapa Lama then occupying Lhasa . Zhengde 's top advisors made every attempt to dissuade him from inviting this lama to court , arguing that Tibetan Buddhism was wildly heterodox and unorthodox . Despite protests by the Grand Secretary Liang Chu , in 1515 the Zhengde Emperor sent his eunuch official Liu Yun of the Palace Chancellery on a mission to invite this Karmapa to Beijing . Liu commanded a fleet of hundreds of ships requisitioned along the Yangtze , consuming 2,835 g ( 100 oz ) of silver a day in food expenses while stationed for a year in Chengdu of Sichuan . After procurring necessary gifts for the mission , he departed with a cavalry force of about 1,000 troops . When the request was delivered , the Karmapa lama refused to leave Tibet despite the Ming force brought to coerce him . The Karmapa launched a surprise ambush on Liu Yun 's camp , seizing all the goods and valuables while killing or wounding half of Liu Yun 's entire escort . After this fiasco , Liu fled for his life , but only returned to Chengdu several years later to find that the Zhengde Emperor had died .
After the English Civil War the Royal Citadel was built in 1666 on the east end of Plymouth Hoe , to defend the port from naval attacks , suppress Plymothian Parliamentary leanings and to train the armed forces . Guided tours are available in the summer months . Further west is Smeaton 's Tower , which was built in 1759 as a lighthouse on rocks 14 miles ( 23 km ) off shore , but dismantled and the top two thirds rebuilt on the Hoe in 1877 . It is open to the public and has views over the Plymouth Sound and the city from the lantern room . Plymouth has 20 war memorials of which nine are on The Hoe including : Plymouth Naval Memorial , to remember those killed in World Wars I and II , and the Armada Memorial , to commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada .
In music , popular local bands include The Five Stars , Penina o Tiafau and Punialava'a . The Yandall Sisters ' cover of the song Sweet Inspiration reached number one on the New Zealand charts in 1974 . King Kapisi was the first hip hop artist to receive the prestigious New Zealand APRA Silver Scroll Award in 1999 for his song Reverse Resistance . The music video for Reverse Resistance was filmed in Savai'i at his villages . Other successful Samoan hip hop artists include rapper Scribe , Dei Hamo , Savage and Tha Feelstyle whose music video Suamalie was filmed in Samoa .
Humbert is at the center of ascetic writers in the Dominican Order . In this role , he added significantly to its spirituality . His writings are permeated with " religious good sense , " and he used uncomplicated language that could edify even the weakest member . Humbert advised his readers , " [ Young Dominicans ] are also to be instructed not to be eager to see visions or work miracles , since these avail little to salvation , and sometimes we are fooled by them ; but rather they should be eager to do good in which salvation consists . Also , they should be taught not to be sad if they do not enjoy the divine consolations they hear others have ; but they should know the loving Father for some reason sometimes withholds these . Again , they should learn that if they lack the grace of compunction or devotion they should not think they are not in the state of grace as long as they have good will , which is all that God regards " .
The senate 's ultimate authority derived from the esteem and prestige of the senators . This esteem and prestige was based on both precedent and custom , as well as the caliber and reputation of the senators . The senate passed decrees , which were called senatus consulta . These were officially " advice " from the senate to a magistrate . In practice , however , they were usually followed by the magistrates . The focus of the Roman senate was usually directed towards foreign policy . Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict , the senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs . The power of the senate expanded over time as the power of the legislative assemblies declined , and the senate took a greater role in ordinary law-making . Its members were usually appointed by Roman Censors , who ordinarily selected newly elected magistrates for membership in the senate , making the senate a partially elected body . During times of military emergency , such as the civil wars of the 1st century BC , this practice became less prevalent , as the Roman Dictator , Triumvir or the senate itself would select its members .
Sicily fell under the control of the Holy Roman Empire in 1194 . Palermo was the preferred city of the Emperor Frederick II . Muslims of Palermo emigrated or were expelled during Holy Roman rule . After an interval of Angevin rule ( 1266–1282 ) , Sicily came under control of the Aragon and Barcelona dynasties . By 1330 , Palermo 's population had declined to 51,000 . From 1479 until 1713 Palermo was ruled by the Kingdom of Spain , and again between 1717 and 1718 . Palermo was also under Savoy control between 1713 and 1717 and 1718–1720 as a result of the Treaty of Utrecht . It was also ruled by Austria between 1720 and 1734 .
In January 2012 a Tuareg rebellion began in Northern Mali , led by the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad . In March , military officer Amadou Sanogo seized power in a coup d'état , citing Touré 's failures in quelling the rebellion , and leading to sanctions and an embargo by the Economic Community of West African States . The MNLA quickly took control of the north , declaring independence as Azawad . However , Islamist groups including Ansar Dine and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ( AQIM ) , who had helped the MNLA defeat the government , turned on the Tuareg and took control of the North with the goal of implementing sharia in Mali .
The main passenger airport serving the metropolis and the state is Melbourne Airport ( also called Tullamarine Airport ) , which is the second busiest in Australia , and the Port of Melbourne is Australia 's busiest seaport for containerised and general cargo . Melbourne has an extensive transport network . The main metropolitan train terminus is Flinders Street Station , and the main regional train and coach terminus is Southern Cross Station . Melbourne is also home to Australia 's most extensive freeway network and has the world 's largest urban tram network .
Dvaitādvaita was proposed by Nimbarka , a 13th-century Vaishnava Philosopher from the Andhra region . According to this philosophy there are three categories of existence : Brahman , soul , and matter . Soul and matter are different from Brahman in that they have attributes and capacities different from Brahman . Brahman exists independently , while soul and matter are dependent . Thus soul and matter have an existence that is separate yet dependent . Further , Brahman is a controller , the soul is the enjoyer , and matter the thing enjoyed . Also , the highest object of worship is Krishna and his consort Radha , attended by thousands of gopis ; of the Vrindavan ; and devotion consists in self-surrender .
A different format , CD-4 ( not to be confused with compact disc ) , by RCA , encoded the front-rear difference information on an ultrasonic carrier , which required a special wideband cartridge to capture it on carefully calibrated pickup arm/turntable combinations . CD-4 was even less successful than the two matrixed formats . ( A further problem was that no cutting heads were available that could handle the HF information . That was remedied by cutting at half the speed . Later , the special half-speed cutting heads and equalization techniques were employed to get a wider frequency response in stereo with reduced distortion and greater headroom . )
Madonna 's Italian-Catholic background and her relationship with her parents are reflected in the album Like a Prayer . It was an evocation of the impact religion had on her career . Her video for the title track contains Catholic symbolism , such as the stigmata . During The Virgin Tour , she wore a rosary and prayed with it in the music video for " La Isla Bonita " . The " Open Your Heart " video sees her boss scolding her in the Italian language . On the Who 's That Girl World Tour , she dedicated the song " Papa Do n't Preach " to Pope John Paul II .
New York City has more than 2,000 arts and cultural organizations and more than 500 art galleries of all sizes . The city government funds the arts with a larger annual budget than the National Endowment for the Arts . Wealthy business magnates in the 19th century built a network of major cultural institutions , such as the famed Carnegie Hall and The Metropolitan Museum of Art , that would become internationally established . The advent of electric lighting led to elaborate theater productions , and in the 1880s , New York City theaters on Broadway and along 42nd Street began featuring a new stage form that became known as the Broadway musical . Strongly influenced by the city 's immigrants , productions such as those of Harrigan and Hart , George M. Cohan , and others used song in narratives that often reflected themes of hope and ambition .
In the beginning , racial classifications that identified race were inherently suspect and subject to strict scrutiny . These classifications would only be upheld if necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest . Later the U.S. Supreme Court decided that racial classifications that benefited underrepresented minorities were to only be upheld if necessary and promoted a compelling governmental purpose . ( See Richmond v. J.A . Croson Co. ) There is no clear guidance about when government action is not " compelling " , and such rulings are rare .
Ann Arbor was founded in 1824 , named for wives of the village 's founders and the stands of Bur Oak trees . The University of Michigan moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor in 1837 , and the city grew at a rapid rate in the early to mid-20th century . During the 1960s and 1970s , the city gained a reputation as a center for left-wing politics . Ann Arbor became a focal point for political activism and served as a hub for the civil-rights movement and anti-Vietnam War movement , as well as various student movements .
By mid-1942 , the Japanese found themselves holding a vast area from the Indian Ocean to the Central Pacific , even though they lacked the resources to defend or sustain it . Moreover , Combined Fleet doctrine was inadequate to execute the proposed " barrier " defence . Instead , Japan decided on additional attacks in both the south and central Pacific . While she had the element of surprise at Pearl Harbor , Allied codebreakers had now turned the tables . They discovered an attack was planned against Port Moresby ; if it fell , Japan would control the seas to the north and west of Australia and could isolate the country . The carrier USS Lexington under Admiral Fletcher joined USS Yorktown and an American-Australian task force to stop the Japanese advance . The resulting Battle of the Coral Sea , fought in May 1942 , was the first naval battle in which ships involved never sighted each other and only aircraft were used to attack opposing forces . Although Lexington was sunk and Yorktown seriously damaged , the Japanese lost the carrier Shōhō , and suffered extensive damage to Shōkaku and heavy losses to the air wing of Zuikaku , both of which missed the operation against Midway the following month . Although Allied losses were heavier than Japanese , the attack on Port Moresby was thwarted and the Japanese invasion force turned back , a strategic victory for the Allies . The Japanese were forced to abandon their attempts to isolate Australia . Moreover , Japan lacked the capacity to replace losses in ships , planes and trained pilots .
In the PAL region , which covers most of Africa , Asia , Europe , and Oceania , Twilight Princess is the best-selling entry in the Zelda series . During its first week , the game was sold with three of every four Wii purchases . The game had sold 5.82 million copies on the Wii as of March 31 , 2011 [ update ] , and 1.32 million on the GameCube as of March 31 , 2007 [ update ] .
Modern navies that operate such aircraft carriers treat them as the capital ship of the fleet , a role previously held by the battleship . This change took place during World War II in response to air power becoming a significant factor in warfare , driven by the superior range , flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft . Following the war , carrier operations continued to increase in size and importance . Supercarriers , displacing 75,000 tonnes or greater , have become the pinnacle of carrier development . Some are powered by nuclear reactors and form the core of a fleet designed to operate far from home . Amphibious assault ships , such as USS Tarawa and HMS Ocean , serve the purpose of carrying and landing Marines , and operate a large contingent of helicopters for that purpose . Also known as " commando carriers " or " helicopter carriers " , many have the capability to operate VSTOL aircraft .
The New Haven Division buses follow routes that had originally been covered by trolley service . Horse-drawn steetcars began operating in New Haven in the 1860s , and by the mid-1890s all the lines had become electric . In the 1920s and 1930s , some of the trolley lines began to be replaced by bus lines , with the last trolley route converted to bus in 1948 . The City of New Haven is in the very early stages of considering the restoration of streetcar ( light-rail ) service , which has been absent since the postwar period .
Tennis player Marcos Baghdatis was ranked 8th in the world , was a finalist at the Australian Open , and reached the Wimbledon semi-final , all in 2006 . High jumper Kyriakos Ioannou achieved a jump of 2.35 m at the 11th IAAF World Championships in Athletics in Osaka , Japan , in 2007 , winning the bronze medal . He has been ranked third in the world . In motorsports , Tio Ellinas is a successful race car driver , currently racing in the GP3 Series for Marussia Manor Motorsport . There is also mixed martial artist Costas Philippou , who competes in the Ultimate Fighting Championship promotion 's middleweight division . Costas holds a 6-3 record in UFC bouts , and recently defeated " The Monsoon " Lorenz Larkin with a Knockout in the 1st round .
Investitures , which include the conferring of knighthoods by dubbing with a sword , and other awards take place in the palace 's Ballroom , built in 1854 . At 36.6 m ( 120 ft ) long , 18 m ( 59 ft ) wide and 13.5 m ( 44 ft ) high , it is the largest room in the palace . It has replaced the throne room in importance and use . During investitures , the Queen stands on the throne dais beneath a giant , domed velvet canopy , known as a shamiana or a baldachin , that was used at the Delhi Durbar in 1911 . A military band plays in the musicians ' gallery as award recipients approach the Queen and receive their honours , watched by their families and friends .
Elizabeth I of England , primarily interested in trade with the east , collaborated with English merchants to form the first trading companies to the far-flung regions , using their own jargon . Their goals were to obtain trading concessions by treaty . The queen chartered the Company of Merchants of the Levant , shortened to Levant Company , and soon known also as The Turkey Company , in 1581 . In 1582 , the ship The Great Susan transported the first ambassador , William Harebone , to the Ottoman Porte ( government of the Ottoman Empire ) at Constantinople . Compared to Anatolia , Levant also means " land of the rising sun , " but where Anatolia always only meant the projection of land currently occupied by the Republic of Turkey , Levant meant anywhere in the domain ruled by the Ottoman Porte . The East India Company ( short for a much longer formal name ) was chartered in 1600 for trade to the East Indies .
Neptune 's dark spots are thought to occur in the troposphere at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features , so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks . As they are stable features that can persist for several months , they are thought to be vortex structures . Often associated with dark spots are brighter , persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer . The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature . Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism .
Plymouth is often used as a base by visitors to Dartmoor , the Tamar Valley and the beaches of south-east Cornwall . Kingsand , Cawsand and Whitsand Bay are popular .
In 2006–07 , researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society studied gorillas in heavily forested regions centered on the Ouesso district of the Sangha Region . They suggest a population on the order of 125,000 Western Lowland Gorillas , whose isolation from humans has been largely preserved by inhospitable swamps .
Mexico City offers a variety of cuisines . Restaurants specializing in the regional cuisines of Mexico 's 31 states are available in the city . Also available are an array of international cuisines , including Canadian , French , Italian , Croatian , Spanish ( including many regional variations ) , Jewish , Lebanese , Chinese ( again with regional variations ) , Indian , Japanese , Korean , Thai , Vietnamese ; and of course fellow Latin American cuisines such as Argentine , Brazilian , and Peruvian . Haute , fusion , kosher , vegetarian and vegan cuisines are also available , as are restaurants solely based on the concepts of local food and slow Food .
In the 2000 presidential election , Vice President Al Gore , a former Democratic U.S . Senator from Tennessee , failed to carry his home state , an unusual occurrence but indicative of strengthening Republican support . Republican George W. Bush received increased support in 2004 , with his margin of victory in the state increasing from 4 % in 2000 to 14 % in 2004 . Democratic presidential nominees from Southern states ( such as Lyndon B. Johnson , Jimmy Carter , Bill Clinton ) usually fare better than their Northern counterparts do in Tennessee , especially among split-ticket voters outside the metropolitan areas .
Leakage is equivalent to a resistor in parallel with the capacitor . Constant exposure to heat can cause dielectric breakdown and excessive leakage , a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits , particularly where oiled paper and foil capacitors were used . In many vacuum tube circuits , interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage . A leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting , causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube . In power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red , or current limiting resistors to overheat , even fail . Similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid-state ( transistor ) amplifiers , but owing to lower heat production and the use of modern polyester dielectric barriers this once-common problem has become relatively rare .
The Han-era Chinese sailed in a variety of ships differing from those of previous eras , such as the tower ship . The junk design was developed and realized during Han . Junks featured a square-ended bow and stern , a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost , and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western vessels . Moreover , Han ships were the first in the world to be steered using a rudder at the stern , in contrast to the simpler steering oar used for riverine transport , allowing them to sail on the high seas .
The bacterial cell is surrounded by a cell membrane ( also known as a lipid , cytoplasmic or plasma membrane ) . This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients , proteins and other essential components of the cytoplasm within the cell . As they are prokaryotes , bacteria do not usually have membrane-bound organelles in their cytoplasm , and thus contain few large intracellular structures . They lack a true nucleus , mitochondria , chloroplasts and the other organelles present in eukaryotic cells . Bacteria were once seen as simple bags of cytoplasm , but structures such as the prokaryotic cytoskeleton and the localization of proteins to specific locations within the cytoplasm that give bacteria some complexity have been discovered . These subcellular levels of organization have been called " bacterial hyperstructures " .
Emotion regulation refers to the cognitive and behavioral strategies people use to influence their own emotional experience . For example , a behavioral strategy in which one avoids a situation to avoid unwanted emotions ( e.g. , trying not to think about the situation , doing distracting activities , etc. ) . Depending on the particular school 's general emphasis on either cognitive components of emotion , physical energy discharging , or on symbolic movement and facial expression components of emotion , different schools of psychotherapy approach the regulation of emotion differently . Cognitively oriented schools approach them via their cognitive components , such as rational emotive behavior therapy . Yet others approach emotions via symbolic movement and facial expression components ( like in contemporary Gestalt therapy ) .
The body’s capability to react to antigen depends on a person 's age , antigen type , maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented . Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency , because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed . Once born , a child’s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides . In fact , many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas . In neonates , opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited . For example , the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65 % of that found in the adult . Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns . This is due to lower opsonic activity , as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors , which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium . Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production , which also limits the newborn 's phagocytic activity . Although , the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults , the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired . Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells . Also , T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-12 , and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage . B cells develop early during gestation but are not fully active .
The city is also in the process of implementing a 5-year and 20 year Bike Action Plan with a goal of attaining 14 to 35 % bicycle transportation mode share by 2030 through the installation of enhanced bicycle infrastructure throughout the city . Other environmentally focused initiatives include curbside recycling , curbside composting bins ( in addition to trash , yard-waste , and recycle bins ) , farmers ' markets , community gardens , garden-share , an urban forest initiative , a hazardous materials home-collection service , green business certification , and a municipal bus system which is currently being revamped to integrate with the soon-to-open Expo Line .
In 1775 , Patrick Henry delivered his famous " Give me Liberty or Give me Death " speech in St. John 's Church in Richmond , crucial for deciding Virginia 's participation in the First Continental Congress and setting the course for revolution and independence . On April 18 , 1780 , the state capital was moved from the colonial capital of Williamsburg to Richmond , to provide a more centralized location for Virginia 's increasing westerly population , as well as to isolate the capital from British attack . The latter motive proved to be in vain , and in 1781 , under the command of Benedict Arnold , Richmond was burned by British troops , causing Governor Thomas Jefferson to flee as the Virginia militia , led by Sampson Mathews , defended the city .
The January daily average is 33.0 °F ( 0.6 °C ) , though , in a normal winter , the temperature frequently rises to 50 °F ( 10 °C ) during thaws and dips to 10 °F ( −12 °C ) for 2 or 3 nights . July averages 78.1 °F ( 25.6 °C ) , although heat waves accompanied by high humidity and heat indices are frequent ; highs reach or exceed 90 °F ( 32 °C ) on 27 days of the year . The average window for freezing temperatures is November 6 thru April 2 , allowing a growing season of 217 days . Early fall and late winter are generally dry ; February 's average of 2.64 inches ( 67 mm ) makes it the area 's driest month . The dewpoint in the summer averages between 59.1 °F ( 15 °C ) to 64.5 °F ( 18 °C ) .
In the resulting Battle of Pusan Perimeter ( August–September 1950 ) , the U.S. Army withstood KPA attacks meant to capture the city at the Naktong Bulge , P'ohang-dong , and Taegu . The United States Air Force ( USAF ) interrupted KPA logistics with 40 daily ground support sorties that destroyed 32 bridges , halting most daytime road and rail traffic . KPA forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night . To deny matériel to the KPA , the USAF destroyed logistics depots , petroleum refineries , and harbors , while the U.S. Navy air forces attacked transport hubs . Consequently , the over-extended KPA could not be supplied throughout the south . On 27 August , 67th Fighter Squadron aircraft mistakenly attacked facilities in Chinese territory and the Soviet Union called the UN Security Council 's attention to China 's complaint about the incident . The US proposed that a commission of India and Sweden determine what the US should pay in compensation but the Soviets vetoed the US proposal .
Charles Darwin 's book The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms ( 1881 ) presented the first scientific analysis of earthworms ' contributions to soil fertility . Some burrow while others live entirely on the surface , generally in moist leaf litter . The burrowers loosen the soil so that oxygen and water can penetrate it , and both surface and burrowing worms help to produce soil by mixing organic and mineral matter , by accelerating the decomposition of organic matter and thus making it more quickly available to other organisms , and by concentrating minerals and converting them to forms that plants can use more easily . Earthworms are also important prey for birds ranging in size from robins to storks , and for mammals ranging from shrews to badgers , and in some cases conserving earthworms may be essential for conserving endangered birds .
Santa Monica College is a junior college originally founded in 1929 . Many SMC graduates transfer to the University of California system . It occupies 35 acres ( 14 hectares ) and enrolls 30,000 students annually . The Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School , associated with the RAND Corporation , is the U.S. 's largest producer of public policy PhDs . The Art Institute of California – Los Angeles is also located in Santa Monica near the Santa Monica Airport . Universities and colleges within a 22-mile ( 35 km ) radius from Santa Monica include Santa Monica College , Antioch University Los Angeles , Loyola Marymount University , Mount St. Mary 's College , Pepperdine University , California State University , Northridge , California State University , Los Angeles , UCLA , USC , West Los Angeles College , California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) , Occidental College ( Oxy ) , Los Angeles City College , Los Angeles Southwest College , Los Angeles Valley College , and Emperor 's College of Traditional Oriental Medicine .
Every major company selling the antipsychotics — Bristol-Myers Squibb , Eli Lilly , Pfizer , AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson — has either settled recent government cases , under the False Claims Act , for hundreds of millions of dollars or is currently under investigation for possible health care fraud . Following charges of illegal marketing , two of the settlements set records last year for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations . One involved Eli Lilly 's antipsychotic Zyprexa , and the other involved Bextra . In the Bextra case , the government also charged Pfizer with illegally marketing another antipsychotic , Geodon ; Pfizer settled that part of the claim for $ 301 million , without admitting any wrongdoing .
Purebred dogs of one breed are genetically distinguishable from purebred dogs of other breeds , but the means by which kennel clubs classify dogs is unsystematic . Systematic analyses of the dog genome has revealed only four major types of dogs that can be said to be statistically distinct . These include the " old world dogs " ( e.g. , Malamute and Shar Pei ) , " Mastiff " -type ( e.g. , English Mastiff ) , " herding " -type ( e.g. , Border Collie ) , and " all others " ( also called " modern " - or " hunting " -type ) .
The resultant South Korean government promulgated a national political constitution on 17 July 1948 , and elected Syngman Rhee as President on 20 July 1948 . The Republic of Korea ( South Korea ) was established on 15 August 1948 . In the Russian Korean Zone of Occupation , the Soviet Union established a Communist North Korean government led by Kim Il-sung . President Rhee 's régime excluded communists and leftists from southern politics . Disenfranchised , they headed for the hills , to prepare for guerrilla war against the US-sponsored ROK Government .
The Karabakh war ended after a Russian-brokered cease-fire was put in place in 1994 . The war was a success for the Karabakh Armenian forces who managed to capture 16 % of Azerbaijan 's internationally recognised territory including Nagorno-Karabakh itself . Since then , Armenia and Azerbaijan have held peace talks , mediated by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) . The status of Karabakh has yet to be determined . The economies of both countries have been hurt in the absence of a complete resolution and Armenia 's borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan remain closed . By the time both Azerbaijan and Armenia had finally agreed to a ceasefire in 1994 , an estimated 30,000 people had been killed and over a million had been displaced .
Fearing the worst , the Romans began a major mobilization , all but pulling out of recently pacified Spain and Gaul . They even established a major garrison in Sicily in case the Seleucids ever got to Italy . This fear was shared by Rome 's Greek allies , who had largely ignored Rome in the years after the Second Macedonian War , but now followed Rome again for the first time since that war . A major Roman-Greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the Second Punic War , Scipio Africanus , and set out for Greece , beginning the Roman-Syrian War . After initial fighting that revealed serious Seleucid weaknesses , the Seleucids tried to turn the Roman strength against them at the Battle of Thermopylae ( as they believed the 300 Spartans had done centuries earlier ) . Like the Spartans , the Seleucids lost the battle , and were forced to evacuate Greece . The Romans pursued the Seleucids by crossing the Hellespont , which marked the first time a Roman army had ever entered Asia . The decisive engagement was fought at the Battle of Magnesia , resulting in a complete Roman victory . The Seleucids sued for peace , and Rome forced them to give up their recent Greek conquests . Although they still controlled a great deal of territory , this defeat marked the decline of their empire , as they were to begin facing increasingly aggressive subjects in the east ( the Parthians ) and the west ( the Greeks ) . Their empire disintegrated into a rump over the course of the next century , when it was eclipsed by Pontus . Following Magnesia , Rome again withdrew from Greece , assuming ( or hoping ) that the lack of a major Greek power would ensure a stable peace . In fact , it did the opposite .
Atkins , a former member of Cybotron , released Model 500 " No UFOs " in 1985 , which became a regional hit , followed by dozens of tracks on Transmat , Metroplex and Fragile . One of the most unusual was " Strings of Life " by Derrick May , a darker , more intellectual strain of house . " Techno-Scratch " was released by the Knights Of The Turntable in 1984 which had a similar techno sound to Cybotron . The manager of the Factory nightclub and co-owner of the Haçienda , Tony Wilson , also promoted acid house culture on his weekly TV show . The Midlands also embraced the late 1980s house scene with illegal parties and more legal dance clubs such as The Hummingbird .
The CBC 's flagship newscast , The National , airs Sunday through Fridays at 10:00 p.m. EST and Saturdays at 6:00 p.m. EST . Until October 2006 , CBC owned-and-operated stations aired a second broadcast of the program at 11:00 p.m. ; this later broadcast included only the main news portion of the program , and excluded the analysis and documentary segment . This second airing was later replaced with other programming , and as of the 2012-13 television season , was replaced on CBC 's major market stations by a half-hour late newscast . There is also a short news update , at most , on late Saturday evenings . During hockey season , this update is usually found during the first intermission of the second game of the doubleheader on Hockey Night in Canada .
A diverse range of indigenous cultures exist in Myanmar , the majority culture is primarily Buddhist and Bamar . Bamar culture has been influenced by the cultures of neighbouring countries . This is manifested in its language , cuisine , music , dance and theatre . The arts , particularly literature , have historically been influenced by the local form of Theravada Buddhism . Considered the national epic of Myanmar , the Yama Zatdaw , an adaptation of India 's Ramayana , has been influenced greatly by Thai , Mon , and Indian versions of the play . Buddhism is practised along with nat worship , which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats .
The trial in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger in 1735 helped to establish the freedom of the press in North America . In 1754 , Columbia University was founded under charter by King George II as King 's College in Lower Manhattan . The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765 as the Sons of Liberty organized in the city , skirmishing over the next ten years with British troops stationed there .
In March 1861 , Victoria 's mother died , with Victoria at her side . Through reading her mother 's papers , Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply ; she was heart-broken , and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for " wickedly " estranging her from her mother . To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief , Albert took on most of her duties , despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble . In August , Victoria and Albert visited their son , the Prince of Wales , who was attending army manoeuvres near Dublin , and spent a few days holidaying in Killarney . In November , Albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in Ireland . Appalled , Albert travelled to Cambridge , where his son was studying , to confront him . By the beginning of December , Albert was very unwell . He was diagnosed with typhoid fever by William Jenner , and died on 14 December 1861 . Victoria was devastated . She blamed her husband 's death on worry over the Prince of Wales 's philandering . He had been " killed by that dreadful business " , she said . She entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life . She avoided public appearances , and rarely set foot in London in the following years . Her seclusion earned her the nickname " widow of Windsor " .
The Soviets also helped Germany to avoid British naval blockades by providing a submarine base , Basis Nord , in the northern Soviet Union near Murmansk . This also provided a refueling and maintenance location , and a takeoff point for raids and attacks on shipping . In addition , the Soviets provided Germany with access to the Northern Sea Route for both cargo ships and raiders ( though only the commerce raider Komet used the route before the German invasion ) , which forced Britain to protect sea lanes in both the Atlantic and the Pacific .
The FBI often works in conjunction with other Federal agencies , including the U.S. Coast Guard ( USCG ) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) in seaport and airport security , and the National Transportation Safety Board in investigating airplane crashes and other critical incidents . Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations ( ICE-HSI ) has nearly the same amount of investigative man power as the FBI , and investigates the largest range of crimes . In the wake of the September 11 attacks , then-Attorney General Ashcroft assigned the FBI as the designated lead organization in terrorism investigations after the creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security . ICE-HSI and the FBI are both integral members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force .
On 7 June 1981 , the Israeli air force destroyed Iraq 's sole nuclear reactor , in order to impede Iraq 's nuclear weapons program . The reactor was under construction just outside Baghdad . Following a series of PLO attacks in 1982 , Israel invaded Lebanon that year to destroy the bases from which the PLO launched attacks and missiles into northern Israel . In the first six days of fighting , the Israelis destroyed the military forces of the PLO in Lebanon and decisively defeated the Syrians . An Israeli government inquiry – the Kahan Commission – would later hold Begin , Sharon and several Israeli generals as indirectly responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacre . In 1985 , Israel responded to a Palestinian terrorist attack in Cyprus by bombing the PLO headquarters in Tunis . Israel withdrew from most of Lebanon in 1986 , but maintained a borderland buffer zone in southern Lebanon until 2000 , from where Israeli forces engaged in conflict with Hezbollah .
The region is serviced by 4,200 km ( 2,600 mi ) of roads used by 6 million vehicles . Train travel is well established in the Alps , with , for instance 120 km ( 75 mi ) of track for every 1,000 km2 ( 390 sq mi ) in a country such as Switzerland . Most of Europe 's highest railways are located there . Moreover , plans are underway to build a 57 km ( 35 mi ) -long sub-alpine tunnel connecting the older Lötschberg and Gotthard tunnels built in the 19th century .
Anxious to expand the company 's broadcast and cable presence , longtime MCA head Lew Wasserman sought a rich partner . He located Japanese electronics manufacturer Matsushita Electric ( now known as Panasonic ) , which agreed to acquire MCA for $ 6.6 billion in 1990 . Meanwhile , around this time , the production subsidiary was renamed Universal Studios Inc. , and ( in 1990 ) MCA created MCA/Universal Home Video Inc. for the VHS video cassette ( later DVD ) sales industry .
In December 1941 , Japan launched , in quick succession , attacks on British Malaya , the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor , and Hong Kong . Churchill 's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the empire was safe , but the manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain 's standing and prestige as an imperial power . Most damaging of all was the fall of Singapore , which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar . The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand , which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces , into closer ties with the United States . This resulted in the 1951 ANZUS Pact between Australia , New Zealand and the United States of America .
In the assembly elections held in November 2012 , the Congress secured an absolute majority . The Congress won 36 of the 68 seats while the BJP won only 26 of the 68 seats . Virbhadra Singh was sworn-in as Himachal Pradesh 's Chief Minister for a record sixth term in Shimla on 25 December 2012 . Virbhadra Singh who has held the top office in Himachal five times in the past , was administered the oath of office and secrecy by Governor Urmila Singh at an open ceremony at the historic Ridge Maidan in Shimla .
Meanwhile , in Renaissance Italy , a new period in the history of translation had opened in Florence with the arrival , at the court of Cosimo de ' Medici , of the Byzantine scholar Georgius Gemistus Pletho shortly before the fall of Constantinople to the Turks ( 1453 ) . A Latin translation of Plato 's works was undertaken by Marsilio Ficino . This and Erasmus ' Latin edition of the New Testament led to a new attitude to translation . For the first time , readers demanded rigor of rendering , as philosophical and religious beliefs depended on the exact words of Plato , Aristotle and Jesus .
As a child , young Bell displayed a natural curiosity about his world , resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age . His best friend was Ben Herdman , a neighbor whose family operated a flour mill , the scene of many forays . Young Bell asked what needed to be done at the mill . He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12 , Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes , creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years . In return , John Herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to " invent " .
Passos Coelho also announced that the retirement age will be increased from 65 to 66 , announced cuts in the pensions , unemployment benefits , health , education and science expenses , abolished the English obligatory classes in Basic Education , but kept the pensions of the judges , diplomats untouched and did n't raise the retirement age of the military and police forces . He has , however , cut meaningfully the politicians salaries . These policies have led to social unrest and to confrontations between several institutions , namely between the Government and the Constitutional Court . Several individualities belonging to the parties that support the government have also raised their voices against the policies that have been taken in order to try to solve the financial crisis .
Miami has six major causeways that span over Biscayne Bay connecting the western mainland , with the eastern barrier islands along the Atlantic Ocean . The Rickenbacker Causeway is the southernmost causeway and connects Brickell to Virginia Key and Key Biscayne . The Venetian Causeway and MacArthur Causeway connect Downtown with South Beach . The Julia Tuttle Causeway connects Midtown and Miami Beach . The 79th Street Causeway connects the Upper East Side with North Beach . The northernmost causeway , the Broad Causeway , is the smallest of Miami 's six causeways , and connects North Miami with Bal Harbour .
Egypt actively practices capital punishment . Egypt 's authorities do not release figures on death sentences and executions , despite repeated requests over the years by human rights organisations . The United Nations human rights office and various NGOs expressed " deep alarm " after an Egyptian Minya Criminal Court sentenced 529 people to death in a single hearing on 25 March 2014 . Sentenced supporters of former President Mohamed Morsi will be executed for their alleged role in violence following his ousting in July 2013 . The judgment was condemned as a violation of international law . By May 2014 , approximately 16,000 people ( and as high as more than 40,000 by one independent count ) , mostly Brotherhood members or supporters , have been imprisoned after the coup after the Muslim Brotherhood was labelled as terrorist organisation by the post-coup interim Egyptian government .
Northwestern has several housing options , including both traditional residence halls and residential colleges which gather together students who have a particular intellectual interest in common . Among the residential colleges are the Residential College of Cultural and Community Studies ( CCS ) , Ayers College of Commerce and Industry , Jones Residential College ( Arts ) , and Slivka Residential College ( Science and Engineering ) . Dorms include 1835 Hinman , Bobb-McCulloch , Foster-Walker complex ( commonly referred to as Plex ) , and several more . In Winter 2013 , 39 % of undergraduates were affiliated with a fraternity or sorority . Northwestern recognizes 21 fraternities and 18 sororities .
Iran has leading manufacturing industries in the fields of car-manufacture and transportation , construction materials , home appliances , food and agricultural goods , armaments , pharmaceuticals , information technology , power and petrochemicals in the Middle East . According to FAO , Iran has been a top five producer of the following agricultural products in the world in 2012 : apricots , cherries , sour cherries , cucumbers and gherkins , dates , eggplants , figs , pistachios , quinces , walnuts , and watermelons .
St. Barthélemy has about 25 hotels , most of them with 15 rooms or fewer . The largest has 58 rooms . Hotels are classified in the traditional French manner ; 3 Star , 4 Star and 4 Star Luxe . Of particular note are Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc . Hotel Le Toiny , the most expensive hotel on the island , has 12 rooms . Most places of accommodation are in the form of private villas , of which there are some 400 available to rent on the island . The island 's tourism industry , though expensive , attracts 70,000 visitors every year to its luxury hotels and villas and another 130,000 people arrive by luxury boats . It also attracts a labour force from Brazil and Portugal to meet the industry needs .
London 's largest industry is finance , and its financial exports make it a large contributor to the UK 's balance of payments . Around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in London until mid-2007 . London has over 480 overseas banks , more than any other city in the world . Over 85 percent ( 3.2 million ) of the employed population of greater London works in the services industries . Because of its prominent global role , London 's economy had been affected by the Late-2000s financial crisis . However , by 2010 the City has recovered ; put in place new regulatory powers , proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established London 's economic dominance . The City of London is home to the Bank of England , London Stock Exchange , and Lloyd 's of London insurance market .
The Air Force also provides Commissioned Officer Training ( COT ) for officers of all three components who are direct-commissioned to non-line positions due to their credentials in medicine , law , religion , biological sciences , or healthcare administration . Originally viewed as a " knife and fork school " that covered little beyond basic wear of the uniform , COT in recent years has been fully integrated into the OTS program and today encompasses extensive coursework as well as field exercises in leadership , confidence , fitness , and deployed-environment operations .
In 680 Ibn al-Zubayr fled Medina for Mecca . Hearing about Husayn 's opposition to Yazid I , the people of Kufa sent to Husayn asking him to take over with their support . Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him . When the news reached Yazid I , he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad , ruler of Basrah , with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn . Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him . Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa , Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa . The request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad killed Muslim bin Agail . While Ibn al-Zubayr would stay in Mecca until his death , Husayn decided to travel on to Kufa with his family , unaware of the lack of support there . Husayn and his family were intercepted by Yazid I 's forces led by Amru bin Saad , Shamar bin Thi Al-Joshan , and Hussain bin Tamim , who fought Al-Husayn and his male family members until they were killed . There were 200 people in Husayn 's caravan , many of whom were women , including his sisters , wives , daughters and their children . The women and children from Husayn 's camp were taken as prisoners of war and led back to Damascus to be presented to Yazid I . They remained imprisoned until public opinion turned against him as word of Husayn 's death and his family 's capture spread . They were then granted passage back to Medina . The sole adult male survivor from the caravan was Ali ibn Husayn who was with fever too ill to fight when the caravan was attacked .
On 23 February , the 28th Marine Regiment reached the summit of Suribachi , prompting the now famous Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima picture . Navy Secretary James Forrestal , upon seeing the flag , remarked " there will be a Marine Corps for the next 500 years . " The flag raising is often cited as the most reproduced photograph of all time and became the archetypal representation not only of that battle , but of the entire Pacific War . For the rest of February , the Americans pushed north , and by 1 March , had taken two-thirds of the island . But it was not until 26 March that the island was finally secured . The Japanese fought to the last man , killing 6,800 Marines and wounding nearly 20,000 more . The Japanese losses totaled well over 20,000 men killed , and only 1,083 prisoners were taken . Historians debate whether it was strategically worth the casualties sustained .
The band , now revitalised by the response to Live Aid – a " shot in the arm " Roger Taylor called it , — and the ensuing increase in record sales , ended 1985 by releasing the single " One Vision " , which was the third time after " Stone Cold Crazy " and " Under Pressure ( with David Bowie ) " that all four bandmembers received a writing credit for the one song . Also , a limited-edition boxed set containing all Queen albums to date was released under the title of The Complete Works . The package included previously unreleased material , most notably Queen 's non-album single of Christmas 1984 , titled " Thank God It 's Christmas " .
The pro-decolonisation Labour government , elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee , moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire : that of Indian independence . India 's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades , but disagreed as to how it should be implemented . Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state , whereas the League , fearing domination by the Hindu majority , desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions . Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948 . When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent , the newly appointed ( and last ) Viceroy , Lord Mountbatten , hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947 . The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan . Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa , and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives . Burma , which had been administered as part of the British Raj , and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948 . India , Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth , while Burma chose not to join .
A recent addition to the exhibition is the late 13th-century Westminster Retable , England 's oldest altarpiece , which was most probably designed for the high altar of the abbey . Although it has been damaged in past centuries , the panel has been expertly cleaned and conserved .
Other Christian denominations on the island include : Roman Catholic ( since 1852 ) , Salvation Army ( since 1884 ) , Baptist ( since 1845 ) and , in more recent times , Seventh-day Adventist ( since 1949 ) , New Apostolic and Jehovah 's Witnesses ( of which one in 35 residents is a member , the highest ratio of any country ) . The Catholics are pastorally served by the Mission sui iuris of Saint Helena , Ascension and Tristan da Cunha , whose office of ecclesiastical superior is vested in the Apostolic Prefecture of the Falkland Islands .
During her grandfather 's reign , Elizabeth was third in the line of succession to the throne , behind her uncle Edward , Prince of Wales , and her father , the Duke of York . Although her birth generated public interest , she was not expected to become queen , as the Prince of Wales was still young , and many assumed that he would marry and have children of his own . When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII , she became second-in-line to the throne , after her father . Later that year Edward abdicated , after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis . Consequently , Elizabeth 's father became king , and she became heir presumptive . If her parents had had a later son , she would have lost her position as first-in-line , as her brother would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession .
Ibn Sina ( Avicenna ) is regarded as the most influential philosopher of Islam . He pioneered the science of experimental medicine and was the first physician to conduct clinical trials . His two most notable works in medicine are the Kitāb al-shifāʾ ( " Book of Healing " ) and The Canon of Medicine , both of which were used as standard medicinal texts in both the Muslim world and in Europe well into the 17th century . Amongst his many contributions are the discovery of the contagious nature of infectious diseases , and the introduction of clinical pharmacology .
After working for many years at the University of Chicago , Arthur Holly Compton returned to St. Louis in 1946 to serve as Washington University 's ninth chancellor . Compton reestablished the Washington University football team , making the declaration that athletics were to be henceforth played on a " strictly amateur " basis with no athletic scholarships . Under Compton’s leadership , enrollment at the University grew dramatically , fueled primarily by World War II veterans ' use of their GI Bill benefits .
Cities not served by road , sea , or river can be reached only by air , foot , dogsled , or snowmachine , accounting for Alaska 's extremely well developed bush air services—an Alaskan novelty . Anchorage and , to a lesser extent Fairbanks , is served by many major airlines . Because of limited highway access , air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state . Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism ( in 2012-2013 , Alaska received almost 2 million visitors ) .
By September 2008 , average U.S. housing prices had declined by over 20 % from their mid-2006 peak . As prices declined , borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages could not refinance to avoid the higher payments associated with rising interest rates and began to default . During 2007 , lenders began foreclosure proceedings on nearly 1.3 million properties , a 79 % increase over 2006 . This increased to 2.3 million in 2008 , an 81 % increase vs. 2007 . By August 2008 , 9.2 % of all U.S. mortgages outstanding were either delinquent or in foreclosure . By September 2009 , this had risen to 14.4 % .
On May 16 , rescue groups from South Korea , Japan , Singapore , Russia and Taiwan arrived to join the rescue effort . The United States shared some of its satellite images of the quake-stricken areas with Chinese authorities . During the weekend , the US sent into China two U.S. Air Force C-17 's carrying supplies , which included tents and generators . Xinhua reported 135,000 Chinese troops and medics were involved in the rescue effort across 58 counties and cities .
In 2005 , Estonia joined the European Union 's Nordic Battle Group . It has also shown continued interest in joining the Nordic Council . Whereas in 1992 Russia accounted for 92 % of Estonia 's international trade , today there is extensive economic interdependence between Estonia and its Nordic neighbours : three quarters of foreign investment in Estonia originates in the Nordic countries ( principally Finland and Sweden ) , to which Estonia sends 42 % of its exports ( as compared to 6.5 % going to Russia , 8.8 % to Latvia , and 4.7 % to Lithuania ) . On the other hand , the Estonian political system , its flat rate of income tax , and its non-welfare-state model distinguish it from the Nordic countries and their Nordic model , and indeed from many other European countries .
On 9 July 2006 , during Mass at Valencia 's Cathedral , Our Lady of the Forsaken Basilica , Pope Benedict XVI used , at the World Day of Families , the Santo Caliz , a 1st-century Middle-Eastern artifact that some Catholics believe is the Holy Grail . It was supposedly brought to that church by Emperor Valerian in the 3rd century , after having been brought by St. Peter to Rome from Jerusalem . The Santo Caliz ( Holy Chalice ) is a simple , small stone cup . Its base was added in Medieval Times and consists of fine gold , alabaster and gem stones .
The Saxon and Austrian armies were unprepared , and their forces were scattered . Frederick occupied Dresden with little or no opposition from the Saxons . At the Battle of Lobositz on 1 October 1756 , Frederick prevented the isolated Saxon army from being reinforced by an Austrian army under General Browne . The Prussians then occupied Saxony ; after the Siege of Pirna , the Saxon army surrendered in October 1756 , and was forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army . The attack on neutral Saxony caused outrage across Europe and led to the strengthening of the anti-Prussian coalition . The only significant Austrian success was the partial occupation of Silesia . Far from being easy , Frederick 's early successes proved indecisive and very costly for Prussia 's smaller army . This led him to remark that he did not fight the same Austrians as he had during the previous war .
Code 127 is officially named " delete " but the Teletype label was " rubout " . Since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes , interpretations of this code varied . The original Teletype meaning , and the intent of the standard , was to make it an ignored character , the same as NUL ( all zeroes ) . This was useful specifically for paper tape , because punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it . Tapes designed to be " hand edited " could even be produced with spaces of extra NULs ( blank tape ) so that a block of characters could be " rubbed out " and then replacements put into the empty space .
On December 25 , 1991 , following the collapse of the Soviet Union , the republic was renamed the Russian Federation , which it remains to this day . This name and " Russia " were specified as the official state names in the April 21 , 1992 amendment to the existing constitution and were retained as such in the 1993 Constitution of Russia .
For collectable or nostalgia purposes , or for the benefit of higher-quality audio playback provided by the 78 rpm speed with newer vinyl records and their lightweight stylus pickups , a small number of 78 rpm records have been released since the major labels ceased production . One of the first attempts at this was in the 1950s , when inventor Ewing Dunbar Nunn founded the label Audiophile Records , which released , in addition to standard 33 1/3 rpm LPs , 78 rpm-mastered albums that were microgroove and pressed on vinyl ( as opposed to traditional 78s , with their shellac composition and wider 3-mil sized grooves ) . This was done by the label mainly to take advantage of the wider audio frequency response that faster speeds like 78 rpm can provide for vinyl microgroove records , hence the label 's name ( obviously catering to the audiophiles of the 1950s " hi-fi " era , when stereo gear could provide a much wider range of audio than before ) . Also in the late 1950s , Bell Records released a few budget-priced 7 " microgrooved records at 78 rpm .
The Rambla is an avenue that goes along the entire coastline of Montevideo . The literal meaning of the Spanish word rambla is " avenue " or " watercourse " , but in the Americas it is mostly used as " coastal avenue " , and since all the southern departments of Uruguay border either the Río de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean , they all have ramblas as well . As an integral part of Montevidean identity , the Rambla has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of World Heritage sites , though it has not received this status . Previously , the entire Rambla was called Rambla Naciones Unidas ( " United Nations " ) , but in recent times different names have been given to specific parts of it .

Hellenistic warfare was a continuation of the military developments of Iphicrates and Philip II of Macedon , particularly his use of the Macedonian Phalanx , a dense formation of pikemen , in conjunction with heavy companion cavalry . Armies of the Hellenistic period differed from those of the classical period in being largely made up of professional soldiers and also in their greater specialization and technical proficiency in siege warfare . Hellenistic armies were significantly larger than those of classical Greece relying increasingly on Greek mercenaries ( misthophoroi ; men-for-pay ) and also on non-Greek soldiery such as Thracians , Galatians , Egyptians and Iranians . Some ethnic groups were known for their martial skill in a particular mode of combat and were highly sought after , including Tarantine cavalry , Cretan archers , Rhodian slingers and Thracian peltasts . This period also saw the adoption of new weapons and troop types such as Thureophoroi and the Thorakitai who used the oval Thureos shield and fought with javelins and the machaira sword . The use of heavily armored cataphracts and also horse archers was adopted by the Seleucids , Greco-Bactrians , Armenians and Pontus . The use of war elephants also became common . Seleucus received Indian war elephants from the Mauryan empire , and used them to good effect at the battle of Ipsus . He kept a core of 500 of them at Apameia . The Ptolemies used the smaller African elephant .
For instance , if a transmitter delivers 100 W into an antenna having an efficiency of 80 % , then the antenna will radiate 80 W as radio waves and produce 20 W of heat . In order to radiate 100 W of power , one would need to use a transmitter capable of supplying 125 W to the antenna . Note that antenna efficiency is a separate issue from impedance matching , which may also reduce the amount of power radiated using a given transmitter . If an SWR meter reads 150 W of incident power and 50 W of reflected power , that means that 100 W have actually been absorbed by the antenna ( ignoring transmission line losses ) . How much of that power has actually been radiated can not be directly determined through electrical measurements at ( or before ) the antenna terminals , but would require ( for instance ) careful measurement of field strength . Fortunately the loss resistance of antenna conductors such as aluminum rods can be calculated and the efficiency of an antenna using such materials predicted .
Nick Fradiani won the season , defeating Clark Beckham . By winning , Fradiani became the first winner from the Northeast region . Fradiani released " Beautiful Life " as his coronation single while Beckham released " Champion " . Jax , the third place finalist , also released a single called " Forcefield " .
Louis XIV distrusted the Parisians and moved his court to Versailles in 1682 , but his reign also saw an unprecedented flourishing of the arts and sciences in Paris . The Comédie-Française , the Academy of Painting , and the French Academy of Sciences were founded and made their headquarters in the city . To show that the city was safe against attack , he had the city walls demolished , replacing them with Grands Boulevards . To leave monuments to his reign , he built the Collège des Quatre-Nations , Place Vendôme , Place des Victoires , and began Les Invalides .
After Christianization , the Roman Catholic Church and local rulers led German expansion and settlement in areas inhabited by Slavs and Balts , known as Ostsiedlung . During the wars waged in the Baltic by the Catholic German Teutonic Knights ; the lands inhabited by the ethnic group of the Old Prussians ( the current reference to the people known then simply as the " Prussians " ) , were conquered by the Germans . The Old Prussians were an ethnic group related to the Latvian and Lithuanian Baltic peoples . The former German state of Prussia took its name from the Baltic Prussians , although it was led by Germans who had assimilated the Old Prussians ; the old Prussian language was extinct by the 17th or early 18th century . The Slavic people of the Teutonic-controlled Baltic were assimilated into German culture and eventually there were many intermarriages of Slavic and German families , including amongst the Prussia 's aristocracy known as the Junkers . Prussian military strategist Karl von Clausewitz is a famous German whose surname is of Slavic origin . Massive German settlement led to the assimilation of Baltic ( Old Prussians ) and Slavic ( Wends ) populations , who were exhausted by previous warfare .
The Victorian era of the United Kingdom was the period of Queen Victoria 's reign from June 1837 to January 1901 . This was a long period of prosperity for the British people , as profits gained from the overseas British Empire , as well as from industrial improvements at home , allowed a large , educated middle class to develop . Some scholars would extend the beginning of the period—as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political games that have come to be associated with the Victorians—back five years to the passage of the Reform Act 1832 .
During the NES era , Nintendo maintained exclusive control over titles released for the system—the company had to approve every game , each third-party developer could only release up to five games per year ( but some third parties got around this by using different names , for example Konami 's " Ultra Games " brand ) , those games could not be released on another console within two years , and Nintendo was the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of NES cartridges . However , competition from Sega 's console brought an end to this practice ; in 1991 , Acclaim began releasing games for both platforms , with most of Nintendo 's other licensees following suit over the next several years ; Capcom ( which licensed some games to Sega instead of producing them directly ) and Square were the most notable holdouts .
In 2010 and 2011 , state and federal funds were awarded to Connecticut ( and Massachusetts ) to construct the Hartford Line , with a southern terminus at New Haven 's Union Station and a northern terminus at Springfield 's Union Station . According to the White House , " This corridor [ currently ] has one train per day connecting communities in Connecticut and Massachusetts to the Northeast Corridor and Vermont . The vision for this corridor is to restore the alignment to its original route via the Knowledge Corridor in western Massachusetts , improving trip time and increasing the population base that can be served . " Set for construction in 2013 , the " Knowledge Corridor high speed intercity passenger rail " project will cost approximately $ 1 billion , and the ultimate northern terminus for the project is reported to be Montreal in Canada . Train speeds between will reportedly exceed 110 miles per hour ( 180 km/h ) and increase both cities ' rail traffic exponentially .
Philadelphia artists have had a prominent national role in popular music . In the 1970s , Philadelphia soul influenced the music of that and later eras . On July 13 , 1985 , Philadelphia hosted the American end of the Live Aid concert at John F. Kennedy Stadium . The city reprised this role for the Live 8 concert , bringing some 700,000 people to the Ben Franklin Parkway on July 2 , 2005 . Philadelphia is home to the world-renowned Philadelphia Boys Choir & Chorale , which has performed its music all over the world . Dr. Robert G. Hamilton , founder of the choir , is a notable native Philadelphian . The Philly Pops is another famous Philadelphia music group . The city has played a major role in the development and support of American rock music and rap music . Hip-hop/Rap artists such as The Roots , DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince , The Goats , Freeway , Schoolly D , Eve , and Lisa " Left Eye " Lopes hail from the city .
Both the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira have a subtropical climate , although variations between islands exist , making weather predictions very difficult ( owing to rough topography ) . The Madeira and Azorean archipelagos have a narrower temperature range , with annual average temperatures exceeding 20 °C ( 68 °F ) along the coast ( according to the Portuguese Meteorological Institute ) . Some islands in Azores do have drier months in the summer . Consequently , the island of the Azores have been identified as having a Mediterranean climate ( both Csa and Csb types ) , while some islands ( such as Flores or Corvo ) are classified as Maritime Temperate ( Cfb ) and Humid subtropical ( Cfa ) , respectively , according to Köppen-Geiger classification .
Little is known about the bacteria that degrade cellulose . Symbiotic bacteria in Xylophaga may play a role in the degradation of sunken wood ; while bacteria such as Alphaproteobacteria , Flavobacteria , Actinobacteria , Clostridia , and Bacteroidetes have been detected in wood submerged over a year .
After dynastic quarrels however , there was a Christian reconquest in 1072 . The family who returned the city to Christianity were called the Hautevilles , including Robert Guiscard and his army , who is regarded as a hero by the natives . It was under Roger II of Sicily that Norman holdings in Sicily and the southern part of the Italian Peninsula were promoted from the County of Sicily into the Kingdom of Sicily . The Kingdom 's capital was Palermo , with the King 's Court held at the Palazzo dei Normanni . Much construction was undertaken during this period , such as the building of Palermo Cathedral . The Kingdom of Sicily became one of the wealthiest states in Europe .
The initial military maneuvers began in September 1806 . In a notable letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign , Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carré ( 'square battalion ' ) . In the bataillon-carré system , the various corps of the Grande Armée would march uniformly together in close supporting distance . If any single corps was attacked , the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help . Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops , rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale . As in previous campaigns , his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war . Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army , the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force . At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt , fought on 14 October , the French convincingly defeated the Prussians and inflicted heavy casualties . With several major commanders dead or incapacitated , the Prussian king proved incapable of effectively commanding the army , which began to quickly disintegrate . In a vaunted pursuit that epitomized the " peak of Napoleonic warfare , " according to historian Richard Brooks , the French managed to capture 140,000 soldiers , over 2,000 cannons and hundreds of ammunition wagons , all in a single month . Historian David Chandler wrote of the Prussian forces : " Never has the morale of any army been more completely shattered . " Despite their overwhelming defeat , the Prussians refused to negotiate with the French until the Russians had an opportunity to enter the fight .
In 1852 , Elisha Otis introduced the safety elevator , which prevented the fall of the cab if the cable broke . The design of the Otis safety elevator is somewhat similar to one type still used today . A governor device engages knurled roller ( s ) , locking the elevator to its guides should the elevator descend at excessive speed . He demonstrated it at the New York exposition in the Crystal Palace in a dramatic , death-defying presentation in 1854 , and the first such passenger elevator was installed at 488 Broadway in New York City on March 23 , 1857 .
In response , the EU decided to fill the gap left behind by the US under the Sandbaek report . According to its Annual Report for 2008 , the UNFPA received its funding mainly from European Governments : Of the total income of M845.3 M , $ 118 was donated by the Netherlands , $ 67 M by Sweden , $ 62 M by Norway , $ 54 M by Denmark , $ 53 M by the UK , $ 52 M by Spain , $ 19 M by Luxembourg . The European Commission donated further $ 36 M. The most important non-European donor State was Japan ( $ 36 M ) . The number of donors exceeded 180 in one year .
There has been an increasing gulf between the Premier League and the Football League . Since its split with the Football League , many established clubs in the Premier League have managed to distance themselves from their counterparts in lower leagues . Owing in large part to the disparity in revenue from television rights between the leagues , many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in the Premier League . In every season except 2001–02 and 2011–12 , at least one Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League . In 1997–98 all three promoted clubs were relegated at the end of the season .
Prior to the 12th century , women accounted for less than one percent of the world’s Islamic scholars . However , al-Sakhawi and Mohammad Akram Nadwi have since found evidence of over 8,000 female scholars since the 15th century . al-Sakhawi devotes an entire volume of his 12-volume biographical dictionary al-Ḍawʾ al-lāmiʻ to female scholars , giving information on 1,075 of them . More recently , the scholar Mohammad Akram Nadwi , currently a researcher from the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies , has written 40 volumes on the muḥaddithāt ( the women scholars of ḥadīth ) , and found at least 8,000 of them .
On 14 June 1925 , in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera 's dictatorship , the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March . As a reprisal , the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club . This coincided with the transition to professional football , and , in 1926 , the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed , for the first time , to operate a professional football club . On 3 July 1927 , the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara , against the Spanish national team . To kick off the match , local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his airplane . In 1928 , victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled " Oda a Platko " , which was written by a member of the Generation of '27 , Rafael Alberti , inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper , Franz Platko . On 23 June 1929 , Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League . A year after winning the championship , on 30 July 1930 , Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems .
Within each province are communities ( hamaynkner , singular hamaynk ) . Each community is self-governing and consists of one or more settlements ( bnakavayrer , singular bnakavayr ) . Settlements are classified as either towns ( kaghakner , singular kaghak ) or villages ( gyugher , singular gyugh ) . As of 2007 [ update ] , Armenia includes 915 communities , of which 49 are considered urban and 866 are considered rural . The capital , Yerevan , also has the status of a community . Additionally , Yerevan is divided into twelve semi-autonomous districts .
The word " dollar " is one of the words in the first paragraph of Section 9 of Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution . In that context , " dollars " is a reference to the Spanish milled dollar , a coin that had a monetary value of 8 Spanish units of currency , or reales . In 1792 the U.S. Congress adopted legislation titled An act establishing a mint , and regulating the Coins of the United States . Section 9 of that act authorized the production of various coins , including " DOLLARS OR UNITS—each to be of the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current , and to contain three hundred and seventy-one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure , or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver " . Section 20 of the act provided , " That the money of account of the United States shall be expressed in dollars , or units ... and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the United States shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation " . In other words , this act designated the United States dollar as the unit of currency of the United States .
To the extent that Italy held the territory by UN mandate , the trusteeship provisions gave the Somalis the opportunity to gain experience in political education and self-government . These were advantages that British Somaliland , which was to be incorporated into the new Somali state , did not have . Although in the 1950s British colonial officials attempted , through various administrative development efforts , to make up for past neglect , the protectorate stagnated . The disparity between the two territories in economic development and political experience would cause serious difficulties when it came time to integrate the two parts . Meanwhile , in 1948 , under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of the Somalis , the British " returned " the Haud ( an important Somali grazing area that was presumably 'protected ' by British treaties with the Somalis in 1884 and 1886 ) and the Ogaden to Ethiopia , based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which the British ceded Somali territory to the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik in exchange for his help against plundering by Somali clans . Britain included the proviso that the Somali nomads would retain their autonomy , but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over them . This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands it had turned over . Britain also granted administration of the almost exclusively Somali-inhabited Northern Frontier District ( NFD ) to Kenyan nationalists despite an informal plebiscite demonstrating the overwhelming desire of the region 's population to join the newly formed Somali Republic .
The outreach director of HRTR , Susan Prager , is also the communication director of " Friends of Falun Gong " , a quasi-government non-profit funded by fmr . Congressman Tom Lanto 's wife and Ambassador Mark Palmer of NED . A major setback to the event was caused by footballer Diego Maradona , scheduled to open the relay through Buenos Aires , pulling out in an attempt to avoid the Olympic controversy . Trying to avoid the scenes that marred the relay in the UK , France and the US , the city government designed a complex security operative to protect the torch relay , involving 1200 police officers and 3000 other people , including public employees and volunteers . Overall , the protests were peaceful in nature , although there were a few incidents such as the throwing of several water balloons in an attempt to extinguish the Olympic flame , and minor scuffles between Olympic protesters and supporters from Chinese immigrant communities .
Another civil war ensued after the death of Karim Khan in 1779 , out of which Aqa Mohammad Khan emerged , founding the Qajar Dynasty in 1794 . In 1795 , following the disobedience of the Georgian subjects and their alliance with the Russians , the Qajars captured Tblisi by the Battle of Krtsanisi , and drove the Russians out of the entire Caucasus , reestablishing a short-lived Iranian suzerainty over the region . The Russo-Persian wars of 1804–1813 and 1826–1828 resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for Iran in the Caucasus , comprising all of Transcaucasia and Dagestan , which made part of the very concept of Iran for centuries , and thus substantial gains for the neighboring Russian Empire .
Pascal Lissouba , who became Congo 's first elected president ( 1992–1997 ) during the period of multi-party democracy , attempted to implement economic reforms with IMF backing to liberalise the economy . In June 1996 the IMF approved a three-year SDR69.5m ( US $ 100m ) enhanced structural adjustment facility ( ESAF ) and was on the verge of announcing a renewed annual agreement when civil war broke out in Congo in mid-1997 .
The country was controlled by a revolutionary council until 1984 . The first multi-party elections were held in 1994 . An army uprising in May 1998 led to the Guinea-Bissau Civil War and the president 's ousting in June 1999 . Elections were held again in 2000 , and Kumba Ialá was elected president .
Initially , officials were unable to contact the Wolong National Nature Reserve , home to around 280 giant pandas . However , the Foreign Ministry later said that a group of 31 British tourists visiting the Wolong Panda Reserve in the quake-hit area returned safe and uninjured to Chengdu . Nonetheless , the well-being of an even greater number of pandas in the neighbouring panda reserves remained unknown . Five security guards at the reserve were killed by the earthquake . Six pandas escaped after their enclosures were damaged . By May 20 , two pandas at the reserve were found to be injured , while the search continued for another two adult pandas that went missing after the quake . By May 28 , 2008 , one panda was still missing . The missing panda was later found dead under the rubble of an enclosure . Nine-year-old Mao Mao , a mother of five at the breeding center , was discovered on Monday , her body crushed by a wall in her enclosure . Panda keepers and other workers placed her remains in a small wooden crate and buried her outside the breeding centre .
Wang , Štrkalj et al . ( 2003 ) examined the use of race as a biological concept in research papers published in China 's only biological anthropology journal , Acta Anthropologica Sinica . The study showed that the race concept was widely used among Chinese anthropologists . In a 2007 review paper , Štrkalj suggested that the stark contrast of the racial approach between the United States and China was due to the fact that race is a factor for social cohesion among the ethnically diverse people of China , whereas " race " is a very sensitive issue in America and the racial approach is considered to undermine social cohesion - with the result that in the socio-political context of US academics scientists are encouraged not to use racial categories , whereas in China they are encouraged to use them .
Inflammatory diarrhea occurs when there is damage to the mucosal lining or brush border , which leads to a passive loss of protein-rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids . Features of all three of the other types of diarrhea [ clarification needed ] can be found in this type of diarrhea . It can be caused by bacterial infections , viral infections , parasitic infections , or autoimmune problems such as inflammatory bowel diseases . It can also be caused by tuberculosis , colon cancer , and enteritis . [ citation needed ]
The apartheid bureaucracy devised complex ( and often arbitrary ) criteria in the Population Registration Act of 1945 to determine who belonged in which group . Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications . When it was unclear from a person 's physical appearance whether the individual should be considered Coloured or Black , the " pencil test " was used . A pencil was inserted into a person 's hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough to hold the pencil , rather than having it pass through , as it would with smoother hair . If so , the person was classified as Black . Such classifications sometimes divided families .
Japan conscripted many soldiers from its colonies of Korea and Formosa ( Taiwan ) . To a small extent , some Vichy French , Indian National Army , and Burmese National Army forces were active in the area of the Pacific War . Collaborationist units from Hong Kong ( reformed ex-colonial police ) , Philippines , Dutch East Indies ( the PETA ) and Dutch Guinea , British Malaya and British Borneo , Inner Mongolia and former French Indochina ( after the overthrow of Vichy French regime ) as well as Timorese militia also assisted Japanese war efforts .
The club 's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James , and surrounded by two branches , one of a laurel tree and the other a palm . In 1910 the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest . The winner was Carles Comamala , who at the time played for the club . Comamala 's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today , with some minor variations . The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it , and the team colours at the bottom .
Paris ' urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century , particularly where street-front alignment , building height and building distribution is concerned . In recent developments , a 1974-2010 building height limitation of 37 metres ( 121 ft ) was raised to 50 m ( 160 ft ) in central areas and 180 metres ( 590 ft ) in some of Paris ' peripheral quarters , yet for some of the city 's more central quarters , even older building-height laws still remain in effect . The 210 metres ( 690 ft ) Montparnasse tower was both Paris and France 's tallest building until 1973 , but this record has been held by the La Défense quarter Tour First tower in Courbevoie since its 2011 construction . A new project for La Defense , called Hermitage Plaza , launched in 2009 , proposes to build two towers , 85 and 86 stories or 320 metres high , which would be the tallest buildings in the European Union , just slightly shorter than the Eiffel Tower . They were scheduled for completion in 2019 or 2020 , but as of January 2015 construction had not yet begun , and there were questions in the press about the future of the project .
As an example , Santiago de Compostela , the political capital city , has an average of 129 rainy days and 1,362 millimetres ( 53.6 in ) per year ( with just 17 rainy days in the three summer months ) and 2,101 sunlight hours per year , with just 6 days with frosts per year . But the colder city of Lugo , to the east , has an average of 1,759 sunlight hours per year , 117 days with precipitations ( > 1 mm ) totalling 901.54 millimetres ( 35.5 in ) , and 40 days with frosts per year . The more mountainous parts of the provinces of Ourense and Lugo receive significant snowfall during the winter months . The sunniest city is Pontevedra with 2,223 sunny hours per year .
Passenger elevators capacity is related to the available floor space . Generally passenger elevators are available in capacities from 500 to 2,700 kg ( 1,000–6,000 lb ) in 230 kg ( 500 lb ) increments . [ citation needed ] Generally passenger elevators in buildings of eight floors or fewer are hydraulic or electric , which can reach speeds up to 1 m/s ( 200 ft/min ) hydraulic and up to 152 m/min ( 500 ft/min ) electric . In buildings up to ten floors , electric and gearless elevators are likely to have speeds up to 3 m/s ( 500 ft/min ) , and above ten floors speeds range 3 to 10 m/s ( 500–2,000 ft/min ) .

Cardinal Augustin Bea , the head of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity , added at the end of the visit , " Let us move forward in Christ . God wants it . Humanity is waiting for it . " Unmoved by a harsh condemnation by the Congregation of Faith on mixed marriages precisely at this time of the visit , Paul VI and Ramsey appointed a preparatory commission which was to put the common agenda into practice on such issues as mixed marriages . This resulted in a joint Malta declaration , the first joint agreement on the Creed since the Reformation . Paul VI was a good friend of the Anglican Church , which he described as " our beloved sister Church " . This description was unique to Paul and not used by later popes .
The growth , development , and reproduction of organisms relies on cell division , or the process by which a single cell divides into two usually identical daughter cells . This requires first making a duplicate copy of every gene in the genome in a process called DNA replication . :5.2 The copies are made by specialized enzymes known as DNA polymerases , which " read " one strand of the double-helical DNA , known as the template strand , and synthesize a new complementary strand . Because the DNA double helix is held together by base pairing , the sequence of one strand completely specifies the sequence of its complement ; hence only one strand needs to be read by the enzyme to produce a faithful copy . The process of DNA replication is semiconservative ; that is , the copy of the genome inherited by each daughter cell contains one original and one newly synthesized strand of DNA . :5.2
At the time of her accession , the government was led by the Whig prime minister Lord Melbourne , who at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced Queen , who relied on him for advice . Charles Greville supposed that the widowed and childless Melbourne was " passionately fond of her as he might be of his daughter if he had one " , and Victoria probably saw him as a father figure . Her coronation took place on 28 June 1838 at Westminster Abbey . Over 400,000 visitors came to London for the celebrations . She became the first sovereign to take up residence at Buckingham Palace and inherited the revenues of the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall as well as being granted a civil list allowance of £385,000 per year . Financially prudent , she paid off her father 's debts .
Hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals . Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice . These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks , but the gas 's high solubility is a metallurgical problem , contributing to the embrittlement of many metals , complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks .
Opponents argue that the death penalty is not an effective means of deterring crime , risks the execution of the innocent , is unnecessarily barbaric in nature , cheapens human life , and puts a government on the same base moral level as those criminals involved in murder . Furthermore , some opponents argue that the arbitrariness with which it is administered and the systemic influence of racial , socio-economic , geographic , and gender bias on determinations of desert make the current practice of capital punishment immoral and illegitimate .
Due to reciprocity ( discussed above ) the gain of an antenna used for transmitting must be proportional to its effective area when used for receiving . Consider an antenna with no loss , that is , one whose electrical efficiency is 100 % . It can be shown that its effective area averaged over all directions must be equal to λ2/4π , the wavelength squared divided by 4π . Gain is defined such that the average gain over all directions for an antenna with 100 % electrical efficiency is equal to 1 . Therefore , the effective area Aeff in terms of the gain G in a given direction is given by :
There have been instances where a country 's government bans a movie , resulting in the spread of copied videos and DVDs . Romanian-born documentary maker Ilinca Calugareanu wrote a New York Times article telling the story of Irina Margareta Nistor , a narrator for state TV under Nicolae Ceauşescu 's regime . A visitor from the west gave her bootlegged copies of American movies , which she dubbed for secret viewings through Romania . According to the article , she dubbed more than 3,000 movies and became the country 's second-most famous voice after Ceauşescu , even though no one knew her name until many years later .
Most of the subcontinent was conquered by the Maurya Empire during the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE . From the 3rd century BC onwards Prakrit and Pali literature in the north and the Sangam literature in southern India started to flourish . Wootz steel originated in south India in the 3rd century BC and was exported to foreign countries . Various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties for the next 1,500 years , among which the Gupta Empire stands out . This period , witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence , is known as the classical or " Golden Age of India " . During this period , aspects of Indian civilization , administration , culture , and religion ( Hinduism and Buddhism ) spread to much of Asia , while kingdoms in southern India had maritime business links with the Roman Empire from around 77 CE . Indian cultural influence spread over many parts of Southeast Asia which led to the establishment of Indianized kingdoms in Southeast Asia ( Greater India ) .
There is some evidence , in the form of ice cores drilled to about 400 m ( 1,300 ft ) above the water line , that Lake Vostok 's waters may contain microbial life . The frozen surface of the lake shares similarities with Jupiter 's moon , Europa . If life is discovered in Lake Vostok , it would strengthen the argument for the possibility of life on Europa . On 7 February 2008 , a NASA team embarked on a mission to Lake Untersee , searching for extremophiles in its highly alkaline waters . If found , these resilient creatures could further bolster the argument for extraterrestrial life in extremely cold , methane-rich environments .
Osmotic diarrhea occurs when too much water is drawn into the bowels . If a person drinks solutions with excessive sugar or excessive salt , these can draw water from the body into the bowel and cause osmotic diarrhea . Osmotic diarrhea can also be the result of maldigestion ( e.g. , pancreatic disease or Coeliac disease ) , in which the nutrients are left in the lumen to pull in water . Or it can be caused by osmotic laxatives ( which work to alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels ) . In healthy individuals , too much magnesium or vitamin C or undigested lactose can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel . A person who has lactose intolerance can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products . In persons who have fructose malabsorption , excess fructose intake can also cause diarrhea . High-fructose foods that also have a high glucose content are more absorbable and less likely to cause diarrhea . Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol ( often found in sugar-free foods ) are difficult for the body to absorb and , in large amounts , may lead to osmotic diarrhea . In most of these cases , osmotic diarrhea stops when offending agent ( e.g . milk , sorbitol ) is stopped .
Film speed is used in the exposure equations to find the appropriate exposure parameters . Four variables are available to the photographer to obtain the desired effect : lighting , film speed , f-number ( aperture size ) , and shutter speed ( exposure time ) . The equation may be expressed as ratios , or , by taking the logarithm ( base 2 ) of both sides , by addition , using the APEX system , in which every increment of 1 is a doubling of exposure ; this increment is commonly known as a " stop " . The effective f-number is proportional to the ratio between the lens focal length and aperture diameter , the diameter itself being proportional to the square root of the aperture area . Thus , a lens set to f/1.4 allows twice as much light to strike the focal plane as a lens set to f/2 . Therefore , each f-number factor of the square root of two ( approximately 1.4 ) is also a stop , so lenses are typically marked in that progression : f/1.4 , 2 , 2.8 , 4 , 5.6 , 8 , 11 , 16 , 22 , 32 , etc .
The Roman legions first entered the area under Decimus Junius Brutus in 137–136 BC , but the country was only incorporated into the Roman Empire by the time of Augustus ( 29 BC – 19 BC ) . The Romans were interested in Galicia mainly for its mineral resources , most notably gold . Under Roman rule , most Galician hillforts began to be – sometimes forcibly – abandoned , and Gallaeci served frequently in the Roman army as auxiliary troops . Romans brought new technologies , new travel routes , new forms of organizing property , and a new language ; latin . The Roman Empire established its control over Galicia through camps ( castra ) as Aquis Querquennis , Ciadella camp or Lucus Augusti ( Lugo ) , roads ( viae ) and monuments as the lighthouse known as Tower of Hercules , in Corunna , but the remoteness and lesser interest of the country since the 2nd century of our era , when the gold mines stopped being productive , led to a lesser degree of Romanization . In the 3rd century it was made a province , under the name Gallaecia , which included also northern Portugal , Asturias , and a large section of what today is known as Castile and León .
Northwestern was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1917 and remains a research university with " very high " research activity . Northwestern 's schools of management , engineering , and communication are among the most academically productive in the nation . Northwestern received $ 550 million in research funding in 2014 . Northwestern supports nearly 1,500 research laboratories across two campuses , predominately in the medical and biological sciences . Through the Innovation and New Ventures Office ( INVO ) , Northwestern researchers disclosed 247 inventions , filed 270 patents applications , received 81 foreign and US patents , started 12 companies , and generated $ 79.8 million in licensing revenue in 2013 . The bulk of revenue has come from a patent on pregabalin , a synthesized organic molecule discovered by chemistry professor Richard Silverman , which ultimately was marketed as Lyrica , a drug sold by Pfizer , to combat epilepsy , neuropathic pain , and fibromyalgia . INVO has been involved in creating a number of centers , including the Center for Developmental Therapeutics ( CDT ) and the Center for Device Development ( CD2 ) . It has also helped form over 50 Northwestern startup companies based on Northwestern technologies .
The 18th century saw a huge growth in the number of drinking establishments , primarily due to the introduction of gin . Gin was brought to England by the Dutch after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and became very popular after the government created a market for " cuckoo grain " or " cuckoo malt " that was unfit to be used in brewing and distilling by allowing unlicensed gin and beer production , while imposing a heavy duty on all imported spirits . As thousands of gin-shops sprang up all over England , brewers fought back by increasing the number of alehouses . By 1740 the production of gin had increased to six times that of beer and because of its cheapness it became popular with the poor , leading to the so-called Gin Craze . Over half of the 15,000 drinking establishments in London were gin shops .
The emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon . Emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy . The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics . Under certain conditions , it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria , while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug . For example , antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the Luria–Delbrück experiment . Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin , which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains , have become less effective , due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains .
Some researchers believe that the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the 17th century . According to this hypothesis , in 1648 several koches of Semyon Dezhnyov 's expedition came ashore in Alaska by storm and founded this settlement . This hypothesis is based on the testimony of Chukchi geographer Nikolai Daurkin , who had visited Alaska in 1764–1765 and who had reported on a village on the Kheuveren River , populated by " bearded men " who " pray to the icons " . Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with Koyuk River .
